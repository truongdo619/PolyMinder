# PolyMinder
PolyMinder is a web‑based support system that **automatically extracts, visualizes, and lets you refine polymer‑related entities and their relationships directly on scientific PDFs**. By combining state‑of‑the‑art NER and RE models with an intuitive React interface, PolyMinder turns what used to be a labor‑intensive annotation workflow into a fast, interactive experience.
