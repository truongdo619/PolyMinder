Limited understanding of heat transfer in polymers and polymer composites imposes restrictions on the designing and fabricating better thermally conductive polymers and polymer composites. This review attempts to help understand the thermal conduction mechanisms by analyzing the effects of different components in polymers and polymer composites on heat transfer. Factors of micro- and macro-characteristics, such as chain structures, interfaces, functionalization and processing techniques, etc., are all illustrated to elucidate their impacts on the thermal conductivities. In general, chain structures of polymers, intrinsic λ values of thermally conductive fillers and interfacial thermal resistances are the main and internal factors to determine the λ values of polymers and polymer composites. Meantime, processing and environmental factors are only auxiliary factors to improve the thermal conductivities. We expect this review will give some guidance to the future studies in thermally conductive polymers and polymer composites. ",

For gases, thermal conduction is the results of collisions among gas molecules during irregular thermal motion [18]. In electrically conductive solids, quite a few free electrons play a major role in thermal conduction [19]. In non-electrically conductive solids, thermal conduction is achieved by vibration of the lattice structures, that is, vibration of atoms and mole­ cules near their equilibrium position. The normal mode energy quantum of lattice vibration is called phonon, which can be understood as an analogous to photon [20]. The phonon has no mass and obeys the Bose-Einstein statistic. Its energy $\\varepsilon=h\\nu$ exists in the form of mechanical vibration in solids and part of liquids, the frequency is less than $50\\mathrm{THz}.$ , the group velocity is less than $2\\times10^{4}\\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{s}$ , and the mean free path is $10{-}100~\\mathrm{nm}$ (except for ultra-low temperature condition and nanotubes) [16]. For thermal conduction mechanism in liquids, there are currently two main viewpoints. One view is similar to that of gases, but situation is more complicated because the distance between liquid molecules is relatively close, and the interaction between the molecules has a greater influence on the collision process. The other viewpoint is like non-electrically conductive solids, mainly relying on the action of phonon [21]. ",

The main reason is that most polymers are in saturated sys­ tem, where there is nearly no free electron. Thermal conduction mainly relies on the thermal vibration of molecules or atoms around a fixed position, and the thermal energy is transmitted to adjacent molecules or atoms in turn, which can be considered as spring-mass system (Fig. 2a). Molecule chains or atoms vibrate when subjected to heat. Phonon is the main thermal energy carrier [23]. In the crystalline region of polymers, the atoms in the crystals connect with each other closely and vibrate slightly near equilibrium position, so that heat transfers rapidly in the direction of molecule chains [24,25]. However, the crystallinity is not very high due to random entanglement of the polymer chains and large relative molecule mass, and it is difficult to form complete crystals due to the polydispersity of molecule weight (Fig. 2b). In addition, the inharmonic vibration of the molecule chains and crystal lattice, boundaries of crystals, defects and so on, can lead to scattering of phonon and affect phonon transport, resulting in low λ values (Fig. 2c) [26].

Therefore, there is no signification improvement in λ values of the polymer com­ posites.

Moreover, phonon, as the main thermal energy carrier, does not have tunneling effects during heat transfer. Besides, defects and interfaces inner polymer composites make phonon scattering severe to hinder heat transfer. Therefore, there is almost no abrupt changes of $\\lambda$ value, though the loading of thermally conductive fillers is high enough.

The higher λ value of the composites, the greater thermoelastic coeffi­ cient and higher efficiency of phonon transmission (Fig. 3d) [41]. For polymer composites, the increase of $\\lambda$ value can be regarded as the combination enhancement of the highly thermally conductive fillers to polymer matrix. The $\\lambda$ value of the polymer composites gradually in­ crease with the increasing loading of thermally conductive fillers and will not produce an abrupt increase. Polymer matrix and thermally conductive fillers are two phases with different thermoelastic coefficient. Like the phenomenon that the vibration and the waves will reflect, refract and interfere at two-phase interfaces with different elastic coefficient, the phonon will also scatter and hinder the thermal conduction.

Polymer crystals have a denser chain arrangement than that in the amorphous regions.

Early studies indicated that the $\\lambda$ value of neat LDPE $(0.26~\\mathrm{W/mK})$ is lower than that of HDPE $(0.50~\\mathrm{W/mK})$ , proving that higher crystallinity results in higher thermal conductivity [45].

Most polymers cannot crystallize completely, and there are many interfaces between crystals and amorphous regions, so that the distri­ bution of the crystal regions also has great influence on λ values.

For polymer composites, Deng et al. studied the effect of CNT fillers on the crystallization properties and thermal conductivities of PPS and PPS composites. Results showed that the addition of CNT fillers could in­ crease the crystallinity of PPS matrix, and the thermal conductivity of the PPS composites at $8\\mathrm{wt}\\%$ CNT fillers were greatly improved to 0.42 $\\mathtt{W/m K}$ [69].

Orientation refers to the phe­ nomenon that the molecule chains or crystal ribbons, wafer, crystal grains, etc. of the polymers orient in the direction of the external force, presenting an important influence on the λ value (Fig. 5a) [68,70]. The λ value in the oriented direction is much higher than that of λ values in other directions, resulting in strong anisotropy, which can be explained by classical size effects. When the characteristic length, such as the thickness of the film or the diameter of the filament or the size of the fillers, is comparable to the mechanical length (phonon mean free path), the boundary or interface scattering of phonon becomes important, and the λ value is also related to the size, and it can also be anisotropic [16]. For some crystalline polymers, it is possible to form needle-shaped crystals composed of a considerable number of oriented molecule chains during orientation process, thereby greatly improving the $\\lambda$ value. Chen et al. reported a kind of PE fiber consisting of almost single crystals with a diameter of $50{-}500~\\mathrm{nm}$ after stretching, with $\\lambda$ value of up to $104~\\mathrm{W/mK}$ [71].

In addition, cross-linking is an important formation of covalent bonds among molecule chains.

In fact, there is always incompleteness and irregu­ larity in each crystal, such as point defects (vacancy and interstitial atoms), line defects (dislocations), surface defects (grain boundary and phase interfaces), body defects (cavities and bubbles) [130–132].

Non-graphitized carbon materials have small crystallite size, many defects such as lattice hollow spaces and disloca­ tions lead to low λ values, only $1/20{-}1/30$ times that of carbon materials after graphitization [140,141].

However, the factor of thermally conductive fillers loading was ignored.

So that the smaller size thermally conductive fillers are more conducive to forming thermal conduction paths & networks, in favor of the enhancement in λ values. However, the thermal conduction paths & networks have been formed completely when the thermally conductive fillers loading is appropriate. So that the number of interfaces formed between the larger size polymer matrix and thermally conductive fillers is much fewer, more favorable to the enhancement in λ values [149,150]. Ren et al. added BN with different particle size into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Results showed that when the BN loading was less than $10\\mathrm{~wt}\\%$ , the λ value of BN/PDMS composites with $2.0~{\\upmu\\mathrm{m}}$ BN fillers was higher than that of BN/PDMS composites with $160.0~\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$ BN. When the BN loading was higher than $10\\mathrm{wt}\\%$ , the $\\lambda$ value of the BN/PDMS composites with $160.0\\upmu\\mathrm{m}$ BN fillers improved faster than the other one [151]. Park et al. observed similar results in epoxy composites by adding multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) with different length. The λ value of the MWCNT/epoxy composites $(55~\\mathrm{W/mK})$ with long MWCNT was higher than that of MWCNT/epoxy composites $(20\\mathrm{W/mK})$ with short MWCNT at the same loading $(60\\mathrm{~wt}\\%)$ [152].

Contact areas directly affect the contact thermal re­ sistances among thermally conductive fillers, which in turn affects the λ values of polymer composites [137]. Spherical fillers form point contact, linear fillers form line contact, and the laminar fillers form surface contact. Experimental results of Fu et al. showed that the lamellar fillers were greater than the spherical fillers in improving the $\\lambda$ values of the epoxy composites, and was higher than the polyhedral fillers with lots of angular edges [99]. In addition, for linear fillers (CNT, CF, nanowires, etc.) and lamellar fillers (expanded graphite, graphene, BNNS, etc.), their λ values have strong anisotropy due to their own structural character­ istics. However, the λ values of spherical fillers are generally isotropic. Therefore, the λ values of polymer composites will also be related to the orientation of the thermally conductive fillers. ",

        "text": "In view of the complexity of the shape and size of the thermally conductive fillers, it is more uniform to use aspect ratio (ratio of diam­ eter to thickness, or length to diameter) to illustrate fillers’ influences on the λ values of polymer composites [153,154]. Assuming that the ther­ mally conductive fillers are freely dispersed in polymer matrix, the length of linear or lamellar fillers is much longer than spherical fillers at the same fillers’ loading. Phonon transports more easily along the linear or lamellar fillers and facilitate thermal conduction in polymer composites. Finite element analyses also proved the above conclusions [155]. Moreover, the high aspect ratio makes the thermally conductive fillers easily overlap with each other, forming high aspect ratio aggre­ gate structures called “grape”, which can form thermal conduction paths with lower thermal resistance (Fig. 9) [101]. However, the aspect ratio has no effects on the thermal conduction mechanism at macroscopic scale [154]. Yu et al. showed that the λ value of the GNPs/epoxy com­ posites increased as the aspect ratio of GNPs increases, and at the highest aspect ratio (200), the $\\lambda$ value of the GNPs/epoxy composites with 5.4 $\\mathrm{vol\\%}$ GNPs reached $1.45~\\mathrm{W/mK}$ . However, the λ value of the GNPs/e­ poxy composites with the lowest aspect ratio (30) of GNPs was only 1.08 $\\mathtt{W/m K}$ [156]. Based on the advantages in thermal conduction of high aspect ratio, many scholars are dedicated to studying thermally conductive fillers with high aspect ratio. For example, the exfoliation of BN into BNNS can increase its λ value to $300~\\mathrm{W/mK}$ and greatly in­ creases the $\\lambda$ values of the polymer composites. The λ value of BNNS/PVDF composite film prepared by Chen et al. reached $16.3\\mathrm{W/mK}$ with $33\\mathrm{wt}\\%$ BNNS, 43 times higher than that of pure PVDF film [111]. There was also a kind of high-quality monolayer BNNS directly prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), realizing the outstanding λ value of 751 W/mK [93]. ",

Besides, the excessive size increases the probability of de­ fects in thermally conductive polymer composites. All these factors are unfavorable to improving the λ values. Kim and Roy et al. confirmed that the λ values of the polymer composites increased with the increasing aspect ratio, until its value reached a certain value.

As mentioned before, phonon scattering at the interfaces would greatly reduce the efficiency of thermal conduction. Therefore, how to reduce the interfaces or to improve the interfacial performance is the key issue in the thermally conductive polymer composites [159,160]. In addition, due to the dif­ ference in polarity between polymer matrix and thermally conductive fillers, the corresponding interfacial compatibility is poor, making fillers difficult to effectively disperse in polymer matrix. Especially for nano-sized thermally conductive fillers, their large surface energy makes their agglomeration in polymer matrix particularly severe [161]. Moreover, the surface of the thermally conductive fillers is difficult to be effectively wetted by polymer matrix, voids and defects are always presented at interfaces, which further increase the interfacial thermal resistances [91,162–164]. In the past few decades, researchers have carried out different surface functionalization works on the thermally conductive fillers, including mechanochemical method [165–168], chemical modification [169–172], acid-base treatment [173–176] and surface coating [177–187], etc., in improving the λ values of the polymer composites.

Huang et al. used six kinds of coupling agents to functionalize AlN fillers and found that covalent bonding led to an increase in λ value below the critical concentration. However, above the critical concentration, the increase in the λ value by covalent bonding was limited (Fig. 10b) [172]. Under the optimal dosage, the coupling agent molecules fully react with polymer matrix and thermally conductive fillers. The interfaces between polymer matrix and thermally conductive fillers are very thin and the bonding is tight, which effec­ tively improves the interfacial performance.

The coating mechanism mainly includes: (1) Coulomb electrostatic interaction mechanism. Coating molecule has an opposite charge to thermally conductive fillers, the Coulomb force makes them be absorbed together and then coating molecule reacts with each other to form coating layer on the surface of fillers [180]. (2) Chemical bond mechanism. Strong chemical bond is formed between coating molecule and thermally conductive fillers to form a dense coating layer. The premise is that the thermally conductive fillers surface has certain functional groups [181]. (3) Supersaturation mechanism. When a heterogeneous substance exists at a certain $\\mathrm{pH}_{\\mathrm{:}}$ , if the solution exceeds its supersaturation, a large amount of nucleation will be formed, and deposition on the surface of the heterogeneous fillers will form a coating layer [182]. The principle of surface coating is satisfying the cohesiveness and coexistence of the interphase thermodynamics, and good wettability between coating layer and thermally conductive fillers. The main methods include solid phase coating (mechanical mixing, solid phase reaction), liquid phase coating (hydrothermal, sol-gel, precipitation, microemulsion, etc.) and vapor phase coating [183–185].

By adding hybrid thermally conductive fillers (different shapes or types) into polymer matrix, the polymer composites would have better thermal conductivities than those with single type of thermally conductive fillers. The main reason is attributed that the hybrid thermally conductive fillers can improve the dispersion performance of the ther­ mally conductive fillers in polymer matrix, or more easily bridge the adjacent thermally conductive fillers to form thermal conduction paths, or help reducing the voids in polymer matrix, etc [10,190,191].

The roles and effects of the interface are mainly manifested via three aspects: transfer effect, blocking effect, scattering and absorption effect. The transfer effect means that the interface acts as a bridge between polymer matrix and thermally conductive fillers, ensuring the continuity of the polymer matrix and thermally conductive fillers, achieving efficient transfer of properties between the components [212]. The blocking effect manifests in the fact that the appropriate interface has the effect of preventing crack propagation and mitigating stress concentration [213].

Huxtable et al. used picosecond transient absorption to measure the interface thermal conductance (G) value of CNT suspended in sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDS) micelles in water. $G$ value between CNT and SDS was about $12~\\mathrm{MW/(m^{2}K)}$ . It indicated that the SDS molecules did not form chemical bonds with CNT, but interacted by weak van der Waals force. Therefore, CNT and SDS molecules could only transfer thermal energy from CNT to surrounding SDS molecules by phonon-phonon coupling in the low frequency range. In addition, this work proved that the weak van der Waals forces had little effect on the $G$ value [215]. To further improve the G value between solid and polymer matrix, Zheng et al. used spin coating to change the interfacial adhesion between PS film and sapphire. Although the $G$ value increased with the enhancement of interfacial adhesion, the range of improvement was limited to $21\\pm4.2$ $\\mathrm{{MW/(m^{2}K)}}$ .

Losego et al. calculated the inter­ action force and $G$ value of methyl $\\left(\\mathrm{-CH}_{3}\\right)$ , halogen (-Br), amino $\\left(\\mathrm{-NH}_{2}\\right)$ and sulfhydryl (-SH) with Au substrates. Results showed that the –SH/Au system had the highest chemical bonding force and the $G$ value reached $65~\\mathrm{MW}/(\\mathrm{m}^{2}\\mathrm{K})$ (Fig. 14) [218]. Luo et al. designed alkane molecules with different chain length. All molecules were bonded onto the surface of the Au film with the same Au–S bond. It revealed that the carbon chain length of the organic molecules had 12 carbon atoms, presenting the highest $G$ value. After increasing the length of carbon chains, the $G$ value was reduced. However, according to molecule dy­ namic simulation, the $G$ value increased with the length of carbon chains and there was no inflection point. The theoretical calculation results did not match the experimental results. The reason was that the C–C single bond could be freely rotated when the molecule length of the carbon chain was greater than 12 carbon atoms, which caused the carbon chains to be easily bent and folded together, and the local organic molecule arrangement regularity was lowered. Therefore, the phonon propaga­ tion free paths in the long-chain molecules reduced, the phonon scat­ tering increased, and the $G$ value was relatively lower [219]. ",

Moderate cross-linking between molecule chains is conducive to building thermal conduction paths and improving thermal conductivities. Rashidi et al. introduced cross-linking agent in PMMA. When the chain length of the cross-linking agent was short, the $\\lambda$ value of PMMA enhanced. However, as the crosslinker chain length increased, the λ value of PMMA decreased. In addition, excessive cross-linking would increase phonon scattering and reduce λ value [220]. Kikugawa et al. studied the relationship between the $\\lambda$ value of PS matrix and the crosslink density by non-equilibrim molecule dynamics. It revealed that the λ value of PS increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of crosslink density, and reached the maximum $(0.20~\\mathrm{W/mK})$ when the crosslink density was $40\\%$ , 0.04 $\\mathsf{W/m K}$ higher than that of pure PS $(0.16~\\mathrm{W/mK})$ [78]. For polymer composites, a large number of thermally conductive fillers have been achieved by covalent bonding with polymer matrix, to increase the $\\lambda$ values of the polymer composites [221–223]. Vu et al. functionalized rGO with isocyanatoethylmetharcylate (IEMA) to obtain functionalized rGO (frGO), which could form covalent bonds with acrylic copolymer pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA). The $\\lambda$ value of the frGO/PSA com­ posites with $1\\mathrm{~wt}\\%$ frGO increased to $1.03\\mathrm{W/mK}_{}$ while the $\\lambda$ value of rGO/PSA composites hardly showed enhancement compared with PSA matrix [224].

The reason is that the chemical modification of graphene destroys the perfect structure of the graphene surface, reducing the phonon mean free path and increasing the phonon scattering. Therefore, the λ value of the modified graphene has been greatly reduced and the prepared polymer composites do not achieve the expectation [225]. ",

Such bonding method usually uses Lewis acid and alkali, hydrogen bonds, $\\pi{-}\\pi$ stacking, etc., in which electrons of one molecule interact with empty orbits of another mole­ cule, to form non-contact chemical force close to the strength of covalent bond [226–228]. Yu et al. utilized Lewis acid-base complexation be­ tween electron-rich amine groups in octadecylamine (ODA) and electron-deficient boron atoms on the surface of BNNS, not only improving the dispersion of BNNS, but also improving the λ values of the fabricated ODA-BNNS/epoxy composites. When the loading of ODA-BNNS was $5\\mathrm{~wt}\\%$ , the λ value of the ODA-BNNS/epoxy composites increased from $0.26~\\mathrm{W/mK}$ of pure epoxy resin to $0.31\\mathrm{W/mK},$ also superior to the λ value of the BNNS/epoxy composites blended with the same loading of BNNS [229]. As a typical non-covalent bond, hydrogen bond is 10–100 times stronger than van der Waals force, which can effectively improve the λ values of the polymer composites, but related to the hydrogen bond strength and type. In the work of Kim et al., poly (N-acryloyl piperidine) (PAP) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), poly(4-vinyl phenol) (PVPh) were mixed to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The addition of PAA, PVA and PVPh could improve the λ value of PAP to some extent, but the improvement effect was different. Hydrogen bond strength of PAP/PVPh, PAP/PAA, PAP/PVA was from large to small, but the λ value of PAP/PAA was the maximum (1.5 W/mK), followed by PAP/PVA $(0.38~\\mathrm{~W/mK})$ and PAP/PVPh (less than $0.3~\\mathrm{W/mK)}$ . The difference in λ values between PAP/PAA and PAP/PVA was mainly caused by hydrogen bond strength. However, the lower λ value of PAP/PVPh was mainly due to the fact that the hydroxyl group providing hydrogen bond of PVPh was not con­ nected to its backbone (Fig. 15) [22]. ",

It is easy to disperse thermally conductive fillers along the axial direction of the polymer fibers, reducing the separation distances among the thermally conductive fillers, beneficial to overlaping with each other to form thermal conduction paths [233]. Besides, electrospinning can simulta­ neously improve the orientation of the molecule chains themselves, thereby improving the intrinsic λ value of the polymer matrix [73]. Chen et al. used electrospinning technology to achieve the orientation align­ ment of BNNS on PVDF fibers, which greatly improved the λ values of the BNNS/PVDF films in planar direction $(16.3~\\mathrm{W/mK},$ with BNNS loading of $33\\mathrm{~wt}\\%$ (Fig. 16a) [111]. In addition, Gu et al. design the combined method of “blending-electrospinning-hot pressing” to prepare thermally conductive polymer composites, which achieved the orderly arrangement of thermally conductive fillers on the surface of or inside the electrospun polymer fibers [234–236]. On the basis of this, the in-situ polymerization is used to further improve the uniform dispersion of the thermally conductive fillers in polymer matrix, realizing the highly efficient formation of thermal conduction paths, and great enhancement in $\\lambda$ is achieved with relatively low addition of thermally conductive fillers [121, 237]. In addition, based on the relationship of “phonon scattering-interfacial thermal resistance-thermal conductivity”, the interfacial thermal resistance was calculated according to optimized Hashin-Shtrikman model, effective medium theory (EMT) and Foygel models, revealing the root causes in improving λ values of the polymer composites by functionalizing fillers and electrospinning technology [48, 233, 238].

Results showed the $\\lambda$ value of the diamond/ABS composites with $60\\mathrm{~wt}\\%$ diamond increased from $0.17~\\mathrm{W/mK}$ of pure ABS to $0.94~\\mathrm{W/mK}$ [257].

GF/PA6 composites prepared by SP method had higher λ values. The main reason was that the GF/PA6 composites by SP could form thermal conduction networks in planar direction at a lower GF loading, and the orientation of the GF was consistent with the planar (y-axis) direction [258]. Multi-field coupling can make full use of the electrical and magnetic properties of the thermally conductive fillers, and provide a new method for preparing polymer composites with high λ values [259]. Thermally conductive fillers could align on a specific direction under electric or magnetic fields, which not only solves the dispersion, but also improves the contact probability of the thermally conductive fillers. Each material has different degree of galvanic polarization under applied electric field, and tends to be aligned along the direction of the applied electric field. Electric fields with different frequency and intensity can be applied to the polymer mixtures, changing the thermally conductive fillers’ arrangement and distribution in polymer matrix, and to obtain polymer composites with high λ value in a certain direction (Fig. 20a) [260–266].
