Polyethersulfone (PES)–beta zeolite $/\\mathrm{PES}\\mathrm{-Al}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{3}$ dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fiber membranes with enhanced separation performance have been fabricated. This study presents an innovative approach of utilizing low cost PES and $\\mathrm{{Al}_{2}\\mathrm{{O}_{3}}}$ to replace expensive polyimides as the supporting medium for dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fibers and eliminating interlayer de-lamination problems. The incorporations of $20\\mathrm{wt}\\%$ beta zeolite in the outer selective layer and 60 wt% $\\mathrm{{Al}_{2}\\mathrm{{O}_{3}}}$ in the inner layer coupled with spinning at high elongational draw ratios yield membranes with an $\\mathrm{O}_{2}/\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ selectivity of 6.89. The presence of $\\mathrm{{Al}}_{2}\\mathrm{{O}}_{3}$ particles enables the membrane to retain its porous substructure morphology in the course of annealing above the glass transition temperature of PES. Moreover, spinning at high elongational draw ratios results in the re-distribution of $\\mathsf{A l}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{3}$ particles towards both edges of the inner layer. Not only do the permeance and selectivity of the fibers increase, but also greater mechanical properties and lower degree of shrinkages are obtained. Therefore, the combination of PES–beta zeolite and PES– $\\mathsf{A l}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{3}$ nanoparticles with a reasonable draw ratio may be another promising approach to produce hollow fibers with double-layer mixed-matrix materials.

Recently, the application of mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) for gas separation has attracted worldwide interest due to the potentially synergetic effects that can be reaped. To date, several research groups have demonstrated the feasibility of some molecularly engineered MMMs in flat, dense forms which comprised of inorganic particles like zeolites, carbon molecular sieves and others [1,2,4–16]. Nevertheless, the technical difficulties encountered in fabricating continuous and defect-free flat asymmetric or hollow fiber membranes hinder the progress of utilizing these organic–inorganic hybrids for industrial applications [17–21]. Therefore, a significant breakthrough on fabricating MMMs in useful configurations is undoubtedly essential and this signifies one immediate challenge for membrane researchers. ",

Therefore, further comprehensive research on MMMs should be devoted to the successful integration of inorganic particles to polymericbased hollow fiber membranes. Pioneering works on single-layer mixed-matrix hollow fiber membranes have revealed the need of a new fabrication approach that reduces material costs and provides greater flexibility for further modifications and improvements [28]. MMMs production by means of dual layer co-extrusion spinning technology opens up more application opportunities [28–33]. The exploitation of this technique effectively reduces fabrication costs and facilitates the control of inorganic particle distribution, i.e., introducing inorganic fillers primarily to the thin selective layer.

[28]. The key factors influencing the nanoparticle distribution are: (1) shear within the spinneret, (2) die swell following dope extrusion from the annulus spinneret and (3) elongational drawing in the air gap. Subsequently, the fabrication of dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fiber membranes were further developed by Chung and coworkers [29–31]. Currently, there exists a major challenge faced by researchers in fabricating dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fiber membranes for gas separation. The conventional phase inversion process makes it difficult to obtain a mixed-matrix selective layer without severe polymer/particle interfacial voids. The presence of these undesirable interfacial voids diminishes the gas separation performance of MMMs and hence, this problem needs to be rectified. ",

        "text": "In view of the anticipated requirement for post-treatment to reduce or eliminate interfacial voids, the material selection for the inner and outer layers is important. Typically, the working polymers for the outer and inner layers should have a vast difference in their glass transition temperatures $(T_{\\mathrm{g}})$ . In particular, the $T_{\\mathrm{{g}}}$ of the polymer constituting the support layer should be significantly higher than the polymer used for the mixed-matrix layer. This allows the subsequent heat treatment to reduce or eliminate voids in the selective mixed-matrix layer without increasing the substructure resistance of the support layer [29–31]. Similar heat treatments may be utilized to eradicate the problem of delamination occurring between the inner and outer layers. Therefore, the related works on dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fiber membranes reported by Chung and co-workers’ group [28–31] typically employ glassy polymers with relatively low $T_{\\mathrm{{g}}}$ (e.g. polysulfone (PSf) and polyethersulfone (PES)) for the mixed-matrix layer, while glassy polyimides with high $T_{\\mathrm{g}}$ (e.g. Matrimid and P84) are used for the support layer. From the engineering point of view, this approach has solved the problem of interfacial voids effectively. However, it is certainly not practical from the economical aspect since higher production cost is incurred as a result of using costly polyimides (e.g. approximately ∼USD 550/kg Matrimid) for the support layer. This raises an issue of whether the costly polymer can be replaced with a cheaper alternative, hence the primary goal in our present study. ",

It is found that the combination of the indented spinneret and inorganic nanoparticles synergistically results in MMMs with enhanced mechanical properties, faster spinning speed, looser substructure resistance, and greater overall separation performance. This inspires us to further explore the feasibility of designing dual-layer MMMs with both inner and outer layers made of mixed-matrix materials. Not only can it substitute expensive polyimide materials with less costly composite materials for the support layer, but also the addition of $\\mathsf{A l}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{3}$ nanoparticles in the support layer probably enhances the gas separation performance and mechanical strength of the resultant membranes, even after heat treatment at above the $T_{\\mathrm{{g}}}$ of the top selective layer.

Although the defects between polymer and beta zeolite particle in the outer layer’s outer surface are almost invisible at a magnification of 50,000 (i.e., the left-upper SEM picture) but an interfacial gap between the polymer and beta zeolite in the outer layer’s edge (i.e., the right-bottom picture) can be obviously observed. Normally in the dual-layer mixed-matrix fibers, heat treatment has been a common method to reduce or eliminate the voids between polymer matrix and particles [29–31].

However, no permeance can be detected for the post-annealed dual-layer fibers that contain no $\\mathrm{{Al}}_{2}\\mathrm{{O}}_{3}$ nanoparticle because of significant structure densification after heat treatment at elevated temperatures. In comparison to the intrinsic $\\mathsf{O}_{2}/\\mathsf{N}_{2}$ selectivity (6.4) of the PES–zeolite beta mixed-matrix flat dense membranes [30], the dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fiber with $40\\mathsf{w t\\%}\\mathsf{A l_{2}}0_{3}$ nanoparticle loading shows a much lower $\\mathrm{O}_{2}/\\mathrm{N}_{2}$ selectivity of 1.33–1.77 with an unimpressive $_{0_{2}}$ permeance when the heat treatment took place at $235^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and above. This is due to the fact that the substructure resistance in the inner layer comes into effect after heat treatment and hence results in a simultaneous reduction in both permeance and selectivity, which has been proven by SEM images in Fig. 2.

This phenomenon arises from the fact that higher $\\mathrm{{Al}}_{2}\\mathrm{{O}}_{3}$ loadings could retain the porous substructure during heat treatment and thus lead to insignificant substructure resistance. Further characterizations, i.e., measurements of mechanical strength and degree of shrinkage, will be discussed later to demonstrate the above speculation. ",

From this point of view, it seems that the selectivity enhancement for the two gas pairs contradicts the ideal molecular sieving mechanism. However, the results are consistent with the previous reports because there are several mechanisms involved in selectivity improvement [10,14,15,42,43]; namely, (1) polymer chain rigidification near the particles; (2) pore opening reduction due to the partial pore blockage; (3) the orientation of the pore opening of the beta zeolite in the fiber’s outer layer relatively to the direction of gas flow.

However, the use of two-step coatings procedure alone without applying heat treatment could not seal the defects. This might be due to the defects between particle and polymer still beyond the curing range of two-step coatings. The superiority of two-step coatings over one step one, i.e., silicon rubber coating, to cure defects in the mixed-matrix dual-layer hollow fibers has been demonstrated and discussed in details by Jiang et al. [29] and can be briefly explained in Fig. 4. The concept of two-step coatings was first proposed by DuPont scientists [40] and its superiority to cure the defects in the mixed-matrix hollow fiber membranes has been further patented [33]. Following their work, Jiang et al. [1] have successfully applied the two-step coating method to seal the defects in their dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fibers. As compared to the common silicon rubber coating, it has shown a more superior gas separation performance. Two possible reasons might be due to: (1) the defects between particles and the polymer are still beyond the curing range of silicon rubber coating; (2) the hydrophobic silicon rubber may partially detach from the surface of the hydrophilic zeolite. The introduction of the reactive chemicals tends to form some stable structures between the particle surface and the polymer matrix might help to tighten the hollow fiber surface structure as well as trap the silicon rubber in the gaps more effectively.

Since the zeolite and polysulfone contain hydroxyl and sulfone groups, respectively, it is thought that the amines in the diethyltoluenediamines could induce the hydrogen bonding with the hydroxyl and sulfone groups. Besides the hydrogen bonding, the 1,3,5-benzenetricarbonyl chloride may react with the amine producing an amide group. Consequently, the network resulted from these two reactions help to narrow the gap between the particles and the polymer, which can trap the silicon rubber chains effectively. ",

        "text": "It has been proven in our previous works [28,35,44], that the particle distribution across the fiber’s wall transforms from a convex induced by the shear stress within the spinneret to a concave profiles induced by the elongation stress in the air gap region as the elongational draw ratio increases from a free-fall spinning to a high elongational draw spinning. In this work, we believe that there are two types of particle movements as a function of elongational draw ratio, namely: (1) migration of beta zeolite particles in the outer layer towards outer layer’s outer edge and (2) movement of $\\mathsf{A l}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{3}$ particles in the inner layer towards both edges, since two different particles were applied simultaneously in the outer and inner layers. The migration of both particles from the middle portion to the edge of fibers as a function of elongational draw ratio can be determined qualitatively from the increasing number of particles in the outer layer’s outer edge of the fibers shown in the SEM images in Fig. 5. In conjunction, SEM-EDX images of $\\mathsf{A l}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{3}$ particles in the fiber’s cross-section in Fig. 6 further confirms that there is a shift in $\\mathsf{A l}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{3}$ particles from the middle part to both edges with an increase in elongation draw ratio. However, the aluminium (Al) intensity near the outer edge of fibers might as well include the Al content of beta zeolite, since it also consists of Al element. The effects of elongational draw ratio on the number of particles in the outer surface, the AFM topology and mean roughness calculation (Ra) of the outer surface are shown in Fig. 7. It can be observed that the number of nanoparticles residing in the inner layer’s outer surface increases with an increase in elongational draw ratio. Simultaneously, the increment of mean roughness in the outer surface of fibers from $13.8\\mathrm{nm}$ at $\\varphi=4.5$ to $67.9\\mathrm{nm}$ at $\\varphi=32.1$ further supports the occurrence of particle distribution movement when spinning at a high elongational draw ratio.

        "text": "The migration of nanoparticles towards the edge has multiple effects. It will results in more micro-defects beneath the PES–beta zeolite layer (as shown in right-bottom figure of Fig. 1); thus creates more channels for gas transportation and reduces the substructure resistance. Since nanoparticles are accumulated towards both edges of the inner layer, elongated polymer chains would dominate in the middle part of the fiber cross-section. As a result, the fiber mechanical strength is improved and its shrinkage in the radial direction is reduced during heat treatment. Both the mechanical data tabulated in Table 6 and the degrees of thermal shrinkage shown in Fig. 8 confirm our hypotheses. All mechanical properties including tensile strength, Young’s modulus and elongation at break increase with an increase in elongation draw ratio from 4.5 to 14.7. Therefore, the combination of PES–beta zeolite and $\\mathsf{P E S}\\mathrm{-Al}_{2}\\mathsf{O}_{3}$ nanoparticles with a reasonable draw ratio may be another promising approach to produce double-mixed-matrix hollow fibers.
