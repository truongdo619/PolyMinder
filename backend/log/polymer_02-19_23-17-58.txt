Moreover, the dilution condition should be applied to suppress the concurrent chain extension. In consequence, this bimolecular process is now', 'recognized as a less attractive choice for the preparation of cyclic polymers in practice (Scheme 1A). ', 'A significantly improved means by an alternative unimolecular process has subsequently been introduced to prepare cyclic polymers (Scheme 1B). It was first demonstrated by using an asymmetrically functional telechelic precursor, a-acetal-u-styryl polystyrene,7 and the subsequent end-to-end polymer cyclization through the deprotection/activation treatment. This unimolecular process with asymmetrically functional telechelic precursors has been extended by employing alternative pairs of the reactive groups. Thus, an a-amino-u-carboxyl polystyrene and poly(tert-butyl acrylate) were prepared through a living polymerization using an initiator having a protected amino group, followed by the end-capping reaction to introduce a carboxylic group.8 The resulting asymmetric telechelic precursor underwent, after the deprotection, an intramolecular amidation reaction to give a ring polymer product effectively. Alternatively, an a-(furan-pro-tected)-maleimide-u-cyclopentadienylpoly(methylmethacry-late) and poly(tert-butyl acrylate) were prepared through the ATRP using a protected maleimide initiator and the subsequent introduction of a cyclopentadienyl group at the living end with the nickelocene methodology.9 The obtained asymmetric tele-chelic precursor was subjected to the heat treatment to cause the spontaneous deprotection followed by an intramolecular Diels–Alder addition reaction to give a ring polymer product effectively.9 It is notable, however, that these processes using telechelic precursors having potentially reactive groups require multistep protection/deprotection treatments. ', 'A versatile unimolecular process has recently been introduced by employing a click reaction using asymmetrically functional telechelic polystyrene having an alkyne and an azide group.10 The introduction of these two functional groups at the polymer chain-ends could be performed conveniently, and they can react with each other upon the addition of a Cu catalyst.11 Therefore, this click polymer cyclization has been applied to prepare such functional ring polymers, as poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide)12,13', 'and poly(caprolactone)14 as well as poly(valerolactone)15 to elucidate their topology-effect on phase transition, and on biodegradation, respectively, detailed in the later section. This unimolecular click process has also been employed to construct complex cyclic structures, either having multiple polymer segment components16 or having multicyclic as well as cyclic/ linear hybrid polymer segments.17 On the other hand, the bimo-lecular click process using an azide-ended bifunctional telechelic precursor and a bifunctional alkyne compound as a linking reagentproceedslesseffectivelythantheunimolecular counterpart.18', 'Another effective unimolecular process has been developed using symmetrically functional telechelic precursors, which are readily obtainable through a direct end-capping reaction of living bifunctional polymers (Scheme 1C).18–23 Thus, telechelic poly(tetrahydrofuran), poly(acrylic ester) and poly(isobutene) having olefinic end groups were prepared through the relevant living polymerization followed by the end-capping reaction. The subsequent metathesis condensation, i.e., metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC), in the presence of a Grubbs catalyst pro-ceeded effectively to give the corresponding ring polymers in high yields even under dilution.18–20 This MPC process has further been applied for the practical synthesis of amphiphilic cyclic', 'Scheme 1Ring polymer synthesis by (A) a bimolecular process, (B) a unimolecular process with asymmetric telechelics, (C) a unimolecular process with symmetric telechelics, (D) a ring-expansion polymerization process and (E) an electrostatic self-assembly and covalent fixation (ESA-CF) process.', 'This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011Polym.

This process does not require dilution in contrast to the end-to-end polymer cyclization process by linear polymer precursors, while a reactive initiator fragment is inherently included in the final ring polymer structure. Thus until recently, the ring-expansion process has been considered as a less practical means, since it is not an easy task to maintain the ring topology of the product while eliminating the initiator residues.26', 'A number of new processes have recently been developed to address this problem in the ring-expansion polymerization (Scheme 2). Thus, a new Ru catalyst bearing a cyclic ligand containing the Ru-alkylidene unit has been introduced and applied for the ring-expansion polymerization of cyclic olefins such as 1,5-cyclooctadiene or cyclooctene.27 During the chain-growth process, the chain transfer to the Ru-alkylidene unit took place to eliminate the initiator complex, and consequently a ring polybutadiene or a ring poly(cyclooctene) free of the catalyst fragment, respectively, is produced. The obtained ring poly(cyclooctene)wasthenhydrogenatedtogivearing polyethylene, showing distinctive properties in comparison with commercial linear polyethylenes (Scheme 2A).27,28 It is notable,', 'at the same time, that the random nature of this chain transfer process inherently causes the broadening of the molecular weight distribution of the product. This process has now been applied with a bulky, dendronized monomer to construct a ring nano-object directly observable by atomic force microscopy (AFM).29', 'More recently, a new N-heterocyclic carbene initiator was introduced for the ring-expansion polymerization of lactones or lactide to form ring polyesters or polylactide, respectively (Scheme 2B).30,31 Remarkably, the obtained ring polymers possess narrow molecular weight distributions through the elimination of the initiator fragment after the quantitative consumption of the monomer, in contrast to the metathesis ring-expansion process shown before.28 By exploiting the living character, this technique has subsequently been applied for the synthesis of ring block polypeptoids and of complex topological polymers having a ring with many branches, i.e., jellyfish poly-mers.32,33 A further development of the ring-expansion process would provide a wider variety of chemical structures in ring polymers by broadening the choice of monomer types. ', 'The combination of the classical ring-expansion polymeriza-tion process, in which the initiator fragment is included within the ring polymer structure, with the end-to-end polymer cycli-zation process could provide a new effective means for ring polymers having, in particular, large sizes (Scheme 2C).34 Thus, a ring poly(caprolactone) having short photocrosslinkable block segments was prepared through a sequential living ring-expan-sion polymerization using a cyclic stannate initiator. The subsequent irradiation under dilution caused the intramolecular covalent linking of the two short segments.

It is remarkable, moreover, that a small portion of nanoobjects corresponding to complex ring polymers having tadpole, 8-shaped, catenated and knotted forms were also identified. This showed, for the first time, that not only single-cyclic but also various complex cyclic polymer topologies are indeed produced through the polymer cyclization process, as previously shown in DNA systems.37', 'An electrostatic self-assembly and covalent fixation (ESA-CF) process has been introduced for the effective synthesis of not only cyclic but also functionalized cyclic and multicyclic polymers, where linear or star telechelic polymers having cyclic ammonium salt groups accompanying small or polymeric plurifunctional carboxylate counteranions are employed as key precursors (Scheme 1E).38–40 Various telechelic polymers have been conve-niently prepared through the relevant living polymerization fol-lowed by the end-capping/end-conversion technique. The choice of such particular types of cyclic ammonium salt end groups as five- and six-membered cyclic ammonium, i.e., N-phenyl-pyrrolidinium and N-phenylpiperidinium salt groups, respec-tively, is of a crucial importance in the ESA-CF process (Scheme 3).41 The former undergoes upon heating a selective ring-opening reaction by a carboxylate counteranion to form an amino ester group through the nucleophilic attack exclusively at the N-adjacent ring (endo) position. On the other hand, the latter having unstrained six-membered cyclic ammonium salt groups gives a chemically more stable, simple ester group through the nucleophilic attack at the alternative N-adjacent (exo) position, to eliminate N-phenylpiperidine. ', 'And in the electrostatic polymer self-assembly, the cations at the end of the telechelics and the anions in the carboxylates counteranions always balance the charges. Upon the dilution, the self-assembly tends to dissociate into one having the smallest number of polymer components by keeping the balance of the charges (Scheme 4). Thus, when a self-assembly comprised of', 'a linear telechelic precursor, typically poly(THF), having cyclic ammonium salt groups accompanying either a dicarboxylate or a tetracarboxylate counteranion was heated at dilution, the selective ring-opening reaction of the cyclic ammonium groups took place to produce single-cyclic (ring) or dicyclic (8-shaped) polymerproducts,respectively,inhighyields.38,42Ring poly(THF)s having the molecular weights of up to 10 000, cor-responding to the ring size of as high as 700 atoms, were obtainable and characterized unequivocally by the MALDI-TOF mass technique. Furthermore, the ESA-CF process with dynamic equilibrium nature has been exploited to construct various multicyclic as well as cyclic-linear hybrid polymer topologies (Scheme 5).6', 'Moreover, ring polymers possessing the prescribed functional groups at the designated positions, i.e., kyklo-telechelics and cyclic macromonomer, have also been prepared by employing telechelic precursors possessing such functional groups as hydroxyl, olefinic, acetylenic, and azide groups at the designated, typically a center, position by using the relevant initiator, or by introducing functional linking reagents.43 They were subse-quently applied to construct more complex polymer topologies either through the covalent linkage or even through the non-covalent, mechanical linkage uniquely formed by threading with ring polymer units.44,45 It was also shown that network polymers formed from cyclic polymer precursors exhibited unique gel properties compared with conventional gels obtained with linear/ branched polymer precursors.46 Moreover, the topological conversion of polymers between ring/linear and even between single-cyclic/dicyclic topologies has now been achieved.45,47,48', 'By the combination of the ESA-CF protocol with selective covalent linking chemistry, a wide variety of multi-cyclic as well as cyclic-linear conjugated polymers have been synthesized.49 In particular, the combination of the ESA-CF process with the metathesis condensation and with the click process has now been revealed as a versatile means to construct a variety of complex multicyclic polymer topologies of fused-, spiro- and bridged forms (Scheme 6).50 Both the functional ring polymer precursors and thecovalentlylinkedmulticyclicpolymerproductwere unequivocally characterized by means of a series of spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques including MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy and SEC. As shown in Fig. 1, for a typical example, the structure of the polymer products having complex multicyclic topologies is convincingly demonstrated.

Thus, the Tg of ring polymers is higher than the linear counter-part, until the polymer chain length becomes long enough to diminish the contribution of the chain end. On the contrary, the hydrodynamic volume or the melt viscosity of ring polymers is inherently smaller than their linear counterparts irrespective of their chain lengths. This indicates the distinctive conception in the topology effect by ring polymers. The latter is regarded as an inherent topology effect by ring polymers, while the former as the depletion effect of the polymer chain ends. Nevertheless, the elimination of the chain ends of polymer molecules inevitably leads to the formation of cyclic constructions to bring the topology effect, now drawing increasing interests to discover unusual properties and functions in polymer materials covering mechanical, thermal, electric, photonic and bio-related applica-tions either in bulk or at surface. From an experimental point of', 'view, moreover, further developments are awaited to provide ring polymers possessing high molecular weights with guaran-teed purity, since the mixing of even small amount of linear counterpartmightcauseinconclusiveorevenerroneous conclusions on the topology effect by ring polymers.', '4.Topology effects on basic polymer properties: ', 'simulations and experiments from simple to complex cyclic polymers', 'Basic characteristics of single-cyclic (ring) homopolymers either in solution or bulk, in static or dynamic states, have extensively been studied and documented relevantly.3 Therefore, recent studies have elaborated either on specific polymers of practical importance like polyethylenes,52 on specific chain characteristics like semiflexible to stiff nature,53 or on multicomponent polymer systemstypicallyblockcopolymers.54Notably,moreover, theory and simulation studies have increasingly focused on multi-cyclic complex polymers, obviously promoted by synthetic developments on complex topological polymers.55–57 Unique topological polymer properties envisaged by the simulation studies are now to be verified experimentally using relevant topological polymers.

To elucidate the topology effect in the crystallization process, a defect-free ring poly(THF) was prepared together with the linear counterpart having the precisely relevant chemical structure.63 Thus, a living bifunctional poly(THF) was terminated with sodium allyloxide to give a telechelic precursor having allyl end groups. The subsequent metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC) with a Grubbs catalyst under dilution, followed by the hydrogenation of the unsaturated linking group afforded a defect-free ring poly(THF), consisting exclusively of oxytetramethylene units (Scheme 8). The isothermal crystallization experiments showed the slower crystallization rate for ring poly(THF)s ascribed to their topologically constrained conformation (Fig. 4). Moreover,', 'distinctive crystal morphologies are produced, in particular a banded structure in the spherulites exclusively for the ring poly (THF) but not for the linear counterpart. The crystallization kinetics of ring poly(3-caprolactone)s has recently been reported by several groups.64 The faster crystallization rate was observed for ring polymers than the linear counterpart in contrast to the case of poly(THF), and was ascribed to the higher diffusion of ring polymers than their linear counterparts.64', '5.Topology effects by ring polymers in self-assemblies', 'The topology effects by ring polymers could be amplified in their assembled states rather than in their individually separated forms. Therefore, micelles formed by ring polymers should be of a remarkable interest. Thus, a series of micelles were prepared with amphiphilic cyclic AB block copolymers, comprised of eitherpoly(butyleneoxide)/poly(ethyleneoxide)orpoly (propylene oxide)/poly(ethylene oxide), together with their linear AB, linear ABA block copolymer counterparts.65–67 The cyclic block copolymer employed in this study was prepared by a bimolecular process using the hydroxy-terminated linear block copolymer and dichloromethane as a linking reagent in the presence of KOH, to form an acetal linking unit (Scheme 9A).

These results are consistent with the geometric estimation of the size of the micelles, corresponding to the Nw, rt, and rh, which is dependent on the continuous chain length of the hydrophobic segment in the block copolymers. And, those in the cyclic AB and the linear ABA block copolymers are estimated as a half of that in the linear AB counterpart employed in this study. Moreover, the cyclic AB block copolymer tends to constitute a stiff hairpin-like conformation, resulting in a slightly larger hydrophobic core within the micelle compared to that with the linear ABA coun-terpart having free chain ends. The enthalpy of micellization (DmicH�) was also smaller with the cyclic AB block copolymer than that with the corresponding linear ABA counterpart, presumably because the segmental fli', 'p-flop is inhibited in the micelle with the former, in contrast to the motional freedom by the latter having free chain ends. This also agrees with the smaller entropy of micellization (DmicS�) with the cyclic AB block copolymer than with the linear counterpart. ', 'More recently, a significant topology effect has been revealed in the thermal stability of the micelle formed with cyclic AB block copolymers in comparison with the linear ABA and even with the linear AB counterparts.68 Notably, a variety of relevant cyclic lipids, thus a type of surfactants, have been discovered in the cell membrane of thermophilic archaea, single-cell microorganisms, surviving in the hostile environment of very high-temperatures located at hot springs and submarine volcanoes.69 Thus, an amphiphilic cyclic AB block copolymer, comprised of poly(butyl acrylate)/poly(ethylene oxide) segments, was prepared. The unimolecular, metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC) process was employed using a linear ABA block copolymer precursor having olefinic end groups (Scheme 9B).21', 'The obtained cyclic and the relevant linear block copolymers were allowed to form the corresponding micelles, in which their cmc’s and the number-average hydrodynamic volumes (Dh) were measured to be closely comparable to each other (Fig. 5).68 The size and morphology of the micelles with either block copolymers were directly observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 6) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 6) to show commonly flower-like spherical shapes possessing the consistent diameters determined by DLS (Scheme 10). ', 'Remarkably, the thermal stability of the micelles was drasti-cally enhanced using the cyclic block copolymer. Thus, the', 'corresponding micelle solutions were heated from 20�C in a stepwise fashion (Fig. 7), and the micelle with the linear ABA block copolymer became turbid at around 25 �C, while that with the cyclic AB counterpart was stable till above 70 �C.68', 'Based on the large deviation of the clouding point (Tc) among the micelles either solely with cyclic or with linear block copol-ymers, the tuning of the Tc of the micelle was achieved by the coassembly of both the linear and cyclic block copolymers.68', 'Thus, the Tc was systematically altered along with the relative contents of the cyclic and the linear block copolymer compo-nents in the micelle, as shown in Fig. 7.68 This topology effect will be utilized to design temperature-responsive devices encapsu-lating and releasing appropriate components in and from the micelle.

A number of recent studies are presented in this section, covering a diverse field either by conjugated cyclic oligomers,70 by photo-responsive ring polymers,71,72 by biodegradable ring polyesters,14', 'by temperature-responsive ring polymers,12,13or by pharmaco-logically functional ring polymers.73', 'Conjugated polymers and oligomers have currently been extensively studied primarily due to their potential for diverse electronic and photonic applications.74 Ring-shaped conjugated polymers and oligomers have attracted particular interests as a prototype of the molecularly fabricated electric circuit, since the circulation of electrons/holes might be induced along the ‘‘endless’’ conjugated segments. A wide variety of conjugated ring oligomers possessing the increasing numbers of unsaturated groups have thus been prepared to test their electrochemical properties.70 Fully conjugated large ring polymers, on the other hand, have still been an elusive synthetic challenge. It is notable, moreover, that a twisted, Moebius stripe-like conjugated olig-omer has attracted considerable interests because of their unusual non-H€uckel aromaticity, in contrast to the conventional H€uckel-type aromaticity which is dependent on its planar geometry by conjugated units.75', 'Photo-response behaviors could be influenced by polymer topologies of either ring or linear forms. Thus, a ring polymer having photo-responsive azobenzene units in the main chain was prepared through the bimolecular end-to-end cyclization via click chemistry.71 Upon the irradiation of UV light, both the trans-to-cis and the cis-to-trans isomerization proceeded slightly faster by the ring polymer in comparison with the linear counterpart. This behavior was attributed to the higher topo-logical constraint of the former than the latter counterpart.71 As another example, a ring polystyrene having two photoactive groups, namely fluorene and anthracene units, was prepared through the bimolecular process using a living bifunctional polystyrene produced with an initiator having a fluorene unit and a linking reagent having an anthracene unit.72 The fluo-rescent behavior of the obtained ring polymer was subsequently studied to show the intramolecular energy migration between the two chromophores.72', 'Naturally occurring ring polymers, such as cyclic DNAs, cyclic peptides as well as cyclic polysaccharides,3 and multi-cyclic counterparts like cyclotides,76 are known to exhibit higher stability against biologically induced decomposition. In this relevance, the topology effect of aliphatic biodegradable poly-esters on their decomposition behavior has been investigated.14', 'Thus, ring poly(caprolactone) was prepared through the unim-olecular click polymer cyclization using the corresponding precursor having an azide and an alkyne group. The higher hydrolytic stability was then observed in comparison with the linear counterparts.14 Notably, moreover, such biodegradable ring polyesters by poly(valerolactone) and by poly(lactide) were also prepared.15,30,31,77', 'Temperature-responsivepropertiesofpoly(N-iso-propylacrylamide), poly(NIPAM), have extensively been studied for their eventual uses in the controlled release devices and for the cell–sheet applications.78 The two groups recently reported the topology effects by ring poly(NIPAM)s.12,13 Thus, the two groups prepared linear poly(NIPAM) precursors having alkyne and azide end groups either by a reversible addition–fragmen-tation chain transfer (RAFT) or by an atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) technique, and the unimolecular click process was commonly applied for the subsequent polymer cyclization. The cloud point (TCP) of the obtained ring poly(NIPAM) by one group was several degrees higher than that of the corresponding linear counterpart. In addition, they observed that the phase transition by the ring polymers took place distinctively slower upon heating.12 Another group, on the other hand, observed the ring poly(NIPAM) showing a few degrees lower TCP against the linear counterpart at the higher solution concentration, while higher at the lower solution concentration. Furthermore, they reported the smaller enthalpy change (DH) during the phase transition with the ring poly (NIPAM). These results were accounted for by the suppression of the hydrogen bond interaction between the ring poly(NIPAM) with water molecules due to their topological constraints in comparison with the flexible linear counterpart having free chain ends.13', 'A pharmacological application of ring polymers has recently been demonstrated by elucidating the fil', 'tration/elimination mechanism of a kidney through its nanoporous channel.73 Thus, it was anticipated that the ring polymer could remain longer in a body than the linear counterpart, since the former should be reluctant to transform its conformation into a folded shape to traverse through the nanoporous channels of the kidney.73 To test this topology effect, a series of linear and cyclic poly(capro-lactone)s having poly(ethylene glycol) graft segments and having phenolic functionalities for radiolabeling by 125I were prepared. The lower secretion into urine and in turn the higher accumu-lation in various organs was indeed confirmed with the ring polymer having an appropriate molecular weight, corresponding to its hydrodynamic volume.73 These findings may provide new design methodologies for drug carriers and imaging agents via the topology-based control of a blood circulation time.', '7.Conclusions and future perspectives', 'In this review, we have shown a variety of recent achievements in topological polymer chemistry, to focus on novel polymer', 'Fig. 7The thermal stability of the micelles solely with the linear and with the cyclic block copolymers, and also with the coassembly by both components.
