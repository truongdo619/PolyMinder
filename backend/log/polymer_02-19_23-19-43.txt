Moreover, the dilution condition should be applied to suppress the concurrent chain extension. In consequence, this bimolecular process is now', 'recognized as a less attractive choice for the preparation of cyclic polymers in practice (Scheme 1A). ', 'A significantly improved means by an alternative unimolecular process has subsequently been introduced to prepare cyclic polymers (Scheme 1B). It was first demonstrated by using an asymmetrically functional telechelic precursor, a-acetal-u-styryl polystyrene,7 and the subsequent end-to-end polymer cyclization through the deprotection/activation treatment. This unimolecular process with asymmetrically functional telechelic precursors has been extended by employing alternative pairs of the reactive groups. Thus, an a-amino-u-carboxyl polystyrene and poly(tert-butyl acrylate) were prepared through a living polymerization using an initiator having a protected amino group, followed by the end-capping reaction to introduce a carboxylic group.8 The resulting asymmetric telechelic precursor underwent, after the deprotection, an intramolecular amidation reaction to give a ring polymer product effectively. Alternatively, an a-(furan-pro-tected)-maleimide-u-cyclopentadienylpoly(methylmethacry-late) and poly(tert-butyl acrylate) were prepared through the ATRP using a protected maleimide initiator and the subsequent introduction of a cyclopentadienyl group at the living end with the nickelocene methodology.9 The obtained asymmetric tele-chelic precursor was subjected to the heat treatment to cause the spontaneous deprotection followed by an intramolecular Diels–Alder addition reaction to give a ring polymer product effectively.9 It is notable, however, that these processes using telechelic precursors having potentially reactive groups require multistep protection/deprotection treatments. ', 'A versatile unimolecular process has recently been introduced by employing a click reaction using asymmetrically functional telechelic polystyrene having an alkyne and an azide group.10 The introduction of these two functional groups at the polymer chain-ends could be performed conveniently, and they can react with each other upon the addition of a Cu catalyst.11 Therefore, this click polymer cyclization has been applied to prepare such functional ring polymers, as poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide)12,13', 'and poly(caprolactone)14 as well as poly(valerolactone)15 to elucidate their topology-effect on phase transition, and on biodegradation, respectively, detailed in the later section.

The subsequent metathesis condensation, i.e., metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC), in the presence of a Grubbs catalyst pro-ceeded effectively to give the corresponding ring polymers in high yields even under dilution.18–20 This MPC process has further been applied for the practical synthesis of amphiphilic cyclic', 'Scheme 1Ring polymer synthesis by (A) a bimolecular process, (B) a unimolecular process with asymmetric telechelics, (C) a unimolecular process with symmetric telechelics, (D) a ring-expansion polymerization process and (E) an electrostatic self-assembly and covalent fixation (ESA-CF) process.', 'This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011Polym.

This process does not require dilution in contrast to the end-to-end polymer cyclization process by linear polymer precursors, while a reactive initiator fragment is inherently included in the final ring polymer structure. Thus until recently, the ring-expansion process has been considered as a less practical means, since it is not an easy task to maintain the ring topology of the product while eliminating the initiator residues.26', 'A number of new processes have recently been developed to address this problem in the ring-expansion polymerization (Scheme 2). Thus, a new Ru catalyst bearing a cyclic ligand containing the Ru-alkylidene unit has been introduced and applied for the ring-expansion polymerization of cyclic olefins such as 1,5-cyclooctadiene or cyclooctene.27 During the chain-growth process, the chain transfer to the Ru-alkylidene unit took place to eliminate the initiator complex, and consequently a ring polybutadiene or a ring poly(cyclooctene) free of the catalyst fragment, respectively, is produced. The obtained ring poly(cyclooctene)wasthenhydrogenatedtogivearing polyethylene, showing distinctive properties in comparison with commercial linear polyethylenes (Scheme 2A).27,28 It is notable,', 'at the same time, that the random nature of this chain transfer process inherently causes the broadening of the molecular weight distribution of the product. This process has now been applied with a bulky, dendronized monomer to construct a ring nano-object directly observable by atomic force microscopy (AFM).29', 'More recently, a new N-heterocyclic carbene initiator was introduced for the ring-expansion polymerization of lactones or lactide to form ring polyesters or polylactide, respectively (Scheme 2B).30,31 Remarkably, the obtained ring polymers possess narrow molecular weight distributions through the elimination of the initiator fragment after the quantitative consumption of the monomer, in contrast to the metathesis ring-expansion process shown before.28 By exploiting the living character, this technique has subsequently been applied for the synthesis of ring block polypeptoids and of complex topological polymers having a ring with many branches, i.e., jellyfish poly-mers.32,33 A further development of the ring-expansion process would provide a wider variety of chemical structures in ring polymers by broadening the choice of monomer types. ', 'The combination of the classical ring-expansion polymeriza-tion process, in which the initiator fragment is included within the ring polymer structure, with the end-to-end polymer cycli-zation process could provide a new effective means for ring polymers having, in particular, large sizes (Scheme 2C).34 Thus, a ring poly(caprolactone) having short photocrosslinkable block segments was prepared through a sequential living ring-expan-sion polymerization using a cyclic stannate initiator. The subsequent irradiation under dilution caused the intramolecular covalent linking of the two short segments.

It is remarkable, moreover, that a small portion of nanoobjects corresponding to complex ring polymers having tadpole, 8-shaped, catenated and knotted forms were also identified. This showed, for the first time, that not only single-cyclic but also various complex cyclic polymer topologies are indeed produced through the polymer cyclization process, as previously shown in DNA systems.37', 'An electrostatic self-assembly and covalent fixation (ESA-CF) process has been introduced for the effective synthesis of not only cyclic but also functionalized cyclic and multicyclic polymers, where linear or star telechelic polymers having cyclic ammonium salt groups accompanying small or polymeric plurifunctional carboxylate counteranions are employed as key precursors (Scheme 1E).38–40 Various telechelic polymers have been conve-niently prepared through the relevant living polymerization fol-lowed by the end-capping/end-conversion technique. The choice of such particular types of cyclic ammonium salt end groups as five- and six-membered cyclic ammonium, i.e., N-phenyl-pyrrolidinium and N-phenylpiperidinium salt groups, respec-tively, is of a crucial importance in the ESA-CF process (Scheme 3).41 The former undergoes upon heating a selective ring-opening reaction by a carboxylate counteranion to form an amino ester group through the nucleophilic attack exclusively at the N-adjacent ring (endo) position. On the other hand, the latter having unstrained six-membered cyclic ammonium salt groups gives a chemically more stable, simple ester group through the nucleophilic attack at the alternative N-adjacent (exo) position, to eliminate N-phenylpiperidine. ', 'And in the electrostatic polymer self-assembly, the cations at the end of the telechelics and the anions in the carboxylates counteranions always balance the charges. Upon the dilution, the self-assembly tends to dissociate into one having the smallest number of polymer components by keeping the balance of the charges (Scheme 4). Thus, when a self-assembly comprised of', 'a linear telechelic precursor, typically poly(THF), having cyclic ammonium salt groups accompanying either a dicarboxylate or a tetracarboxylate counteranion was heated at dilution, the selective ring-opening reaction of the cyclic ammonium groups took place to produce single-cyclic (ring) or dicyclic (8-shaped) polymerproducts,respectively,inhighyields.38,42Ring poly(THF)s having the molecular weights of up to 10 000, cor-responding to the ring size of as high as 700 atoms, were obtainable and characterized unequivocally by the MALDI-TOF mass technique. Furthermore, the ESA-CF process with dynamic equilibrium nature has been exploited to construct various multicyclic as well as cyclic-linear hybrid polymer topologies (Scheme 5).6', 'Moreover, ring polymers possessing the prescribed functional groups at the designated positions, i.e., kyklo-telechelics and cyclic macromonomer, have also been prepared by employing telechelic precursors possessing such functional groups as hydroxyl, olefinic, acetylenic, and azide groups at the designated, typically a center, position by using the relevant initiator, or by introducing functional linking reagents.43 They were subse-quently applied to construct more complex polymer topologies either through the covalent linkage or even through the non-covalent, mechanical linkage uniquely formed by threading with ring polymer units.44,45 It was also shown that network polymers formed from cyclic polymer precursors exhibited unique gel properties compared with conventional gels obtained with linear/ branched polymer precursors.46 Moreover, the topological conversion of polymers between ring/linear and even between single-cyclic/dicyclic topologies has now been achieved.45,47,48', 'By the combination of the ESA-CF protocol with selective covalent linking chemistry, a wide variety of multi-cyclic as well as cyclic-linear conjugated polymers have been synthesized.49 In particular, the combination of the ESA-CF process with the metathesis condensation and with the click process has now been revealed as a versatile means to construct a variety of complex multicyclic polymer topologies of fused-, spiro- and bridged forms (Scheme 6).50 Both the functional ring polymer precursors and thecovalentlylinkedmulticyclicpolymerproductwere unequivocally characterized by means of a series of spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques including MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy and SEC. As shown in Fig. 1, for a typical example, the structure of the polymer products having complex multicyclic topologies is convincingly demonstrated.

Thus, the Tg of ring polymers is higher than the linear counter-part, until the polymer chain length becomes long enough to diminish the contribution of the chain end. On the contrary, the hydrodynamic volume or the melt viscosity of ring polymers is inherently smaller than their linear counterparts irrespective of their chain lengths. This indicates the distinctive conception in the topology effect by ring polymers. The latter is regarded as an inherent topology effect by ring polymers, while the former as the depletion effect of the polymer chain ends. Nevertheless, the elimination of the chain ends of polymer molecules inevitably leads to the formation of cyclic constructions to bring the topology effect, now drawing increasing interests to discover unusual properties and functions in polymer materials covering mechanical, thermal, electric, photonic and bio-related applica-tions either in bulk or at surface. From an experimental point of', 'view, moreover, further developments are awaited to provide ring polymers possessing high molecular weights with guaran-teed purity, since the mixing of even small amount of linear counterpartmightcauseinconclusiveorevenerroneous conclusions on the topology effect by ring polymers.', '4.Topology effects on basic polymer properties: ', 'simulations and experiments from simple to complex cyclic polymers', 'Basic characteristics of single-cyclic (ring) homopolymers either in solution or bulk, in static or dynamic states, have extensively been studied and documented relevantly.3 Therefore, recent studies have elaborated either on specific polymers of practical importance like polyethylenes,52 on specific chain characteristics like semiflexible to stiff nature,53 or on multicomponent polymer systemstypicallyblockcopolymers.54Notably,moreover, theory and simulation studies have increasingly focused on multi-cyclic complex polymers, obviously promoted by synthetic developments on complex topological polymers.55–57 Unique topological polymer properties envisaged by the simulation studies are now to be verified experimentally using relevant topological polymers.

The subsequent metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC) with a Grubbs catalyst under dilution, followed by the hydrogenation of the unsaturated linking group afforded a defect-free ring poly(THF), consisting exclusively of oxytetramethylene units (Scheme 8). The isothermal crystallization experiments showed the slower crystallization rate for ring poly(THF)s ascribed to their topologically constrained conformation (Fig. 4). Moreover,', 'distinctive crystal morphologies are produced, in particular a banded structure in the spherulites exclusively for the ring poly (THF) but not for the linear counterpart. The crystallization kinetics of ring poly(3-caprolactone)s has recently been reported by several groups.64 The faster crystallization rate was observed for ring polymers than the linear counterpart in contrast to the case of poly(THF), and was ascribed to the higher diffusion of ring polymers than their linear counterparts.64', '5.Topology effects by ring polymers in self-assemblies', 'The topology effects by ring polymers could be amplified in their assembled states rather than in their individually separated forms. Therefore, micelles formed by ring polymers should be of a remarkable interest. Thus, a series of micelles were prepared with amphiphilic cyclic AB block copolymers, comprised of eitherpoly(butyleneoxide)/poly(ethyleneoxide)orpoly (propylene oxide)/poly(ethylene oxide), together with their linear AB, linear ABA block copolymer counterparts.65–67 The cyclic block copolymer employed in this study was prepared by a bimolecular process using the hydroxy-terminated linear block copolymer and dichloromethane as a linking reagent in the presence of KOH, to form an acetal linking unit (Scheme 9A).

These results are consistent with the geometric estimation of the size of the micelles, corresponding to the Nw, rt, and rh, which is dependent on the continuous chain length of the hydrophobic segment in the block copolymers. And, those in the cyclic AB and the linear ABA block copolymers are estimated as a half of that in the linear AB counterpart employed in this study. Moreover, the cyclic AB block copolymer tends to constitute a stiff hairpin-like conformation, resulting in a slightly larger hydrophobic core within the micelle compared to that with the linear ABA coun-terpart having free chain ends. The enthalpy of micellization (DmicH�) was also smaller with the cyclic AB block copolymer than that with the corresponding linear ABA counterpart, presumably because the segmental fli', 'p-flop is inhibited in the micelle with the former, in contrast to the motional freedom by the latter having free chain ends. This also agrees with the smaller entropy of micellization (DmicS�) with the cyclic AB block copolymer than with the linear counterpart. ', 'More recently, a significant topology effect has been revealed in the thermal stability of the micelle formed with cyclic AB block copolymers in comparison with the linear ABA and even with the linear AB counterparts.68 Notably, a variety of relevant cyclic lipids, thus a type of surfactants, have been discovered in the cell membrane of thermophilic archaea, single-cell microorganisms, surviving in the hostile environment of very high-temperatures located at hot springs and submarine volcanoes.69 Thus, an amphiphilic cyclic AB block copolymer, comprised of poly(butyl acrylate)/poly(ethylene oxide) segments, was prepared. The unimolecular, metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC) process was employed using a linear ABA block copolymer precursor having olefinic end groups (Scheme 9B).21', 'The obtained cyclic and the relevant linear block copolymers were allowed to form the corresponding micelles, in which their cmc’s and the number-average hydrodynamic volumes (Dh) were measured to be closely comparable to each other (Fig. 5).68 The size and morphology of the micelles with either block copolymers were directly observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 6) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 6) to show commonly flower-like spherical shapes possessing the consistent diameters determined by DLS (Scheme 10). ', 'Remarkably, the thermal stability of the micelles was drasti-cally enhanced using the cyclic block copolymer. Thus, the', 'corresponding micelle solutions were heated from 20�C in a stepwise fashion (Fig. 7), and the micelle with the linear ABA block copolymer became turbid at around 25 �C, while that with the cyclic AB counterpart was stable till above 70 �C.68', 'Based on the large deviation of the clouding point (Tc) among the micelles either solely with cyclic or with linear block copol-ymers, the tuning of the Tc of the micelle was achieved by the coassembly of both the linear and cyclic block copolymers.68', 'Thus, the Tc was systematically altered along with the relative contents of the cyclic and the linear block copolymer compo-nents in the micelle, as shown in Fig. 7.68 This topology effect will be utilized to design temperature-responsive devices encapsu-lating and releasing appropriate components in and from the micelle.

A number of recent studies are presented in this section, covering a diverse field either by conjugated cyclic oligomers,70 by photo-responsive ring polymers,71,72 by biodegradable ring polyesters,14', 'by temperature-responsive ring polymers,12,13or by pharmaco-logically functional ring polymers.73', 'Conjugated polymers and oligomers have currently been extensively studied primarily due to their potential for diverse electronic and photonic applications.74 Ring-shaped conjugated polymers and oligomers have attracted particular interests as a prototype of the molecularly fabricated electric circuit, since the circulation of electrons/holes might be induced along the ‘‘endless’’ conjugated segments. A wide variety of conjugated ring oligomers possessing the increasing numbers of unsaturated groups have thus been prepared to test their electrochemical properties.70 Fully conjugated large ring polymers, on the other hand, have still been an elusive synthetic challenge. It is notable, moreover, that a twisted, Moebius stripe-like conjugated olig-omer has attracted considerable interests because of their unusual non-H€uckel aromaticity, in contrast to the conventional H€uckel-type aromaticity which is dependent on its planar geometry by conjugated units.75', 'Photo-response behaviors could be influenced by polymer topologies of either ring or linear forms. Thus, a ring polymer having photo-responsive azobenzene units in the main chain was prepared through the bimolecular end-to-end cyclization via click chemistry.71 Upon the irradiation of UV light, both the trans-to-cis and the cis-to-trans isomerization proceeded slightly faster by the ring polymer in comparison with the linear counterpart. This behavior was attributed to the higher topo-logical constraint of the former than the latter counterpart.71 As another example, a ring polystyrene having two photoactive groups, namely fluorene and anthracene units, was prepared through the bimolecular process using a living bifunctional polystyrene produced with an initiator having a fluorene unit and a linking reagent having an anthracene unit.72 The fluo-rescent behavior of the obtained ring polymer was subsequently studied to show the intramolecular energy migration between the two chromophores.72', 'Naturally occurring ring polymers, such as cyclic DNAs, cyclic peptides as well as cyclic polysaccharides,3 and multi-cyclic counterparts like cyclotides,76 are known to exhibit higher stability against biologically induced decomposition. In this relevance, the topology effect of aliphatic biodegradable poly-esters on their decomposition behavior has been investigated.14', 'Thus, ring poly(caprolactone) was prepared through the unim-olecular click polymer cyclization using the corresponding precursor having an azide and an alkyne group. The higher hydrolytic stability was then observed in comparison with the linear counterparts.14 Notably, moreover, such biodegradable ring polyesters by poly(valerolactone) and by poly(lactide) were also prepared.15,30,31,77', 'Temperature-responsivepropertiesofpoly(N-iso-propylacrylamide), poly(NIPAM), have extensively been studied for their eventual uses in the controlled release devices and for the cell–sheet applications.78 The two groups recently reported the topology effects by ring poly(NIPAM)s.12,13 Thus, the two groups prepared linear poly(NIPAM) precursors having alkyne and azide end groups either by a reversible addition–fragmen-tation chain transfer (RAFT) or by an atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) technique, and the unimolecular click process was commonly applied for the subsequent polymer cyclization. The cloud point (TCP) of the obtained ring poly(NIPAM) by one group was several degrees higher than that of the corresponding linear counterpart. In addition, they observed that the phase transition by the ring polymers took place distinctively slower upon heating.12 Another group, on the other hand, observed the ring poly(NIPAM) showing a few degrees lower TCP against the linear counterpart at the higher solution concentration, while higher at the lower solution concentration. Furthermore, they reported the smaller enthalpy change (DH) during the phase transition with the ring poly (NIPAM). These results were accounted for by the suppression of the hydrogen bond interaction between the ring poly(NIPAM) with water molecules due to their topological constraints in comparison with the flexible linear counterpart having free chain ends.13', 'A pharmacological application of ring polymers has recently been demonstrated by elucidating the fil', 'tration/elimination mechanism of a kidney through its nanoporous channel.73 Thus, it was anticipated that the ring polymer could remain longer in a body than the linear counterpart, since the former should be reluctant to transform its conformation into a folded shape to traverse through the nanoporous channels of the kidney.73 To test this topology effect, a series of linear and cyclic poly(capro-lactone)s having poly(ethylene glycol) graft segments and having phenolic functionalities for radiolabeling by 125I were prepared. The lower secretion into urine and in turn the higher accumu-lation in various organs was indeed confirmed with the ring polymer having an appropriate molecular weight, corresponding to its hydrodynamic volume.73 These findings may provide new design methodologies for drug carriers and imaging agents via the topology-based control of a blood circulation time.', '7.Conclusions and future perspectives', 'In this review, we have shown a variety of recent achievements in topological polymer chemistry, to focus on novel polymer', 'Fig. 7The thermal stability of the micelles solely with the linear and with the cyclic block copolymers, and also with the coassembly by both components.

', 'Commonly used approaches for fabricating polymer-based micellar carriers utilize block copolymers, which assemble into nanosized aggregates in aqueous media and thus encap-sulate the hydrophobic drugs in their interior. Although the past years have seen remarkable advances in the synthesis of block copolymers, their synthesis is still not trivial. Instead of using a hydrophobic second block, we envisioned employing a host moiety to encapsulate the hydrophobic drug and increase hydrophobic interactions leading to micellar aggregates. For this purpose, beta-cyclodextrin (β-CD), a cyclic oligosaccharide composed of glucose units, emerges as a viable candidate. It is well established that β-CD is a valuable excipient for enhancing the solubility and bioavailability of hydrophobic drugs.11–14', 'Previous studies have demonstrated β-CD’s utility in enhan-cing curcumin’s solubility and stability, making it an ideal candidate for formulating curcumin-based therapeutics.14–21', 'However, most of these studies solubilize curcumin in mole-cular form. Thus, the size of the complex usually falls much below the domain of nanosize necessary for drug delivery with passive targeting mediated by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.22 Apart from using CDs in molecular form, a variety of macromolecular constructs with CDs have been reported,23–25 To date, the CD moiety has been conju-gated to the chain end,26,27 as side chain residues,28 or utilized as a core motif in star-like multiarm polymers.29 In most cases, the CD moiety is non-reversibly conjugated to the poly-meric scaffolds, and thus, the encapsulated guest molecule is releasedpredominantlybyreversiblehost–guest interactions.30,31 In this study, we aimed for conjugation with a disulfide-based reversible linkage so that the encapsulated hydrophobic guest molecule remains soluble upon release from the polymer-based aggregate. ', 'In recent years, it has been established that the incorpor-ation of redox-responsive linkage in the drug delivery platform further enhances the cytotoxicity in cancerous cells with increased levels of glutathione (GSH).32–39 Thus, we targeted constructing a hydrophilic polymer containing a chain end β-CD unit linked with a redox-responsive linker. To obtain such a polymer in a modular fashion, we envisioned that a thiol–disulfide exchange using a benzothiazole disulfide (BDS) chain-terminated polymer could be utilized. The BDS group is known to undergo the thiol–disulfide exchange reaction with high effi', 'ciency, and we recently employed it for the functionali-zation of side chain residues of polymers, polymer-coated sur-faces and hydrogels.40–44 Until now, the usage of the BDS group as a thiol-reactive group on a polymer chain end has remained unexplored. The present work demonstrates the ver-satility of polymers containing the BDS group as a chain end moiety, along with demonstrating their utilization for obtain-ing β-CD-terminated polymers. ', 'Herein, we aimed to fabricate curcumin-loaded micellar nanoparticles using a redox-responsive polymeric construct in', 'which the CD moiety is linked to the end of the polymer chain through a redox-responsive disulfide linkage (Scheme 1). We employed a BDS-based linker at the chain end of a PEG-based hydrophilic polymer to obtain such constructs in a modular fashion. We report here the synthesis and functionalization of BDS group terminated polymers and show that the CD moiety could be effi', 'ciently added to the polymer chain end through a redox-responsive disulfide linkage. Thus the obtained β-CD-containing polymers are used to fabricate drug-loaded aggre-gates upon complexation with curcumin. It is also demon-strated that peptide-based cell targeting groups can be incor-porated at the other chain end of the β-CD-containing polymer. Drug loading and release studies, as well as cyto-toxicity and cellular internalization studies, suggest these poly-mers as promising candidates for the delivery of curcumin. Although the study here is undertaken with curcumin, one could expect that the modular approach reported here could be adapted for the delivery of other hydrophobic drugs to can-cerous cells in a targeted fashion.', 'Experimental section', 'Materials', 'Poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMEMA, Mn = 300 gmol−1) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used after purification through activated aluminum oxide filtration.

Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang-', '∗Corresponding author.

Proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PSV-modified nanoparticles shows significant increase in comparison to PVI-modified ones in low temperature and high rel-ative humidity. But in high temperature and low relative humidity, proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PVI-modified nanoparticles is observed to be more than PSV-modified ones and even at 145 ◦C the proton conductivity of PPBI/SiO2-PVI 15% is more than PPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%. The exis-tence of modified nanoparticles in PPBI nanocomposite membranes results in high proton conductivity in three ways:', '1) With increase in water uptake ', '2) With increase in the amount of doping level and ', '3) With increase in the number of proton conductive functional ', 'groups such as sulfonic acid group.', 'In PSV-modified nanocomposite membranes, acid doping decreases while the water uptake and the number of sulfonic acid groups shows an increase. Consequently, high proton conductiv-ity can be a result of these changes. It should be mentioned that in temperatures higher than 100 ◦C and in very low relative humidity, water uptake of PSV-modified membranes decreases which leads to low efficiency of the sulfonic groups attached onto the surface of the nanoparticles which in turn results in a decrease in proton conduc-tivity in both membranes, but the increase in proton conductivity resulting from high doping level is significant and also the proton conductivity of PVI-modified nanocomposite membranes increase in high temperatures. ', 'It is noteworthy that Nafion® 117 shows relatively low pro-ton conductivities under anhydrous conditions and almost lacks its proton conductivities at high temperatures. Comparing to Nafion®', '117 membranes, the high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicate that this membrane could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', '3.5. Mechanical properties', 'The mechanical properties of the PPBI-based membranes were measured. The stress–strain curves are shown in Fig. 14. Pristine', 'PPBI membrane showed an elongation at break of 38%. Mod-ification of nanocomposites with SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles results in an increase in the tensile strengths and a subse-quent decrease in the elongations at break for the PPBI-based membranes. For PPBI/modified nanoparticles nanocomposites membranes (PPBI/modified nanocomposite consists of the PPBI and surface-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles by PVI and PSV chains and PPBI/unmodified nanocomposite includes PPBI and SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles without any treatment), the presence of ionic linkages between PPBI and silica particles can be assigned to their high Young’s modulus. Introduction of modified and un-modified nanoparticles increases the brittleness of the nanocomposite mem-branes with a decrease in their elongations at break. The effects of modified and unmodified nanoparticles on the elongations at break of the nanocomposite membranes were different. The decrease in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness were widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inorganic reinforcement [37–39]. Moreover, the ionic linkages in nanocomposite membranes prepared from modi-fied nanoparticles are higher than hydrogen bonding in PPBI/SiO2and PPBI/TiO2.', 'Fig. 14. Stress–strain curves of PPBI and nanocomposite membranes containing 10% nanoparticles.', 'H. Namazi, H. Ahmadi / Journal of Power Sources 196 (2011) 2573–25832581', 'Fig. 15. The SEM photograph of a) pure PPBI membrane and TiO2-PSV nanocomposite membranes containing of b) 5%, c) 10% and d) 15% nanoparticles.', 'The brittleness of PPBI/TiO2 based nanocomposite membranes is higher than PPBI/SiO2 ones. The brittleness of membranes pre-pared from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI are less than PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV membranes which are perhaps due to more com-patibility of PVI grafted chains onto the nanoparticles surface with PPBI backbone. ', 'Comparing the brittleness of the nanocomposite membranes of the PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/SiO2-PVI with PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, respectively indicates that the brittleness of the membranes prepared with modified SiO2 nanoparticles is less than the modified TiO2 ones.', '3.6. Morphological analysis', 'The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photographs of the PPBI/TiO2-PSV nanocomposite membranes surface with various amounts of TiO2-PSV are shown in Fig. 15. ', 'A relatively flat surface is observed for thin membranes of pure PPBI (Fig. 15(a)). Fig. 15(b–d) display surface morphological properties of nanocomposite membranes having 5, 10 and 15% of TiO2-PSV, respectively. ', 'As seen in Fig. 15, TiO2-PSV nanoparticles are dispersed homo-geneously in PPBI matrixes and are increased with increasing of the percentage of TiO2-PSV nanoparticles. Also the major amounts of nanoparticles size are in the range of nanoscale and the bigger parti-cles as evidence for the formation of aggregations are not observed.', 'The size of the TiO2-PSV particles are about 25–40 nm and the size of particles on the surface of the nanocomposite are determined to be 30–60 nm.', 'Fig. 16(a) shows the SEM micrographs of the modified SiO2nanoparticles. If the interactions between silica nanoparticles are stronger than that of between PPBI molecules and silica nanoparticles, the silica nanoparticles are agglomerated together to form silica domains in micrometer sizes. The compatibility between PPBI and unmodified nanoparticles and the homogene-ity of the PPBI/SiO2 or PPBI/TiO2 membranes are somewhat poor [32]. ', 'However, the dispersion homogeneity of silica nanoparticles in PPBI membranes could be significantly improved with using surface modified nanoparticles as the additives. As shown in Fig. 16(b), the dispersion homogeneity of modified nanoparticles is observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2 nanocomposite membrane, which demonstrates high compatibility between PPBI polymer and PSV-SiO2 nanoparticles and the high dispersion abil-ity of PSV-SiO2 in PPBI matrix. Particle agglomeration is still not observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2-10%. The ionic linkages between PPBI and modified nanoparticles are contributed to their higher compatibility [32]. However, in nanocompos-ite membranes prepared from un-modified SiO2 nanoparticles, thedispersionofthenanoparticlesinpolymermatrixis not homogenous and probably aggregation has been formed (Fig. 16(c)).', '2582H. Namazi, H. Ahmadi / Journal of Power Sources 196 (2011) 2573–2583', 'Fig. 16. SEM micrograph of SiO2-PSV (a); TEM micrographs of PPBI/SiO2-PSV-10% (b); and PPBI/SiO2-10% (c).', '4. Conclusion', 'The nanocomposite PPBI-based membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified and un-modified TiO2 and SiO2nanoparticles. The thermal stability of the prepared nanocompos-', 'ite membranes was similar to PPBI membrane. The water uptake of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from TiO2/PSV and SiO2/PSV nanoparticles were higher than other nanocomposite membranes. The acid doping level and proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes in dry conditions obtained from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI nanoparticles were the highest in comparison to PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV. Formation of nanocomposites with modified and un-modified nanoparticles resulted the increas-ing of tensile strengths. The decreasing in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness was widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inor-ganic reinforcement. The high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicated that this membrane could be utilized as a proton exchange membrane for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. M.-G.

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25�C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 �C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 �10�4 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 �0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 �C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 �C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by significant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of �4 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers. ', '�2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through proton', 'exchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Nafion�as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18].

Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang-', '∗Corresponding author.

The effect of sulfonic acid groups of PSV chains grafted onto the nanoparticle surface on the water uptake is more than imidazole groups in PVI chains due to the higher hygroscopic properties of PSV comparing to PVI chains grafted on to the silica nanopar-ticle surface. The water uptake of PPBI/SiO2-PSV is higher than PPBI/TiO2-PSV which can be due to the further increase of the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles in comparison to TiO2 nanoparticle surface. ', 'The PPBI-based membranes were doped with 85% H3PO4 to prepare the acid-doped membranes. Fig. 9 shows the acid-doping levels of the PPBI-based nanocomposite membranes. Acid-doping level (H3PO4 molecules per PPBI repeating unit) of pristine PPBI membrane was 13.5, which decreased to 11.8 for PPBI/SiO2, 12.0 for PPBI/SiO2-PSV, 11.7 for PPBI/TiO2 and 12.2 for PPBI/TiO2-PSV', 'Fig. 9.

Some of the amino groups in PPBI chains were blocked with the sulfonic acid groups of TiO2-PSV and SiO2-PSV, to decrease the binding ability of PPBI chains to H3PO4molecules. ', 'Among the prepared nanocomposites, the water uptake in PPBI/SiO2-PSV and acid doping in PPBI/SiO2-PVI were the most one. Even in the comparison of these membranes with the simi-lar ones which prepared from modified TiO2 such as PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, the amount of water uptake and doping level were higher. This shows that using modified SiO2 nanoparticles in fuel cells is more appropriate.', '3.4. Proton conductivity', 'The membrane was sandwiched between two stainless steel electrodes and pressed together by clamp. Then, the MEA (Mem-brane Electrolyte Assembly) was inputted in the steam autoclave equipped with temperature controller. For measurement of pro-ton conductivity, the steam autoclave supplied with steam from a house generator for exposure to saturated steam at desired temperature. As an example, for saturated steam the pressure cor-responding to 120 ◦C is 205 kPa. The time of exposure to saturated steam at 120 ◦C was 30 min that this value for temperature of 140 ◦C was increased to 50 min.', 'Fig. 10 shows the Nyquist plot and equivalent circuit of studied membranes at 25 ◦C and RH 100% for some membranes. ', 'After fitting the EIS experimental data on the electrical equiv-alent circuit, the membrane proton conductivity was determined from the intercept of EIS data with real impedance Z′ axis (as the value of Rm element). In equivalent circuit, Rm presents the resis-tance of the polymer film between the two metallic electrodes toward charge carriers (i.e. H+). L1 presents the stray inductance of the setup wires. CPE1 presents the non-ideal double layer capac-itance of the film/metal electrode interface. Rct and W0 show the charge transfer resistance of the (possible) reactions at the film/metal electrode interface and the diffusion processes through the polymers film, respectively. The proton conductivities of the phosphoric acid-doped PPBI based nanocomposite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 11) at 100% relative humidity were presented as a function of temperatures up to 80 ◦C. The pro-ton conductivities of all membranes increased with increasing the operation temperature up to 80 ◦C. Addition of the un-modified nanoparticles showed a negative effect on the proton conductivities of nanocomposite membranes. Similar trends were also reported to', 'H. Namazi, H.

', 'On the other hand, comparing the pristine PPBI and Nafion®', '117 membranes, the relatively high proton conductivities of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles are noteworthy [32]. Li et al. have used sulfonated organosilica to modify Nafion® membranes and they found that the proton con-ductivities of the modified membranes were still lower than that of the neat Nafion® membrane. ', 'The reduction in the proton conductivity was attributed to the silica-induced changes in the tortuous paths and in the dis-tribution of hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains. However, in this work an enhancing effect on the proton conductivity was observed with addition of PSV and PVI grafted nanoparticles to PPBI mem-brane. The sulfonic and imidazole groups of modified nanoparticles also contribute in the acid-doping effect to PPBI polymer so as to enhance the proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles. Moreover, the presence of modified nanoparticles induces proton conductive pathways lead-ing to an increase in the proton conductivities of PPBI/modified nanoparticles membranes [24].

Proton conductivities of PPBI based nanocomposite membranes containing SiO2 (a) and TiO2 (b) nanoparticles at dry environment up to 145 ◦C.', 'studied at high temperatures under an anhydrous environment. All the PPBI/modified nanoparticle membranes still exhibited higher proton conductivities than the pristine acid-doped PPBI membrane. ', 'Generally, two principle mechanisms of vehicle mechanism and Grotthuss mechanism (hopping) describe proton diffusion through the membrane [33]. It is possible that the bounded water par-ticipates by the Grotthuss mechanism, and the free water takes part mostly by vehicle mechanism [34]. Addition of silica-SO3H to the membranes increases the bounded water content in the membranes (Fig. 13). The bounded water facilitates the proton transport ability through the Grotthuss mechanism, originating by generation of a continuous proton conductive pathway. There-fore, the high proton conductivity of PPBI/modified nanoparticles can be attributed to the high bounded water content in the membrane. ', 'Since the Grotthuss-type diffusion mechanism without assis-tance of the vehicle mechanism has been proposed for the protonconductionunderanhydrousenvironments[35,36], theprotonconductivityoftheacid-dopedPPBI/modified nanoparticlemembranescouldbesynergisticallyresulted from their modified nanoparticle contents and the acid-doping levels.

Also, according to Fig. 8, water uptake of the membrane shows an increase when using higher amounts of modified nanoparticles. This increase in PSV-modified nanocomposite membranesishigherinPVI-modified one. Proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PSV-modified nanoparticles shows significant increase in comparison to PVI-modified ones in low temperature and high rel-ative humidity. But in high temperature and low relative humidity, proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PVI-modified nanoparticles is observed to be more than PSV-modified ones and even at 145 ◦C the proton conductivity of PPBI/SiO2-PVI 15% is more than PPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%. The exis-tence of modified nanoparticles in PPBI nanocomposite membranes results in high proton conductivity in three ways:', '1) With increase in water uptake ', '2) With increase in the amount of doping level and ', '3) With increase in the number of proton conductive functional ', 'groups such as sulfonic acid group.', 'In PSV-modified nanocomposite membranes, acid doping decreases while the water uptake and the number of sulfonic acid groups shows an increase. Consequently, high proton conductiv-ity can be a result of these changes. It should be mentioned that in temperatures higher than 100 ◦C and in very low relative humidity, water uptake of PSV-modified membranes decreases which leads to low efficiency of the sulfonic groups attached onto the surface of the nanoparticles which in turn results in a decrease in proton conduc-tivity in both membranes, but the increase in proton conductivity resulting from high doping level is significant and also the proton conductivity of PVI-modified nanocomposite membranes increase in high temperatures. ', 'It is noteworthy that Nafion® 117 shows relatively low pro-ton conductivities under anhydrous conditions and almost lacks its proton conductivities at high temperatures. Comparing to Nafion®', '117 membranes, the high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicate that this membrane could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', '3.5. Mechanical properties', 'The mechanical properties of the PPBI-based membranes were measured. The stress–strain curves are shown in Fig. 14. Pristine', 'PPBI membrane showed an elongation at break of 38%. Mod-ification of nanocomposites with SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles results in an increase in the tensile strengths and a subse-quent decrease in the elongations at break for the PPBI-based membranes. For PPBI/modified nanoparticles nanocomposites membranes (PPBI/modified nanocomposite consists of the PPBI and surface-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles by PVI and PSV chains and PPBI/unmodified nanocomposite includes PPBI and SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles without any treatment), the presence of ionic linkages between PPBI and silica particles can be assigned to their high Young’s modulus. Introduction of modified and un-modified nanoparticles increases the brittleness of the nanocomposite mem-branes with a decrease in their elongations at break. The effects of modified and unmodified nanoparticles on the elongations at break of the nanocomposite membranes were different. The decrease in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness were widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inorganic reinforcement [37–39]. Moreover, the ionic linkages in nanocomposite membranes prepared from modi-fied nanoparticles are higher than hydrogen bonding in PPBI/SiO2and PPBI/TiO2.', 'Fig. 14.

The brittleness of membranes pre-pared from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI are less than PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV membranes which are perhaps due to more com-patibility of PVI grafted chains onto the nanoparticles surface with PPBI backbone. ', 'Comparing the brittleness of the nanocomposite membranes of the PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/SiO2-PVI with PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, respectively indicates that the brittleness of the membranes prepared with modified SiO2 nanoparticles is less than the modified TiO2 ones.', '3.6.

If the interactions between silica nanoparticles are stronger than that of between PPBI molecules and silica nanoparticles, the silica nanoparticles are agglomerated together to form silica domains in micrometer sizes. The compatibility between PPBI and unmodified nanoparticles and the homogene-ity of the PPBI/SiO2 or PPBI/TiO2 membranes are somewhat poor [32].

As shown in Fig. 16(b), the dispersion homogeneity of modified nanoparticles is observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2 nanocomposite membrane, which demonstrates high compatibility between PPBI polymer and PSV-SiO2 nanoparticles and the high dispersion abil-ity of PSV-SiO2 in PPBI matrix. Particle agglomeration is still not observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2-10%. The ionic linkages between PPBI and modified nanoparticles are contributed to their higher compatibility [32].

Conclusion', 'The nanocomposite PPBI-based membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified and un-modified TiO2 and SiO2nanoparticles.

The acid doping level and proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes in dry conditions obtained from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI nanoparticles were the highest in comparison to PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV. Formation of nanocomposites with modified and un-modified nanoparticles resulted the increas-ing of tensile strengths. The decreasing in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness was widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inor-ganic reinforcement. The high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicated that this membrane could be utilized as a proton exchange membrane for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. M.-G.

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25�C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 �C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 �10�4 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 �0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 �C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 �C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by significant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of �4 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers. ', '�2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through proton', 'exchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Nafion�as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18].

We recently reported a class of ionomers based on aromatic hydrocarbon copolymers with high proton conductivity and excellent thermal mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states [22e29]. Sulfonated poly-arylenethioethersulfone(SPTES)copolymershavefollowing chemical structures (Fig. 1). ', 'SPTES copolymers including SPTES-50, SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80, have equivalent weight (EW) and IEC (mequiv./g) values of 610, 515, 459, 417, and 1.64, 1.94, 2.18, and 2.4, respectively [22]. They exhibited proton conductivity of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm respectively, at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity [22]. Their excellent proton conductivity at high temperatures combined with their high glass transition temperature (w200 �C) and mechanical stability (both in the dry and hydrated states) make them excellent potentials as high temperature PEM materials for fuel cells. SPTES-50 copolymer membrane has successfully been fabricated to membrane electrode assemblies and exhibited polarization curves and durability up to 400 h [29]. Their successful operations at 90e100 �C were limited by boiling point of water (100 �C at 1 atm). Replacing water molecules with heterocycles such as imidazolium where the charge carrier has a very low vapor pressure can result in proton conductivity at higher temperatures. Despite excellent electrochemical properties, excessive water uptake of SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes provide difficulties to be made as membrane electrode assembly [22,27] The proton transport and performance of SPTES copolymers highly depend on the presence of water molecules. In addition to the number of sulfonic groups, their acidity (pKa) ability to dissociate water molecules to proton, water activity coefficient, and number of water molecules associated with each sulfonic group, the supermolecular structure of the hydro-phobic and hydrophilic phases is also defined by polymer chain characteristics such as chain persistent length, and presence of sulfonic group on the backbone or in the side chains. We reported the presence of ionic nanodomains containing water molecules in the SPTES-70 using in-situ x-ray scattering [27]. The morphology and the nanostructure of SPTES-50 were approximated by corre-lated polydisperse spherical aggregates and a larger scale water domain network and were quantified by modeling of the SANS spectra with polydisperse hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [29]. This study reports the nanostructure and morphology of sulfonated polyarylenethioethersulfone (SPTES) copolymer membranes which is directly related to the proton transport through the membrane in terms of their degree of sulfonation and temperature dependency.', '2.

The resulting uniform flat films were immersed for 2 h in deionized water and dried under vacuum (24 h, 80 �C) after they were acidified in sulfuric acid (4 M, 24 h) to ensure complete conversion of sulfonic groups to their protonated forms.', '2.2.

Hydrated membranes were placed in demountable 1 mm thick titanium liquid cells filled with D2O after equilibrium in D2O (24 h). Scattered intensities were reduced, corrected for the transmission and background and placed on absolute scale. Then, circularly averaged to produce absolute scale scattering intensity, I(q), as a function of the wave vector, q, where q ¼ (4p/l)sin(q/2) and q is the scattering angle. Calculations were performed using Igor Pro�software [30,31]. USANS experiments covered a q-range of 0.00005 < q (Å�1) < 0.01, corresponding to a real-space length scale of 0.1 microne10 micron.', '3. Results and discussions', '3.1. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 25 �C', 'SPTES copolymers have high proton conductivity at high relative humidities and elevated temperatures; e.g. 65 �C and 85% RH of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers, respectively [27]. The degree of sulfonation increases for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6%, respectively. SPTES-50 copolymer has the lowest the degree of sulfonation and SPTES-80 copolymer has the highest degree of sulfonation in this class of copolymers [22,27]. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers at 25 �C show a scattering behavior of a two phase structure (Fig. 2a). The contribution of sulfonic groups to the scattering is considered to be negligible due to their small volume compared to the polymer and the water phase volume. It was visually observed that membranes do not dissociate when fully hydrated in the examined temperature. It was also determined by weight measurement that the membranes maintain the weight after deswelling. Therefore, the hydrophobic polymeric structure is the supporting network even at high water content and increased temperatures. Fig. 2a presents enhanced scattering intensity data (vertically shifted) for the hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copol-ymer membranes in the order of 20X, 1000X, and 2 �105X for the clarity of data presentation. The absolute scale scattering intensities in the medium q range of 0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1 are almost in the same intensity range for all SPTES copolymers. The high q scattering spectra for all copolymers exhibit a feature which is attributed to the presence of ionic domains containing water molecules. According to the scattering results, the morphology of all hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C can be approximated as correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates with liquid-like ordering (P.Y. ordering) and a power law decay [29]. The scattering data for the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C were compared and quantified using polydisperse (Schulz polydispersity) hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [32e34] and a low q power law decay [29].

Fig. 2b shows the experimental scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 25 �C compared with the theoretical calculations of the model (solid line). The results of the comparison of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes scattering data with the model are summarized in Table 1. According to this modeling the domain radius increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 13.45,14.9,15.4, and 16.9 Å for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes. The hard sphere packing density increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 19.8%, 23%, 25%, 29% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. This could indicate that ionic domains are capable of holding more water molecules with the presence of more sulfonic groups on the polymer backbone (increasing the degree of sulfonation). The high-q scattering spectra exhibits onset of a peak formation when the degree of sulfonation was increased to 71.6% for SPTES-80 copolymer. Pres-ence of scattering maxima can be due to the scattering from an ordered structure (periodicity) or the oscillations resulted from the structural factor effects or the excluded volume effect arising from short range liquid-like ordering. The onset of peak formation is attributed to the excluded volume effects related to the liquid-like ordering [33e35]. The low-q power law decay of nearly �3 was observed for all SPTES copolymers in the range of 1 �10�4 < q (1/ Å) < 3 �10�3. The power law decay of �3 is attributed to the presence of interacting three-dimensional fractal morphology. In addition, a Guinier plateau [35] was present for the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer at the very low q (q (1/Å) < 9 �10�5). This is in addition to the nearly identical scattering intensity in the inter-mediate q-range (0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1). It can be concluded that the change in the degree of sulfonation had little or no effect on the intermediate and low angle scattering wave vector. The low-q power law decay was nearly �3 �0.1 for all SPTES copolymers. The presence of sharp interface between hydrophobic and hydro-philic domains was deduced from the power law decay of �4 at large angle wave vectors for all hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes. All scattering data presented in Fig. 2a shows a power slope of �3.85 to �4.15 which is approximated as w �4. The presence of Porod behavior (decay of �4) has been attributed to the two immiscible phase with a sharp boundary [35e37]. This shows that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are separated with a distinct interface containing sulfonic groups. ', 'Presence of a plateau in the scattering spectra is characteristics of isolated scatterers [35]. The radius of gyration (Rg) of the isolated scatterers can be approximated by IðqÞ ¼ I0expðð�q2R2gÞ=3Þ, where I0 is the extrapolated zero scattering intensity (Guinier approxi-mation) [35]. Presence of the Guinier plateau in the q range of 4.3 �10�5 < q (1/Å) < 8.2 �10�5 for SPTES-80 copolymer suggests segregation of the isolated large scale hydrophilic water pockets when the degree of sulfonation increased to 71.6%.

Fig. 3 exhibits the scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. The inter-mediate scattering intensity decreased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes start to form scattering maxima at high q range when the degree of sulfonation increased. This indicated the increase in the excluded volume due to the increase in the volume of the scatterers at higher degree of sulfonation and increased temperature (55 �C). The presence of scattering maxima is more significant for SPTES-70 copolymer and SPTES-80 copolymer with 63.3 and 71.6% degree of sulfonation. The large angle scattering feature shows scattering maxima at qmax of 0.103 and 0.1108 1/Å for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers which correspond to spatial characteristics lengths (l ¼ 2p/qmax) of 60.97 and 56.7 Å due to concentration fluctuations of hydrated domains (hard spheres). The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes changed significantlywith increasing degree of sulfonation. This indicates a substantial change in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology with increasing degree of sulfonation at 55 �C which is more pronounced for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers (degree of sulfonation 63.3 and 71.6%, respectively). Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are segregated distinctly by the sulfonic groups at the interface which is repre-sented by the Porod behavior, asymptotic behavior of w �4 for all SPTES copolymers [35e37]. The morphology of these membranes is complex and controlled by interfacial phenomena. The number of sulfonic groups per repeat unit volume and their acidity com-plemented with the chain persistent length and chain mobility are governing factors in the formed morphology. This study approxi-mates the morphology of the fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55 �C are approximated as spherical nanodomains containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering similar to their morphology at 25 �C. It is also proposed that this morphology changedtofractalmorphologywithincreasing temperature (increasing the intermediate scattering decay). The domain radius and the sphere packing density were increased from 26.4 Å and 28% for SPTES-50 copolymer to 32 Å and 33% for SPTES-60copolymerwhiletheintermediatescatteringintensity decreased. The domain radius and packing density of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane increased from 13.45 Å and 19.8% to 26.4 Å and 28% when the temperature increased from 25 �C to 55 �C with this approximation. The same increasing trend of 14.9 Åe32 Å for the average domain radius and 23%e33% of the sphere packing density was observed. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane compared to the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane is attributed to the disruption of the large scale morphology. The low q power law decay of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane was close to the decay of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane. ', 'The increase in the degree of sulfonation of SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymers from 54.9, to 63.3 and 71.6% resulted in a shift in the position of the high q scattering maxima of the hydrated membranes toward the large angle scattering regime. This peak formation is more prominent for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copoly-mers with higher sulfonation degree. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering intensity in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70 and', '-80 copolymers is attributed to the loss of the large scale water network, intermediate fractal morphology within the polymer and onset of a morphology change to a two large scale phase morphology. The closed domain morphology of polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with fractal network were present for fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55�C (Figs. 3 and 4a). However, substantialchangesinthemorphologyoffullyhydrated membranes occurred when the degree of sulfonation is increased to 63.3 and 71.6% for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers at higher temperature of 55 �C. Combination of high temperature, high density of sulfonic groups, and significant amount of water mole-cules within the polymer backbone could have resulted in the coalescence of the small spherical ionic domains and fractal water network into a larger scale bicontinuous network of intermeshed hydrophobic and hydrophilic morphology for fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane at 55 �C. The bicontinuous model origi-nally proposed for micro-emulsion of two immiscible phases of water and oil with comparable amount based on Landau theory [38,39]. This model describes two irregular shapes with distinct boundary and has been used for intermesh of hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure when the particle shape is not well-defined [40,41]. This model proposes I(q) ¼ (a2þc1q þ c2q2)�1 for a2 > 0, c1 < 0, and c2 > 0, a single broad scattering maxima, and power law decay of �4 at large scattering angles. Two characteristics lengths of d and x are deduced from this analysis having a2, c1, and c2[39,40], d is the domain periodicity or interdomain distance and x is the correlation length which has been attributed to the dispersion of d. According to this theory, c1 is negative due to the surfactant. The absolute values of c1 and the ratio of x/d should increase with increasing surfactant. The specific internal surface area can be derived from the ratio of S/V ¼ 44(1�4)/x [38,39].

According to this simulation, the correlation length (x) is 31.14 Å. The medium-q range scattering still exhibits the larger scale morphology which is not completely converted to the bi-continuous phase morphology. However, they are partially collapsed characterized by a lower scattering intensity in the intermediate q range. The high q maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 is approximated as bicontinuous morphology. The low and medium q (q < 0.037 1/Å) scattering spectra of the SPTES 70 is due to the presence of fractal network of waters which have not coalesce yet.

The periodicity of the water domains (or hydrophobic domains), d, predicted by this model is w54 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima (qmax), 56.7 Å. This value is the distance between water domains. The correlation length (x) obtained from this model is 37.86 Å which is a measure of dispersion.

The correlation length, x, was increased from 31.14 Å to 37.86 Å when the degree of sulfonation increased. Increasing the interfacial area results in an increase in the x/d ratio.

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25\ue000C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 \ue000C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 \ue00110\ue0024 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 \ue0030.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 \ue000C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 \ue000C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of \ue0024 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 \ue000C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by signi\ue000cant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of \ue0024 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers. ', '\ue0002011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through proton', 'exchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell.

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25\ue000C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 \ue000C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 \ue00110\ue0024 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 \ue0030.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 \ue000C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 \ue000C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of \ue0024 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 \ue000C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by signi\ue000cant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of \ue0024 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers. ', '\ue0002011 Elsevier Ltd.

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25\ue000C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 \ue000C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 \ue00110\ue0024 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 \ue0030.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 \ue000C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 \ue000C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of \ue0024 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 \ue000C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by signi\ue000cant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity.

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25�C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 �C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 �10�4 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 �0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 �C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 �C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by significant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of �4 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers. ', '�2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang-', '∗Corresponding author.

To achieve this purpose, they are usually doped with a sufficient acid like H3PO4 to an appropriate doping level [13]. Nanocomposite membranes are a new group of membranes which contain nanopar-ticles such as SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 and other compounds [14–21]. The introduction of nanoparticles into the membranes results in a considerable improvement in their features like mechani-cal properties, methanol permeability, but in some cases leads to a decrease in proton conductivity [22–24].

However, in this work, we have used monomer bearing functional groups like imidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene which can improve the properties of pro-ton conductive membranes. These monomers are polymerized on the surface of the nanoparticles and as a consequence, they can more affect the properties of the membranes than while one functional group is grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. In addition, the polymerization of the selected monomers such as vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface of nanoparticle could cause more compatibility between nanopar-ticles and polymer matrix which finally improve the mechanical properties.

Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang-', '∗Corresponding author.

', 'Consequently, the highest proton conductivity was obtained withtheacid-dopedPPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%membraneathigh humidity and low temperatures and PPBI/SiO2-PVI-15% mem-brane in high temperatures and low humidity, which possesses the moderate modified nanoparticles content and acid-doping level. ', 'As it is seen in Fig. 9, either we use PSV-modified or un-modified nanoparticles, the increase in the amount of the nanoparticles leads', '2580H. Namazi, H. Ahmadi / Journal of Power Sources 196 (2011) 2573–2583', 'Fig. 13. Illustration of the state of water in the membranes, the interaction between the functional groups of nanoparticles and of PPBI to restrict the nanoparticles motion, and the proton-transport mechanism in the membranes [24].', 'to a decrease in the acid doping level, but when PVI-modified nanoparticles were used, doping level increased. Also, according to Fig. 8, water uptake of the membrane shows an increase when using higher amounts of modified nanoparticles. This increase in PSV-modified nanocomposite membranesishigherinPVI-modified one. Proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PSV-modified nanoparticles shows significant increase in comparison to PVI-modified ones in low temperature and high rel-ative humidity. But in high temperature and low relative humidity, proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PVI-modified nanoparticles is observed to be more than PSV-modified ones and even at 145 ◦C the proton conductivity of PPBI/SiO2-PVI 15% is more than PPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%. The exis-tence of modified nanoparticles in PPBI nanocomposite membranes results in high proton conductivity in three ways:', '1) With increase in water uptake ', '2) With increase in the amount of doping level and ', '3) With increase in the number of proton conductive functional ', 'groups such as sulfonic acid group.', 'In PSV-modified nanocomposite membranes, acid doping decreases while the water uptake and the number of sulfonic acid groups shows an increase. Consequently, high proton conductiv-ity can be a result of these changes. It should be mentioned that in temperatures higher than 100 ◦C and in very low relative humidity, water uptake of PSV-modified membranes decreases which leads to low efficiency of the sulfonic groups attached onto the surface of the nanoparticles which in turn results in a decrease in proton conduc-tivity in both membranes, but the increase in proton conductivity resulting from high doping level is significant and also the proton conductivity of PVI-modified nanocomposite membranes increase in high temperatures. ', 'It is noteworthy that Nafion® 117 shows relatively low pro-ton conductivities under anhydrous conditions and almost lacks its proton conductivities at high temperatures. Comparing to Nafion®', '117 membranes, the high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicate that this membrane could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', '3.5. Mechanical properties', 'The mechanical properties of the PPBI-based membranes were measured. The stress–strain curves are shown in Fig. 14. Pristine', 'PPBI membrane showed an elongation at break of 38%. Mod-ification of nanocomposites with SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles results in an increase in the tensile strengths and a subse-quent decrease in the elongations at break for the PPBI-based membranes. For PPBI/modified nanoparticles nanocomposites membranes (PPBI/modified nanocomposite consists of the PPBI and surface-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles by PVI and PSV chains and PPBI/unmodified nanocomposite includes PPBI and SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles without any treatment), the presence of ionic linkages between PPBI and silica particles can be assigned to their high Young’s modulus. Introduction of modified and un-modified nanoparticles increases the brittleness of the nanocomposite mem-branes with a decrease in their elongations at break. The effects of modified and unmodified nanoparticles on the elongations at break of the nanocomposite membranes were different. The decrease in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness were widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inorganic reinforcement [37–39]. Moreover, the ionic linkages in nanocomposite membranes prepared from modi-fied nanoparticles are higher than hydrogen bonding in PPBI/SiO2and PPBI/TiO2.', 'Fig. 14. Stress–strain curves of PPBI and nanocomposite membranes containing 10% nanoparticles.', 'H. Namazi, H. Ahmadi / Journal of Power Sources 196 (2011) 2573–25832581', 'Fig. 15. The SEM photograph of a) pure PPBI membrane and TiO2-PSV nanocomposite membranes containing of b) 5%, c) 10% and d) 15% nanoparticles.', 'The brittleness of PPBI/TiO2 based nanocomposite membranes is higher than PPBI/SiO2 ones. The brittleness of membranes pre-pared from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI are less than PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV membranes which are perhaps due to more com-patibility of PVI grafted chains onto the nanoparticles surface with PPBI backbone. ', 'Comparing the brittleness of the nanocomposite membranes of the PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/SiO2-PVI with PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, respectively indicates that the brittleness of the membranes prepared with modified SiO2 nanoparticles is less than the modified TiO2 ones.', '3.6. Morphological analysis', 'The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photographs of the PPBI/TiO2-PSV nanocomposite membranes surface with various amounts of TiO2-PSV are shown in Fig. 15. ', 'A relatively flat surface is observed for thin membranes of pure PPBI (Fig. 15(a)). Fig. 15(b–d) display surface morphological properties of nanocomposite membranes having 5, 10 and 15% of TiO2-PSV, respectively. ', 'As seen in Fig. 15, TiO2-PSV nanoparticles are dispersed homo-geneously in PPBI matrixes and are increased with increasing of the percentage of TiO2-PSV nanoparticles. Also the major amounts of nanoparticles size are in the range of nanoscale and the bigger parti-cles as evidence for the formation of aggregations are not observed.', 'The size of the TiO2-PSV particles are about 25–40 nm and the size of particles on the surface of the nanocomposite are determined to be 30–60 nm.', 'Fig. 16(a) shows the SEM micrographs of the modified SiO2nanoparticles. If the interactions between silica nanoparticles are stronger than that of between PPBI molecules and silica nanoparticles, the silica nanoparticles are agglomerated together to form silica domains in micrometer sizes. The compatibility between PPBI and unmodified nanoparticles and the homogene-ity of the PPBI/SiO2 or PPBI/TiO2 membranes are somewhat poor [32]. ', 'However, the dispersion homogeneity of silica nanoparticles in PPBI membranes could be significantly improved with using surface modified nanoparticles as the additives. As shown in Fig. 16(b), the dispersion homogeneity of modified nanoparticles is observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2 nanocomposite membrane, which demonstrates high compatibility between PPBI polymer and PSV-SiO2 nanoparticles and the high dispersion abil-ity of PSV-SiO2 in PPBI matrix. Particle agglomeration is still not observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2-10%. The ionic linkages between PPBI and modified nanoparticles are contributed to their higher compatibility [32]. However, in nanocompos-ite membranes prepared from un-modified SiO2 nanoparticles, thedispersionofthenanoparticlesinpolymermatrixis not homogenous and probably aggregation has been formed (Fig. 16(c)).', '2582H. Namazi, H. Ahmadi / Journal of Power Sources 196 (2011) 2573–2583', 'Fig. 16. SEM micrograph of SiO2-PSV (a); TEM micrographs of PPBI/SiO2-PSV-10% (b); and PPBI/SiO2-10% (c).', '4. Conclusion', 'The nanocomposite PPBI-based membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified and un-modified TiO2 and SiO2nanoparticles. The thermal stability of the prepared nanocompos-', 'ite membranes was similar to PPBI membrane. The water uptake of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from TiO2/PSV and SiO2/PSV nanoparticles were higher than other nanocomposite membranes. The acid doping level and proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes in dry conditions obtained from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI nanoparticles were the highest in comparison to PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV. Formation of nanocomposites with modified and un-modified nanoparticles resulted the increas-ing of tensile strengths. The decreasing in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness was widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inor-ganic reinforcement. The high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicated that this membrane could be utilized as a proton exchange membrane for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. M.-G.

Imida-zole and sulfonated vinylbenzene groups on the surface of modified nanoparticles forming linkages with PPBI chains, improved the compatibility between PPBI and nanoparticles, and enhanced the mechanical strength of the prepared nanocomposite membranes. The prepared nanocomposite membranes showed higher water uptake and acid doping levels comparing to PPBI. Also, after acid doping with phosphoric acid, nanocomposite membranes exhibited enhanced proton conductivity in comparison to the pristine PPBI and PPBI/un-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. The enhancement in proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes resulted from modified SiO2 nanoparticles showed higher conductivity than modified TiO2 nanoparticles.

All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang-', '∗Corresponding author.

', 'PBIs should have enough proton conductivity so that it could be used as proton exchange membranes in the fuel cells. To achieve this purpose, they are usually doped with a sufficient acid like H3PO4 to an appropriate doping level [13]. Nanocomposite membranes are a new group of membranes which contain nanopar-ticles such as SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 and other compounds [14–21]. The introduction of nanoparticles into the membranes results in a considerable improvement in their features like mechani-cal properties, methanol permeability, but in some cases leads to a decrease in proton conductivity [22–24].

As men-tioned before, the numerous research works were done concerning grafting various compounds on the SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles which used for different purposes. However, in this work, we have used monomer bearing functional groups like imidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene which can improve the properties of pro-ton conductive membranes. These monomers are polymerized on the surface of the nanoparticles and as a consequence, they can more affect the properties of the membranes than while one functional group is grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. In addition, the polymerization of the selected monomers such as vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface of nanoparticle could cause more compatibility between nanopar-ticles and polymer matrix which finally improve the mechanical properties. In this work, nanocomposite membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles and newly synthesized polybenzimidazole was depicted poly[2,2-5,5-(m-pyrazolidene)-bibenzimidazole] (PPBI). Modification of the mentioned nanoparticles was performed by radical polymerization of some vinyl monomers such as sulfonated styrene and vinylim-idazole on the surface of the nanoparticles to which vinylic group was bounded covalently.

Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang-', '∗Corresponding author.

Acid-doping level (H3PO4 molecules per PPBI repeating unit) of pristine PPBI membrane was 13.5, which decreased to 11.8 for PPBI/SiO2, 12.0 for PPBI/SiO2-PSV, 11.7 for PPBI/TiO2 and 12.2 for PPBI/TiO2-PSV', 'Fig. 9.

Some of the amino groups in PPBI chains were blocked with the sulfonic acid groups of TiO2-PSV and SiO2-PSV, to decrease the binding ability of PPBI chains to H3PO4molecules. ', 'Among the prepared nanocomposites, the water uptake in PPBI/SiO2-PSV and acid doping in PPBI/SiO2-PVI were the most one. Even in the comparison of these membranes with the simi-lar ones which prepared from modified TiO2 such as PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, the amount of water uptake and doping level were higher. This shows that using modified SiO2 nanoparticles in fuel cells is more appropriate.', '3.4. Proton conductivity', 'The membrane was sandwiched between two stainless steel electrodes and pressed together by clamp. Then, the MEA (Mem-brane Electrolyte Assembly) was inputted in the steam autoclave equipped with temperature controller. For measurement of pro-ton conductivity, the steam autoclave supplied with steam from a house generator for exposure to saturated steam at desired temperature. As an example, for saturated steam the pressure cor-responding to 120 ◦C is 205 kPa. The time of exposure to saturated steam at 120 ◦C was 30 min that this value for temperature of 140 ◦C was increased to 50 min.', 'Fig. 10 shows the Nyquist plot and equivalent circuit of studied membranes at 25 ◦C and RH 100% for some membranes. ', 'After fitting the EIS experimental data on the electrical equiv-alent circuit, the membrane proton conductivity was determined from the intercept of EIS data with real impedance Z′ axis (as the value of Rm element). In equivalent circuit, Rm presents the resis-tance of the polymer film between the two metallic electrodes toward charge carriers (i.e. H+). L1 presents the stray inductance of the setup wires.

The proton conductivities of the phosphoric acid-doped PPBI based nanocomposite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 11) at 100% relative humidity were presented as a function of temperatures up to 80 ◦C. The pro-ton conductivities of all membranes increased with increasing the operation temperature up to 80 ◦C.

', 'On the other hand, comparing the pristine PPBI and Nafion®', '117 membranes, the relatively high proton conductivities of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles are noteworthy [32]. Li et al. have used sulfonated organosilica to modify Nafion® membranes and they found that the proton con-ductivities of the modified membranes were still lower than that of the neat Nafion® membrane. ', 'The reduction in the proton conductivity was attributed to the silica-induced changes in the tortuous paths and in the dis-tribution of hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains. However, in this work an enhancing effect on the proton conductivity was observed with addition of PSV and PVI grafted nanoparticles to PPBI mem-brane. The sulfonic and imidazole groups of modified nanoparticles also contribute in the acid-doping effect to PPBI polymer so as to enhance the proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles. Moreover, the presence of modified nanoparticles induces proton conductive pathways lead-ing to an increase in the proton conductivities of PPBI/modified nanoparticles membranes [24].

Proton conductivities of PPBI based nanocomposite membranes containing SiO2 (a) and TiO2 (b) nanoparticles at dry environment up to 145 ◦C.', 'studied at high temperatures under an anhydrous environment. All the PPBI/modified nanoparticle membranes still exhibited higher proton conductivities than the pristine acid-doped PPBI membrane. ', 'Generally, two principle mechanisms of vehicle mechanism and Grotthuss mechanism (hopping) describe proton diffusion through the membrane [33]. It is possible that the bounded water par-ticipates by the Grotthuss mechanism, and the free water takes part mostly by vehicle mechanism [34]. Addition of silica-SO3H to the membranes increases the bounded water content in the membranes (Fig. 13). The bounded water facilitates the proton transport ability through the Grotthuss mechanism, originating by generation of a continuous proton conductive pathway. There-fore, the high proton conductivity of PPBI/modified nanoparticles can be attributed to the high bounded water content in the membrane. ', 'Since the Grotthuss-type diffusion mechanism without assis-tance of the vehicle mechanism has been proposed for the protonconductionunderanhydrousenvironments[35,36], theprotonconductivityoftheacid-dopedPPBI/modified nanoparticlemembranescouldbesynergisticallyresulted from their modified nanoparticle contents and the acid-doping levels.

Also, according to Fig. 8, water uptake of the membrane shows an increase when using higher amounts of modified nanoparticles. This increase in PSV-modified nanocomposite membranesishigherinPVI-modified one. Proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PSV-modified nanoparticles shows significant increase in comparison to PVI-modified ones in low temperature and high rel-ative humidity. But in high temperature and low relative humidity, proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PVI-modified nanoparticles is observed to be more than PSV-modified ones and even at 145 ◦C the proton conductivity of PPBI/SiO2-PVI 15% is more than PPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%. The exis-tence of modified nanoparticles in PPBI nanocomposite membranes results in high proton conductivity in three ways:', '1) With increase in water uptake ', '2) With increase in the amount of doping level and ', '3) With increase in the number of proton conductive functional ', 'groups such as sulfonic acid group.', 'In PSV-modified nanocomposite membranes, acid doping decreases while the water uptake and the number of sulfonic acid groups shows an increase. Consequently, high proton conductiv-ity can be a result of these changes. It should be mentioned that in temperatures higher than 100 ◦C and in very low relative humidity, water uptake of PSV-modified membranes decreases which leads to low efficiency of the sulfonic groups attached onto the surface of the nanoparticles which in turn results in a decrease in proton conduc-tivity in both membranes, but the increase in proton conductivity resulting from high doping level is significant and also the proton conductivity of PVI-modified nanocomposite membranes increase in high temperatures. ', 'It is noteworthy that Nafion® 117 shows relatively low pro-ton conductivities under anhydrous conditions and almost lacks its proton conductivities at high temperatures. Comparing to Nafion®', '117 membranes, the high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicate that this membrane could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', '3.5. Mechanical properties', 'The mechanical properties of the PPBI-based membranes were measured. The stress–strain curves are shown in Fig. 14. Pristine', 'PPBI membrane showed an elongation at break of 38%. Mod-ification of nanocomposites with SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles results in an increase in the tensile strengths and a subse-quent decrease in the elongations at break for the PPBI-based membranes. For PPBI/modified nanoparticles nanocomposites membranes (PPBI/modified nanocomposite consists of the PPBI and surface-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles by PVI and PSV chains and PPBI/unmodified nanocomposite includes PPBI and SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles without any treatment), the presence of ionic linkages between PPBI and silica particles can be assigned to their high Young’s modulus. Introduction of modified and un-modified nanoparticles increases the brittleness of the nanocomposite mem-branes with a decrease in their elongations at break. The effects of modified and unmodified nanoparticles on the elongations at break of the nanocomposite membranes were different. The decrease in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness were widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inorganic reinforcement [37–39]. Moreover, the ionic linkages in nanocomposite membranes prepared from modi-fied nanoparticles are higher than hydrogen bonding in PPBI/SiO2and PPBI/TiO2.', 'Fig. 14.

The brittleness of membranes pre-pared from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI are less than PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV membranes which are perhaps due to more com-patibility of PVI grafted chains onto the nanoparticles surface with PPBI backbone. ', 'Comparing the brittleness of the nanocomposite membranes of the PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/SiO2-PVI with PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, respectively indicates that the brittleness of the membranes prepared with modified SiO2 nanoparticles is less than the modified TiO2 ones.', '3.6.

If the interactions between silica nanoparticles are stronger than that of between PPBI molecules and silica nanoparticles, the silica nanoparticles are agglomerated together to form silica domains in micrometer sizes. The compatibility between PPBI and unmodified nanoparticles and the homogene-ity of the PPBI/SiO2 or PPBI/TiO2 membranes are somewhat poor [32].

As shown in Fig. 16(b), the dispersion homogeneity of modified nanoparticles is observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2 nanocomposite membrane, which demonstrates high compatibility between PPBI polymer and PSV-SiO2 nanoparticles and the high dispersion abil-ity of PSV-SiO2 in PPBI matrix. Particle agglomeration is still not observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2-10%. The ionic linkages between PPBI and modified nanoparticles are contributed to their higher compatibility [32].

Conclusion', 'The nanocomposite PPBI-based membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified and un-modified TiO2 and SiO2nanoparticles.

The acid doping level and proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes in dry conditions obtained from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI nanoparticles were the highest in comparison to PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV. Formation of nanocomposites with modified and un-modified nanoparticles resulted the increas-ing of tensile strengths. The decreasing in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness was widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inor-ganic reinforcement. The high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicated that this membrane could be utilized as a proton exchange membrane for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. M.-G.
