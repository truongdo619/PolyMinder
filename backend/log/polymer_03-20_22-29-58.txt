The polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were utilized as a functional additive to prepare PPBI/polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. Imida-zole and sulfonated vinylbenzene groups on the surface of modified nanoparticles forming linkages with PPBI chains, improved the compatibility between PPBI and nanoparticles, and enhanced the mechanical strength of the prepared nanocomposite membranes. The prepared nanocomposite membranes showed higher water uptake and acid doping levels comparing to PPBI.

All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang-', 'ers [1–3]. Sulfonated polysulfone (PSF) [4], polyetheretherketone (PEEK) [5,6] and polybenzimidazoles (PBIs) [7–11] are among poly-mers which can be used as alternatives for Nafion in PEFCs.', 'Amongpolybenzimidazolederivatives,poly[2,2-5,5(m-phenylene)-bibenzimidazole](PBI),whichisalsocalled commercial polybenzimidazole have been used as a mem-brane material in PEMFCs. Having high chemical as well as thermal resistance and proton conductivity, polybenzimidazoles are great options to be used in the fuel cells with function at elevated temperatures above 100 ◦C [12].', 'PBIs should have enough proton conductivity so that it could be used as proton exchange membranes in the fuel cells. To achieve this purpose, they are usually doped with a sufficient acid like H3PO4 to an appropriate doping level [13]. Nanocomposite membranes are a new group of membranes which contain nanopar-ticles such as SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 and other compounds [14–21]. The introduction of nanoparticles into the membranes results in a considerable improvement in their features like mechani-cal properties, methanol permeability, but in some cases leads to a decrease in proton conductivity [22–24]. In order to over-come this problem, surface functionalized nanoparticles, which means various compounds with polar groups grafted chemically', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'to the surface of the nanoparticles [25–28], were used. As men-tioned before, the numerous research works were done concerning grafting various compounds on the SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles which used for different purposes. However, in this work, we have used monomer bearing functional groups like imidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene which can improve the properties of pro-ton conductive membranes. These monomers are polymerized on the surface of the nanoparticles and as a consequence, they can more affect the properties of the membranes than while one functional group is grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. In addition, the polymerization of the selected monomers such as vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface of nanoparticle could cause more compatibility between nanopar-ticles and polymer matrix which finally improve the mechanical properties. In this work, nanocomposite membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles and newly synthesized polybenzimidazole was depicted poly[2,2-5,5-(m-pyrazolidene)-bibenzimidazole] (PPBI). Modification of the mentioned nanoparticles was performed by radical polymerization of some vinyl monomers such as sulfonated styrene and vinylim-idazole on the surface of the nanoparticles to which vinylic group was bounded covalently.

The FT-IR spectrum of the obtained powder did not show any absorbent bands related to PVI and PSV chains. The absorbent bands, which existed in the spectrum of mod-ified nanoparticles, were not observed in this spectrum.

Thermal analysis', 'Thermogravimetric analysis diagrams of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 5. Weight loss in 85 ◦C can be related to the release of physically absorbed water. In un-modified nanoparticles, the minor weight loss in elevated temperatures can be attributed to the loss of hydroxyl groups of the particle surface attached by covalent bonds. Weight loss in modified nanoparticles could be a result of thermal degradation of the polymeric chains grafted to the surface of the nanoparti-cles. Also, the weight loss in 230–300 ◦C was due to the thermal decomposition of the sulfonate groups in the grafted PSV chains [30].', 'Thermograms of PVI modified nanocomposite with 5, 10 and 15% of TiO2 are shown in Fig. 6.

They were heated to temperatures about 1000 ◦C for 30 min and the obtained nanoparti-cles were weighed immediately.

The weight loss observed in the tempera-ture range of 50–140 ◦C is a result of the release of water adsorbed into the membranes which is less significant in nanocomposites in comparison to pure membrane.', 'The second loss in weight, observed at the temperature range of 500–530 ◦C, is also attributed to the thermal degradation of poly-meric backbone of the nanocomposite membranes which is almost identical to the degradation temperature of pure PPBI. As a result, the addition of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles do not have any noticeable effect on thermal stability of the prepared nanocomposites.', 'As it is observed in Fig. 7, the degradation of PVI-modified nanoparticles occurs at 185 ◦C which is lower than the related tem-perature of PSV-modified ones.

Water uptake and doping level', 'Water uptake amount of nanocomposite membranes contain-ing 5, 10 and 15% of modified nanoparticles at 25 ◦C are shown in Fig. 8. Addition of silica nanoparticles to PPBI membranes increased their water uptakes due to the hygroscopic nature of SiO2 and TiO2nanoparticles. The sulfonic and imidazole groups in the nanopar-ticles increased the water uptake to a greater extent. The amount of water uptake for PPBI/TiO2-PSV, PPBI/SiO2-PSV, PPBI/TiO2-PVI and PPBI/SiO2-PVI are 21.6, 22.7, 20.4 and 21.9%, respectively. The effect of sulfonic acid groups of PSV chains grafted onto the nanoparticle surface on the water uptake is more than imidazole groups in PVI chains due to the higher hygroscopic properties of PSV comparing to PVI chains grafted on to the silica nanopar-ticle surface. The water uptake of PPBI/SiO2-PSV is higher than PPBI/TiO2-PSV which can be due to the further increase of the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles in comparison to TiO2 nanoparticle surface.', 'The PPBI-based membranes were doped with 85% H3PO4 to prepare the acid-doped membranes. Fig. 9 shows the acid-doping levels of the PPBI-based nanocomposite membranes. Acid-doping level (H3PO4 molecules per PPBI repeating unit) of pristine PPBI membrane was 13.5, which decreased to 11.8 for PPBI/SiO2, 12.0 for PPBI/SiO2-PSV, 11.7 for PPBI/TiO2 and 12.2 for PPBI/TiO2-PSV', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'with 10% nanoparticle content and increased to 15.8 for PPBI/SiO2-PVI and 15.2 for PPBI/TiO2-PVI.

Even in the comparison of these membranes with the simi-lar ones which prepared from modified TiO2 such as PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, the amount of water uptake and doping level were higher. This shows that using modified SiO2 nanoparticles in fuel cells is more appropriate.', '3.4.

Then, the MEA (Mem-brane Electrolyte Assembly) was inputted in the steam autoclave equipped with temperature controller. For measurement of pro-ton conductivity, the steam autoclave supplied with steam from a house generator for exposure to saturated steam at desired temperature. As an example, for saturated steam the pressure cor-responding to 120 ◦C is 205 kPa. The time of exposure to saturated steam at 120 ◦C was 30 min that this value for temperature of 140 ◦C was increased to 50 min.', 'Fig. 10 shows the Nyquist plot and equivalent circuit of studied membranes at 25 ◦C and RH 100% for some membranes.', 'After fitting the EIS experimental data on the electrical equiv-alent circuit, the membrane proton conductivity was determined from the intercept of EIS data with real impedance Z′ axis (as the value of Rm element). In equivalent circuit, Rm presents the resis-tance of the polymer film between the two metallic electrodes toward charge carriers (i.e. H+). L1 presents the stray inductance of the setup wires.

Li et al. have used sulfonated organosilica to modify Nafion® membranes and they found that the proton con-ductivities of the modified membranes were still lower than that of the neat Nafion® membrane.', 'The reduction in the proton conductivity was attributed to the silica-induced changes in the tortuous paths and in the dis-tribution of hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains. However, in this work an enhancing effect on the proton conductivity was observed with addition of PSV and PVI grafted nanoparticles to PPBI mem-brane. The sulfonic and imidazole groups of modified nanoparticles also contribute in the acid-doping effect to PPBI polymer so as to enhance the proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles. Moreover, the presence of modified nanoparticles induces proton conductive pathways lead-ing to an increase in the proton conductivities of PPBI/modified nanoparticles membranes [24].', 'The proton conductivities of the acid-doped nanocompos-ite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 12) were further', '@', '@', 'studied at high temperatures under an anhydrous environment. All the PPBI/modified nanoparticle membranes still exhibited higher proton conductivities than the pristine acid-doped PPBI membrane.', 'Generally, two principle mechanisms of vehicle mechanism and Grotthuss mechanism (hopping) describe proton diffusion through the membrane [33]. It is possible that the bounded water par-ticipates by the Grotthuss mechanism, and the free water takes part mostly by vehicle mechanism [34]. Addition of silica-SO3H to the membranes increases the bounded water content in the membranes (Fig. 13). The bounded water facilitates the proton transport ability through the Grotthuss mechanism, originating by generation of a continuous proton conductive pathway. There-fore, the high proton conductivity of PPBI/modified nanoparticles can be attributed to the high bounded water content in the membrane.', 'Since the Grotthuss-type diffusion mechanism without assis-tance of the vehicle mechanism has been proposed for the protonconductionunderanhydrousenvironments[35,36], theprotonconductivityoftheacid-dopedPPBI/modified nanoparticlemembranescouldbesynergisticallyresulted from their modified nanoparticle contents and the acid-doping levels.', 'Consequently, the highest proton conductivity was obtained withtheacid-dopedPPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%membraneathigh humidity and low temperatures and PPBI/SiO2-PVI-15% mem-brane in high temperatures and low humidity, which possesses the moderate modified nanoparticles content and acid-doping level.', 'As it is seen in Fig. 9, either we use PSV-modified or un-modified nanoparticles, the increase in the amount of the nanoparticles leads', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'to a decrease in the acid doping level, but when PVI-modified nanoparticles were used, doping level increased.

Proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PSV-modified nanoparticles shows significant increase in comparison to PVI-modified ones in low temperature and high rel-ative humidity. But in high temperature and low relative humidity, proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PVI-modified nanoparticles is observed to be more than PSV-modified ones and even at 145 ◦C the proton conductivity of PPBI/SiO2-PVI 15% is more than PPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%.

Consequently, high proton conductiv-ity can be a result of these changes. It should be mentioned that in temperatures higher than 100 ◦C and in very low relative humidity, water uptake of PSV-modified membranes decreases which leads to low efficiency of the sulfonic groups attached onto the surface of the nanoparticles which in turn results in a decrease in proton conduc-tivity in both membranes, but the increase in proton conductivity resulting from high doping level is significant and also the proton conductivity of PVI-modified nanocomposite membranes increase in high temperatures.', 'It is noteworthy that Nafion® 117 shows relatively low pro-ton conductivities under anhydrous conditions and almost lacks its proton conductivities at high temperatures. Comparing to Nafion®117 membranes, the high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicate that this membrane could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', '3.5. Mechanical properties', 'The mechanical properties of the PPBI-based membranes were measured. The stress–strain curves are shown in Fig. 14. Pristine', 'PPBI membrane showed an elongation at break of 38%. Mod-ification of nanocomposites with SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles results in an increase in the tensile strengths and a subse-quent decrease in the elongations at break for the PPBI-based membranes. For PPBI/modified nanoparticles nanocomposites membranes (PPBI/modified nanocomposite consists of the PPBI and surface-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles by PVI and PSV chains and PPBI/unmodified nanocomposite includes PPBI and SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles without any treatment), the presence of ionic linkages between PPBI and silica particles can be assigned to their high Young’s modulus. Introduction of modified and un-modified nanoparticles increases the brittleness of the nanocomposite mem-branes with a decrease in their elongations at break. The effects of modified and unmodified nanoparticles on the elongations at break of the nanocomposite membranes were different. The decrease in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness were widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inorganic reinforcement [37–39]. Moreover, the ionic linkages in nanocomposite membranes prepared from modi-fied nanoparticles are higher than hydrogen bonding in PPBI/SiO2and PPBI/TiO2.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The brittleness of PPBI/TiO2 based nanocomposite membranes is higher than PPBI/SiO2 ones. The brittleness of membranes pre-pared from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI are less than PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV membranes which are perhaps due to more com-patibility of PVI grafted chains onto the nanoparticles surface with PPBI backbone.', 'Comparing the brittleness of the nanocomposite membranes of the PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/SiO2-PVI with PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, respectively indicates that the brittleness of the membranes prepared with modified SiO2 nanoparticles is less than the modified TiO2 ones.', '3.6. Morphological analysis', 'The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photographs of the PPBI/TiO2-PSV nanocomposite membranes surface with various amounts of TiO2-PSV are shown in Fig. 15.', 'A relatively flat surface is observed for thin membranes of pure PPBI (Fig. 15(a)). Fig. 15(b–d) display surface morphological properties of nanocomposite membranes having 5, 10 and 15% of TiO2-PSV, respectively.', 'As seen in Fig. 15, TiO2-PSV nanoparticles are dispersed homo-geneously in PPBI matrixes and are increased with increasing of the percentage of TiO2-PSV nanoparticles. Also the major amounts of nanoparticles size are in the range of nanoscale and the bigger parti-cles as evidence for the formation of aggregations are not observed.', 'The size of the TiO2-PSV particles are about 25–40 nm and the size of particles on the surface of the nanocomposite are determined to be 30–60 nm.', 'Fig. 16(a) shows the SEM micrographs of the modified SiO2nanoparticles. If the interactions between silica nanoparticles are stronger than that of between PPBI molecules and silica nanoparticles, the silica nanoparticles are agglomerated together to form silica domains in micrometer sizes. The compatibility between PPBI and unmodified nanoparticles and the homogene-ity of the PPBI/SiO2 or PPBI/TiO2 membranes are somewhat poor [32].', 'However, the dispersion homogeneity of silica nanoparticles in PPBI membranes could be significantly improved with using surface modified nanoparticles as the additives. As shown in Fig. 16(b), the dispersion homogeneity of modified nanoparticles is observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2 nanocomposite membrane, which demonstrates high compatibility between PPBI polymer and PSV-SiO2 nanoparticles and the high dispersion abil-ity of PSV-SiO2 in PPBI matrix. Particle agglomeration is still not observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2-10%. The ionic linkages between PPBI and modified nanoparticles are contributed to their higher compatibility [32]. However, in nanocompos-ite membranes prepared from un-modified SiO2 nanoparticles, thedispersionofthenanoparticlesinpolymermatrixis not homogenous and probably aggregation has been formed (Fig. 16(c)).', '@', '@', '@', '@', '4. Conclusion', 'The nanocomposite PPBI-based membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified and un-modified TiO2 and SiO2nanoparticles. The thermal stability of the prepared nanocompos-', 'ite membranes was similar to PPBI membrane. The water uptake of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from TiO2/PSV and SiO2/PSV nanoparticles were higher than other nanocomposite membranes. The acid doping level and proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes in dry conditions obtained from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI nanoparticles were the highest in comparison to PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV. Formation of nanocomposites with modified and un-modified nanoparticles resulted the increas-ing of tensile strengths. The decreasing in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness was widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inor-ganic reinforcement. The high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicated that this membrane could be utilized as a proton exchange membrane for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. M.-G.

Moreover, the dilution condition should be applied to suppress the concurrent chain extension. In consequence, this bimolecular process is now', '@', '@', 'recognized as a less attractive choice for the preparation of cyclic polymers in practice (Scheme 1A).', 'A significantly improved means by an alternative unimolecular process has subsequently been introduced to prepare cyclic polymers (Scheme 1B). It was first demonstrated by using an asymmetrically functional telechelic precursor, a-acetal-u-styryl polystyrene,7 and the subsequent end-to-end polymer cyclization through the deprotection/activation treatment. This unimolecular process with asymmetrically functional telechelic precursors has been extended by employing alternative pairs of the reactive groups. Thus, an a-amino-u-carboxyl polystyrene and poly(tert-butyl acrylate) were prepared through a living polymerization using an initiator having a protected amino group, followed by the end-capping reaction to introduce a carboxylic group.8 The resulting asymmetric telechelic precursor underwent, after the deprotection, an intramolecular amidation reaction to give a ring polymer product effectively. Alternatively, an a-(furan-pro-tected)-maleimide-u-cyclopentadienylpoly(methylmethacry-late) and poly(tert-butyl acrylate) were prepared through the ATRP using a protected maleimide initiator and the subsequent introduction of a cyclopentadienyl group at the living end with the nickelocene methodology.9 The obtained asymmetric tele-chelic precursor was subjected to the heat treatment to cause the spontaneous deprotection followed by an intramolecular Diels–Alder addition reaction to give a ring polymer product effectively.9 It is notable, however, that these processes using telechelic precursors having potentially reactive groups require multistep protection/deprotection treatments.', 'A versatile unimolecular process has recently been introduced by employing a click reaction using asymmetrically functional telechelic polystyrene having an alkyne and an azide group.10 The introduction of these two functional groups at the polymer chain-ends could be performed conveniently, and they can react with each other upon the addition of a Cu catalyst.11 Therefore, this click polymer cyclization has been applied to prepare such functional ring polymers, as poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide)12,13and poly(caprolactone)14 as well as poly(valerolactone)15 to elucidate their topology-effect on phase transition, and on biodegradation, respectively, detailed in the later section. This unimolecular click process has also been employed to construct complex cyclic structures, either having multiple polymer segment components16 or having multicyclic as well as cyclic/ linear hybrid polymer segments.17 On the other hand, the bimo-lecular click process using an azide-ended bifunctional telechelic precursor and a bifunctional alkyne compound as a linking reagentproceedslesseffectivelythantheunimolecular counterpart.18', 'Another effective unimolecular process has been developed using symmetrically functional telechelic precursors, which are readily obtainable through a direct end-capping reaction of living bifunctional polymers (Scheme 1C).18–23 Thus, telechelic poly(tetrahydrofuran), poly(acrylic ester) and poly(isobutene) having olefinic end groups were prepared through the relevant living polymerization followed by the end-capping reaction. The subsequent metathesis condensation, i.e., metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC), in the presence of a Grubbs catalyst pro-ceeded effectively to give the corresponding ring polymers in high yields even under dilution.18–20 This MPC process has further been applied for the practical synthesis of amphiphilic cyclic', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'block copolymers21 as well as of multi-cyclic polymers.22,23 This unimolecular process using symmetrically functional telechelic precursors has been extended by alternative telechelic precursors having either alkyne groups for Glaser condensation or having bromobenzyl groups for a radical coupling process.24,25', 'Ring polymers are obtainable alternatively through a direct ring-expansion polymerization, in which the successive insertion of monomers into a cyclic initiator proceeds to form a ring polymer structure (Scheme 1D). This process does not require dilution in contrast to the end-to-end polymer cyclization process by linear polymer precursors, while a reactive initiator fragment is inherently included in the final ring polymer structure. Thus until recently, the ring-expansion process has been considered as a less practical means, since it is not an easy task to maintain the ring topology of the product while eliminating the initiator residues.26', 'A number of new processes have recently been developed to address this problem in the ring-expansion polymerization (Scheme 2). Thus, a new Ru catalyst bearing a cyclic ligand containing the Ru-alkylidene unit has been introduced and applied for the ring-expansion polymerization of cyclic olefins such as 1,5-cyclooctadiene or cyclooctene.27 During the chain-growth process, the chain transfer to the Ru-alkylidene unit took place to eliminate the initiator complex, and consequently a ring polybutadiene or a ring poly(cyclooctene) free of the catalyst fragment, respectively, is produced. The obtained ring poly(cyclooctene)wasthenhydrogenatedtogivearing polyethylene, showing distinctive properties in comparison with commercial linear polyethylenes (Scheme 2A).27,28 It is notable,', 'at the same time, that the random nature of this chain transfer process inherently causes the broadening of the molecular weight distribution of the product. This process has now been applied with a bulky, dendronized monomer to construct a ring nano-object directly observable by atomic force microscopy (AFM).29', 'More recently, a new N-heterocyclic carbene initiator was introduced for the ring-expansion polymerization of lactones or lactide to form ring polyesters or polylactide, respectively (Scheme 2B).30,31 Remarkably, the obtained ring polymers possess narrow molecular weight distributions through the elimination of the initiator fragment after the quantitative consumption of the monomer, in contrast to the metathesis ring-expansion process shown before.28 By exploiting the living character, this technique has subsequently been applied for the synthesis of ring block polypeptoids and of complex topological polymers having a ring with many branches, i.e., jellyfish poly-mers.32,33 A further development of the ring-expansion process would provide a wider variety of chemical structures in ring polymers by broadening the choice of monomer types.', 'The combination of the classical ring-expansion polymeriza-tion process, in which the initiator fragment is included within the ring polymer structure, with the end-to-end polymer cycli-zation process could provide a new effective means for ring polymers having, in particular, large sizes (Scheme 2C).34 Thus, a ring poly(caprolactone) having short photocrosslinkable block segments was prepared through a sequential living ring-expan-sion polymerization using a cyclic stannate initiator. The subsequent irradiation under dilution caused the intramolecular covalent linking of the two short segments. The subsequent', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'removal of the stannate group produced a chemically stable ring polymer product, though the exact chemical structure of the linking units is obscure.34', 'By employing this methodology, a high-molecular weight ring poly(chloroethyl vinyl ether) was prepared and was subjected to the grafting-onto reaction using a living polystyrene, to form a densely grafted large ring polymer product as a nanoobject, which was directly observable by the AFM.35,36 On the other hand, the AFM showed a large fraction of uncyclized, linear polymer components remained in the crude cyclization products, revealing the inherent difficulty of the end-to-end cyclization of polymer precursors of high molecular weights. It is remarkable, moreover, that a small portion of nanoobjects corresponding to complex ring polymers having tadpole, 8-shaped, catenated and knotted forms were also identified. This showed, for the first time, that not only single-cyclic but also various complex cyclic polymer topologies are indeed produced through the polymer cyclization process, as previously shown in DNA systems.37', 'An electrostatic self-assembly and covalent fixation (ESA-CF) process has been introduced for the effective synthesis of not only cyclic but also functionalized cyclic and multicyclic polymers, where linear or star telechelic polymers having cyclic ammonium salt groups accompanying small or polymeric plurifunctional carboxylate counteranions are employed as key precursors (Scheme 1E).38–40 Various telechelic polymers have been conve-niently prepared through the relevant living polymerization fol-lowed by the end-capping/end-conversion technique. The choice of such particular types of cyclic ammonium salt end groups as five- and six-membered cyclic ammonium, i.e., N-phenyl-pyrrolidinium and N-phenylpiperidinium salt groups, respec-tively, is of a crucial importance in the ESA-CF process (Scheme 3).41 The former undergoes upon heating a selective ring-opening reaction by a carboxylate counteranion to form an amino ester group through the nucleophilic attack exclusively at the N-adjacent ring (endo) position. On the other hand, the latter having unstrained six-membered cyclic ammonium salt groups gives a chemically more stable, simple ester group through the nucleophilic attack at the alternative N-adjacent (exo) position, to eliminate N-phenylpiperidine.', 'And in the electrostatic polymer self-assembly, the cations at the end of the telechelics and the anions in the carboxylates counteranions always balance the charges. Upon the dilution, the self-assembly tends to dissociate into one having the smallest number of polymer components by keeping the balance of the charges (Scheme 4). Thus, when a self-assembly comprised of', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'a linear telechelic precursor, typically poly(THF), having cyclic ammonium salt groups accompanying either a dicarboxylate or a tetracarboxylate counteranion was heated at dilution, the selective ring-opening reaction of the cyclic ammonium groups took place to produce single-cyclic (ring) or dicyclic (8-shaped) polymerproducts,respectively,inhighyields.38,42Ring poly(THF)s having the molecular weights of up to 10 000, cor-responding to the ring size of as high as 700 atoms, were obtainable and characterized unequivocally by the MALDI-TOF mass technique. Furthermore, the ESA-CF process with dynamic equilibrium nature has been exploited to construct various multicyclic as well as cyclic-linear hybrid polymer topologies (Scheme 5).6', 'Moreover, ring polymers possessing the prescribed functional groups at the designated positions, i.e., kyklo-telechelics and cyclic macromonomer, have also been prepared by employing telechelic precursors possessing such functional groups as hydroxyl, olefinic, acetylenic, and azide groups at the designated, typically a center, position by using the relevant initiator, or by introducing functional linking reagents.43 They were subse-quently applied to construct more complex polymer topologies either through the covalent linkage or even through the non-covalent, mechanical linkage uniquely formed by threading with ring polymer units.44,45 It was also shown that network polymers formed from cyclic polymer precursors exhibited unique gel properties compared with conventional gels obtained with linear/ branched polymer precursors.46 Moreover, the topological conversion of polymers between ring/linear and even between single-cyclic/dicyclic topologies has now been achieved.45,47,48', 'By the combination of the ESA-CF protocol with selective covalent linking chemistry, a wide variety of multi-cyclic as well as cyclic-linear conjugated polymers have been synthesized.49 In particular, the combination of the ESA-CF process with the metathesis condensation and with the click process has now been revealed as a versatile means to construct a variety of complex multicyclic polymer topologies of fused-, spiro- and bridged forms (Scheme 6).50 Both the functional ring polymer precursors and thecovalentlylinkedmulticyclicpolymerproductwere unequivocally characterized by means of a series of spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques including MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy and SEC. As shown in Fig. 1, for a typical example, the structure of the polymer products having complex multicyclic topologies is convincingly demonstrated. The ESA-CF process has further been applied for the effective synthesis of topologi-cally unique polymer catenanes comprised of large polymer', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'rings51 through the two orthogonal non-covalent interactions, namely the electrostatic and the hydrogen-bond interactions (Scheme 5).45', '3.Topology effects by cyclic polymers: depleting the chain-ends and beyond', 'In contrast to linear or branched polymer topologies, ring polymer topologies are uniquely defined by their absence of the chain ends.3,5 As recognized by the typical case of glass transition temperature (Tg), the topology effect of ring polymers is thus arisen from the depletion of the end-groups of polymer segments. Thus, the Tg of ring polymers is higher than the linear counter-part, until the polymer chain length becomes long enough to diminish the contribution of the chain end. On the contrary, the hydrodynamic volume or the melt viscosity of ring polymers is inherently smaller than their linear counterparts irrespective of their chain lengths. This indicates the distinctive conception in the topology effect by ring polymers. The latter is regarded as an inherent topology effect by ring polymers, while the former as the depletion effect of the polymer chain ends. Nevertheless, the elimination of the chain ends of polymer molecules inevitably leads to the formation of cyclic constructions to bring the topology effect, now drawing increasing interests to discover unusual properties and functions in polymer materials covering mechanical, thermal, electric, photonic and bio-related applica-tions either in bulk or at surface. From an experimental point of', 'view, moreover, further developments are awaited to provide ring polymers possessing high molecular weights with guaran-teed purity, since the mixing of even small amount of linear counterpartmightcauseinconclusiveorevenerroneous conclusions on the topology effect by ring polymers.', '4.Topology effects on basic polymer properties: simulations and experiments from simple to complex cyclic polymers', 'Basic characteristics of single-cyclic (ring) homopolymers either in solution or bulk, in static or dynamic states, have extensively been studied and documented relevantly.3 Therefore, recent studies have elaborated either on specific polymers of practical importance like polyethylenes,52 on specific chain characteristics like semiflexible to stiff nature,53 or on multicomponent polymer systemstypicallyblockcopolymers.54Notably,moreover, theory and simulation studies have increasingly focused on multi-cyclic complex polymers, obviously promoted by synthetic developments on complex topological polymers.55–57 Unique topological polymer properties envisaged by the simulation studies are now to be verified experimentally using relevant topological polymers. Indeed, a collaborative simulation and experimental study on the liquid chromatography study has been conducted on multi-cyclic polymers, and could provide a basis for the purification and the characterization of polymers having complex topologies.58', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The diffusion behavior is of particular interest in view of the topology effects on polymer molecules, since the self-diffusion of linear and branched polymers follows the reptation mechanism, a snake-like translational motion, in which the polymer chain ends tend to command the motion of their in-chain segments.59Cyclic polymers are unique, on the other hand, in the absence of chain ends, and their non-reptation dynamics has been a subject of both theory/simulation and experimental studies.60', 'A single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy is a unique means to observe directlythe motion of single polymer molecules.61 Thus, the ESA-CF process was applied with mono- and bifunctional telechelic poly(THF) precursors having N-phenylpiperidinium (six-membered ring) groups possessing a perylene dicarboxylate counteranion, to produce ring and linear poly(THF)s having a perylene unit applicable to the single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy measurement (Scheme 7).62', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The subsequent single-molecule imaging was conducted to observe the real-time motion of individual polymer molecules.

The histograms of the distribution of the individual diffusion constant were subsequently obtained from large enough datasets of these consecutive images. Upon the statistical analysis of the distribution patterns, a bimodal diffu-sion mechanism was disclosed for ring polymers, corresponding to either threaded or non-threaded conditions in a linear mole-cule matrix. In contrast, the unimodal diffusion was indicated for the linear counterpart (Fig. 3).', 'As shown above, the significant topology effects could be envisaged in polymer properties involving their diffusion process.

To elucidate the topology effect in the crystallization process, a defect-free ring poly(THF) was prepared together with the linear counterpart having the precisely relevant chemical structure.63 Thus, a living bifunctional poly(THF) was terminated with sodium allyloxide to give a telechelic precursor having allyl end groups. The subsequent metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC) with a Grubbs catalyst under dilution, followed by the hydrogenation of the unsaturated linking group afforded a defect-free ring poly(THF), consisting exclusively of oxytetramethylene units (Scheme 8). The isothermal crystallization experiments showed the slower crystallization rate for ring poly(THF)s ascribed to their topologically constrained conformation (Fig. 4). Moreover,', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'distinctive crystal morphologies are produced, in particular a banded structure in the spherulites exclusively for the ring poly (THF) but not for the linear counterpart. The crystallization kinetics of ring poly(3-caprolactone)s has recently been reported by several groups.64 The faster crystallization rate was observed for ring polymers than the linear counterpart in contrast to the case of poly(THF), and was ascribed to the higher diffusion of ring polymers than their linear counterparts.64', '5.Topology effects by ring polymers in self-assemblies', 'The topology effects by ring polymers could be amplified in their assembled states rather than in their individually separated forms. Therefore, micelles formed by ring polymers should be of a remarkable interest. Thus, a series of micelles were prepared with amphiphilic cyclic AB block copolymers, comprised of eitherpoly(butyleneoxide)/poly(ethyleneoxide)orpoly (propylene oxide)/poly(ethylene oxide), together with their linear AB, linear ABA block copolymer counterparts.65–67 The cyclic block copolymer employed in this study was prepared by a bimolecular process using the hydroxy-terminated linear block copolymer and dichloromethane as a linking reagent in the presence of KOH, to form an acetal linking unit (Scheme 9A).', 'The critical micelle concentration (cmc) of the micelle with the cyclic AB block copolymer was similar to or marginally smaller than those with the linear ABA counterparts. On the contrary, the corresponding micelle with the linear AB counterpart showed a significantly smaller cmc. Moreover, the association number', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '(Nw), thermodynamic radius (rt), and hydrodynamic radius (rh) of the micelle with the cyclic AB block copolymers and with the linear ABA counterparts were comparable to each other, but distinctively smaller than those with the linear AB counterparts. These results are consistent with the geometric estimation of the size of the micelles, corresponding to the Nw, rt, and rh, which is dependent on the continuous chain length of the hydrophobic segment in the block copolymers. And, those in the cyclic AB and the linear ABA block copolymers are estimated as a half of that in the linear AB counterpart employed in this study. Moreover, the cyclic AB block copolymer tends to constitute a stiff hairpin-like conformation, resulting in a slightly larger hydrophobic core within the micelle compared to that with the linear ABA coun-terpart having free chain ends. The enthalpy of micellization (DmicH�) was also smaller with the cyclic AB block copolymer than that with the corresponding linear ABA counterpart, presumably because the segmental flip-flop is inhibited in the micelle with the former, in contrast to the motional freedom by the latter having free chain ends. This also agrees with the smaller entropy of micellization (DmicS�) with the cyclic AB block copolymer than with the linear counterpart.', 'More recently, a significant topology effect has been revealed in the thermal stability of the micelle formed with cyclic AB block copolymers in comparison with the linear ABA and even with the linear AB counterparts.68 Notably, a variety of relevant cyclic lipids, thus a type of surfactants, have been discovered in the cell membrane of thermophilic archaea, single-cell microorganisms, surviving in the hostile environment of very high-temperatures located at hot springs and submarine volcanoes.69 Thus, an amphiphilic cyclic AB block copolymer, comprised of poly(butyl acrylate)/poly(ethylene oxide) segments, was prepared. The unimolecular, metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC) process was employed using a linear ABA block copolymer precursor having olefinic end groups (Scheme 9B).21', 'The obtained cyclic and the relevant linear block copolymers were allowed to form the corresponding micelles, in which their cmc’s and the number-average hydrodynamic volumes (Dh) were measured to be closely comparable to each other (Fig. 5).68 The size and morphology of the micelles with either block copolymers were directly observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 6) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 6) to show commonly flower-like spherical shapes possessing the consistent diameters determined by DLS (Scheme 10).', 'Remarkably, the thermal stability of the micelles was drasti-cally enhanced using the cyclic block copolymer. Thus, the', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'corresponding micelle solutions were heated from 20�C in a stepwise fashion (Fig. 7), and the micelle with the linear ABA block copolymer became turbid at around 25 �C, while that with the cyclic AB counterpart was stable till above 70 �C.68', 'Based on the large deviation of the clouding point (Tc) among the micelles either solely with cyclic or with linear block copol-ymers, the tuning of the Tc of the micelle was achieved by the coassembly of both the linear and cyclic block copolymers.68Thus, the Tc was systematically altered along with the relative contents of the cyclic and the linear block copolymer compo-nents in the micelle, as shown in Fig. 7.68 This topology effect will be utilized to design temperature-responsive devices encapsu-lating and releasing appropriate components in and from the micelle.

A number of recent studies are presented in this section, covering a diverse field either by conjugated cyclic oligomers,70 by photo-responsive ring polymers,71,72 by biodegradable ring polyesters,14by temperature-responsive ring polymers,12,13or by pharmaco-logically functional ring polymers.73', 'Conjugated polymers and oligomers have currently been extensively studied primarily due to their potential for diverse electronic and photonic applications.74 Ring-shaped conjugated polymers and oligomers have attracted particular interests as a prototype of the molecularly fabricated electric circuit, since the circulation of electrons/holes might be induced along the ‘‘endless’’ conjugated segments. A wide variety of conjugated ring oligomers possessing the increasing numbers of unsaturated groups have thus been prepared to test their electrochemical properties.70 Fully conjugated large ring polymers, on the other hand, have still been an elusive synthetic challenge. It is notable, moreover, that a twisted, Moebius stripe-like conjugated olig-omer has attracted considerable interests because of their unusual non-H€uckel aromaticity, in contrast to the conventional H€uckel-type aromaticity which is dependent on its planar geometry by conjugated units.75', 'Photo-response behaviors could be influenced by polymer topologies of either ring or linear forms. Thus, a ring polymer having photo-responsive azobenzene units in the main chain was prepared through the bimolecular end-to-end cyclization via click chemistry.71 Upon the irradiation of UV light, both the trans-to-cis and the cis-to-trans isomerization proceeded slightly faster by the ring polymer in comparison with the linear counterpart. This behavior was attributed to the higher topo-logical constraint of the former than the latter counterpart.71 As another example, a ring polystyrene having two photoactive groups, namely fluorene and anthracene units, was prepared through the bimolecular process using a living bifunctional polystyrene produced with an initiator having a fluorene unit and a linking reagent having an anthracene unit.72 The fluo-rescent behavior of the obtained ring polymer was subsequently studied to show the intramolecular energy migration between the two chromophores.72', 'Naturally occurring ring polymers, such as cyclic DNAs, cyclic peptides as well as cyclic polysaccharides,3 and multi-cyclic counterparts like cyclotides,76 are known to exhibit higher stability against biologically induced decomposition. In this relevance, the topology effect of aliphatic biodegradable poly-esters on their decomposition behavior has been investigated.14Thus, ring poly(caprolactone) was prepared through the unim-olecular click polymer cyclization using the corresponding precursor having an azide and an alkyne group. The higher hydrolytic stability was then observed in comparison with the linear counterparts.14 Notably, moreover, such biodegradable ring polyesters by poly(valerolactone) and by poly(lactide) were also prepared.15,30,31,77', 'Temperature-responsivepropertiesofpoly(N-iso-propylacrylamide), poly(NIPAM), have extensively been studied for their eventual uses in the controlled release devices and for the cell–sheet applications.78 The two groups recently reported the topology effects by ring poly(NIPAM)s.12,13 Thus, the two groups prepared linear poly(NIPAM) precursors having alkyne and azide end groups either by a reversible addition–fragmen-tation chain transfer (RAFT) or by an atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) technique, and the unimolecular click process was commonly applied for the subsequent polymer cyclization. The cloud point (TCP) of the obtained ring poly(NIPAM) by one group was several degrees higher than that of the corresponding linear counterpart. In addition, they observed that the phase transition by the ring polymers took place distinctively slower upon heating.12 Another group, on the other hand, observed the ring poly(NIPAM) showing a few degrees lower TCP against the linear counterpart at the higher solution concentration, while higher at the lower solution concentration. Furthermore, they reported the smaller enthalpy change (DH) during the phase transition with the ring poly (NIPAM). These results were accounted for by the suppression of the hydrogen bond interaction between the ring poly(NIPAM) with water molecules due to their topological constraints in comparison with the flexible linear counterpart having free chain ends.13', 'A pharmacological application of ring polymers has recently been demonstrated by elucidating the filtration/elimination mechanism of a kidney through its nanoporous channel.73 Thus, it was anticipated that the ring polymer could remain longer in a body than the linear counterpart, since the former should be reluctant to transform its conformation into a folded shape to traverse through the nanoporous channels of the kidney.73 To test this topology effect, a series of linear and cyclic poly(capro-lactone)s having poly(ethylene glycol) graft segments and having phenolic functionalities for radiolabeling by 125I were prepared. The lower secretion into urine and in turn the higher accumu-lation in various organs was indeed confirmed with the ring polymer having an appropriate molecular weight, corresponding to its hydrodynamic volume.73 These findings may provide new design methodologies for drug carriers and imaging agents via the topology-based control of a blood circulation time.', '7.Conclusions and future perspectives', 'In this review, we have shown a variety of recent achievements in topological polymer chemistry, to focus on novel polymer', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'properties and functions uniquely revealed by ring polymers.

Host–guest interaction between a β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) terminated hydrophilicpolymer and curcumin is employed to formulate stable nanosized aggregates. A redox-sensitive disulfide linkage is used to tether the CD moiety onto the polymer chain ends to obtain efficient release insidecancerous cells. For the synthesis of the β-CD terminated redox-responsive polymer, a polyethyleneglycol (PEG)-based polymer containing a benzothiazole-disulfide (BDS) group at the chain end was uti-lized. The BDS-terminated polymers were synthesized using reversible addition–fragmentation chaintransfer (RAFT) polymerization by using a BDS-containing chain-transfer agent (CTA). Initially, the post-polymerization modification abilities of these polymers were demonstrated by successful conjugation of model thiol functional compounds such as furfuryl thiol and Bodipy-SH, a fluorescent hydrophobic dye.To prepare a nanoaggregate forming polymer precursor, a thiol functional β-CD host moiety was conju-gated to the BDS end groups of the reactive polymer through redox-responsive disulfide linkage for-mation. The other end of the β-CD-containing polymer was capped with an integrin-targeting cyclicpeptide (cRGDfK). While no aggregates were observed in the aqueous medium for the BDS-containingparent polymer, the β-CD attached polymers gave nanosized aggregates with average sizes below 150 nm. Curcumin-loaded nanoaggregates were obtained through the inclusion complexation of curcu-min molecules with β-CD moieties. It was shown that enhanced drug release occurred upon exposure ofthe nanoaggregates to the glutathione (GSH) environment. While the parent BDS functional polymers and β-CD-containing polymeric aggregates were non-toxic to healthy fibroblast cells, curcumin-loadedaggregates showed dose-dependent toxicity against the U-87 glioblastoma cancer cell line. The peptide-targeting group containing nanoparticles showed slightly higher toxicity and enhanced cellular internaliz-ation. The modular nanoparticle system disclosed here could be employed to address challenges in thedelivery of hydrophobic drugs to cancer cells.', 'Introduction', 'The utilization of nanosized polymeric drug delivery agents such as micelles, nanoparticles, and nanogels continues to play an ever-increasing role in providing a viable solution to', 'challenges in the delivery of hydrophobic anti-cancer drugs.1–5Apart from solubilizing the drug, the polymeric constructs provide a biocompatible platform for protecting drugs from premature degradation and improving their circulation time in vivo. Furthermore, polymer-based delivery systems allow for targeted drug delivery through appropriate functionalization with specific ligands such as peptides, antibodies or bioactive small molecules to target disease cells, thus minimizing off target effects and enhancing therapeutic outcomes. The efficient solubilization of hydrophobic drugs plays an impor-tant role since many effective anticancer compounds will be ruled out because of their low bioavailability. One such hydrophobic anticancer compound is curcumin, a naturally occurring polyphenol derived from turmeric, which exhibits', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'remarkable anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties.6–10 Despite its therapeutic potential, curcumin’s clinical utility is limited by its poor aqueous solubility, com-promising its bioavailability and effectiveness.', 'Commonly used approaches for fabricating polymer-based micellar carriers utilize block copolymers, which assemble into nanosized aggregates in aqueous media and thus encap-sulate the hydrophobic drugs in their interior. Although the past years have seen remarkable advances in the synthesis of block copolymers, their synthesis is still not trivial. Instead of using a hydrophobic second block, we envisioned employing a host moiety to encapsulate the hydrophobic drug and increase hydrophobic interactions leading to micellar aggregates. For this purpose, beta-cyclodextrin (β-CD), a cyclic oligosaccharide composed of glucose units, emerges as a viable candidate. It is well established that β-CD is a valuable excipient for enhancing the solubility and bioavailability of hydrophobic drugs.11–14Previous studies have demonstrated β-CD’s utility in enhan-cing curcumin’s solubility and stability, making it an ideal candidate for formulating curcumin-based therapeutics.14–21However, most of these studies solubilize curcumin in mole-cular form. Thus, the size of the complex usually falls much below the domain of nanosize necessary for drug delivery with passive targeting mediated by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.22 Apart from using CDs in molecular form, a variety of macromolecular constructs with CDs have been reported,23–25 To date, the CD moiety has been conju-gated to the chain end,26,27 as side chain residues,28 or utilized as a core motif in star-like multiarm polymers.29 In most cases, the CD moiety is non-reversibly conjugated to the poly-meric scaffolds, and thus, the encapsulated guest molecule is releasedpredominantlybyreversiblehost–guest interactions.30,31 In this study, we aimed for conjugation with a disulfide-based reversible linkage so that the encapsulated hydrophobic guest molecule remains soluble upon release from the polymer-based aggregate.', 'In recent years, it has been established that the incorpor-ation of redox-responsive linkage in the drug delivery platform further enhances the cytotoxicity in cancerous cells with increased levels of glutathione (GSH).32–39 Thus, we targeted constructing a hydrophilic polymer containing a chain end β-CD unit linked with a redox-responsive linker. To obtain such a polymer in a modular fashion, we envisioned that a thiol–disulfide exchange using a benzothiazole disulfide (BDS) chain-terminated polymer could be utilized. The BDS group is known to undergo the thiol–disulfide exchange reaction with high efficiency, and we recently employed it for the functionali-zation of side chain residues of polymers, polymer-coated sur-faces and hydrogels.40–44 Until now, the usage of the BDS group as a thiol-reactive group on a polymer chain end has remained unexplored. The present work demonstrates the ver-satility of polymers containing the BDS group as a chain end moiety, along with demonstrating their utilization for obtain-ing β-CD-terminated polymers.', 'Herein, we aimed to fabricate curcumin-loaded micellar nanoparticles using a redox-responsive polymeric construct in', 'which the CD moiety is linked to the end of the polymer chain through a redox-responsive disulfide linkage (Scheme 1). We employed a BDS-based linker at the chain end of a PEG-based hydrophilic polymer to obtain such constructs in a modular fashion. We report here the synthesis and functionalization of BDS group terminated polymers and show that the CD moiety could be efficiently added to the polymer chain end through a redox-responsive disulfide linkage. Thus the obtained β-CD-containing polymers are used to fabricate drug-loaded aggre-gates upon complexation with curcumin. It is also demon-strated that peptide-based cell targeting groups can be incor-porated at the other chain end of the β-CD-containing polymer. Drug loading and release studies, as well as cyto-toxicity and cellular internalization studies, suggest these poly-mers as promising candidates for the delivery of curcumin. Although the study here is undertaken with curcumin, one could expect that the modular approach reported here could be adapted for the delivery of other hydrophobic drugs to can-cerous cells in a targeted fashion.', 'Experimental section', 'Materials', 'Poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMEMA, Mn = 300 gmol−1) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used after purification through activated aluminum oxide filtration.

Next, the anti-cancer potential of curcumin-loaded nanoparticles was investigated using the U-87 cancer cell line.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Notably, nanoparticles conjugated with cRGDfK displayed sig-nificantly higher cytotoxicity at concentrations of 45 µg mL−1and 4.5 µg mL−1 compared to non-targeted nanoparticles (Fig. 9b). This enhanced cell death suggests that the cRGDfK moiety effectively targets the nanoparticles to U-87 cancer cells, facilitating greater curcumin internalization. An in vitro cellular internalization experiment on U-87 cells was con-ducted to compare both targeting group-containing and non-targeted nanoparticles. Confocal microscopy and flow cytome-try analyses confirmed that targeted nanoparticles were inter-nalized more than non-targeted ones, highlighting the impor-tant role of the cRGDfK peptide for enhanced cellular uptake', '(Fig. 10). To confirm receptor-mediated internalization of the targeted nanoparticles, a competitive inhibition assay was per-formed using the cRGDfV peptide, which exhibits a higher affinity for integrin receptors. The addition of cRGDfV reduced nanoparticle internalization compared to the targeted nano-particles alone, as evidenced by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry, supporting the hypothesis of receptor-mediated uptake. To further elucidate the internalization mechanism, experiments were conducted at 37 °C and 4 °C to investigate the involvement of energy-dependent processes. At 37 °C, a substantially higher fluorescence signal was observed in the cytoplasm, indicative of active endocytosis. In contrast, nano-', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'particle internalization was significantly compromised at 4 °C, a temperature that inhibits energy-dependent cellular pro-cesses. Flow cytometry analysis also suggested similar trends. This temperature-dependent uptake strongly suggests that the internalization of targeted nanoparticles is an energy-depen-dentprocessdrivenbyactivetransportmechanisms (Fig. S10†).', 'Conclusion', 'Insummary,polymersthatundergofacilechain-end functionalization through a redox-responsive disulfide linkage using the BDS group are reported. A CTA containing the BDS group is synthesized and utilized to obtain thiol-reactive poly-mers using RAFT polymerization. Facile chain-end functionali-zation through various thiol-containing molecules is demon-strated. Polymers containing CD units at chain ends linked through disulfide linkages are obtained. The other chain end is modified to install a peptide-based cancer cell targeting unit. The self-assembly of these polymers in the presence of curcumin yields drug-loaded micellar nanoparticles. Drug loading and release studies, as well as cytotoxicity and cellular internalization studies, suggest that these CD-containing poly-mers are promising candidates for the delivery of curcumin. Importantly, the CD-containing redox-responsive polymeric system here is demonstrated for solubilization and targeted cellular delivery of curcumin; other hydrophobic drugs and desired targeting motifs can be incorporated due to the modular nature of the construct.', '7 T.

China', '(Received: 21 May, 2007; published: 10 September, 2007)', 'Abstract: We reported a chemical approach for the in-situ preparation of  conducting polyaniline (PANI)/Fe2O3 composite dispersions using dodecylbenzene  sulfonic (DBSA) acid both as dopant and surfactant. The PANI/Fe2O3 composite  dispersions were characterized by X-ray diffraction, UV-vis and FT-IR spectra and  conductivity measurement. The dispersions showed good stability and existed  without precipitate for at least half a year. The gas-sensing behavior of the  composite film to 100 ppm of NH3 was studied through monitoring the change of  the resistance.', 'Keywords: PANI/Fe2O3 composite, dispersions, dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid', 'Introduction', 'Recently, polymeric composites containing metal oxides have attracted a great deal  of attention from researchers because they frequently exhibit unexpected hybrid  properties synergistically derived from both components [1-4]. Meanwhile, they  exhibit interesting properties with many applications such as quantum electronic  devices, gas sensors, capacitors, conducting paints and rechargeable batteries [5-8].  Composites of polyaniline (PANI) have been widely studied in view of their unique  electrical, dielectrical, optical and optoelectrical properties in addition to their easy  preparation and excellent environmental stability [9-12]. However, the poor solubility  limits their application as conducting materials. To overcome this obstacle,  functionalized protonic acids such as dedecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) or  camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) have been used to dope PANI and the obtained  conducting products were soluble in many kinds of solvents [13-14].', 'On the other hand, composite of PANI and iron oxides (Fe2O3 or Fe3O4) has been  extensively investigated because of their unique magnetic properties and application  prospects in technology [15-24]. But most of the composites were in powder state;  therefore, the processes to prepare film for application in devices are complicated. In  our experiment, we prepare the conducting PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions in  aqueous solution by one step, and the so-obtained PANI/Fe2O3 composite  dispersions can be directly used to prepare conducting films and hence make  different devices.', 'In our former work, we have investigated the formation of the PANI dispersions under  different preparation conductions by changing the concentration of surfactant, aniline,  acid and the ratio of aniline to ammonium persulphate (APS) [25]. In this study, we', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'chose the optimum conditions considering the above factors to prepare the  PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions by in-situ polymerization using DBSA both as  dopant and surfactant. The dispersions of PANI/Fe2O3 composite could exist without  any precipitate for at least half a year. In addition, it can be diluted by distilled water  for many times without generation of precipitate, indicating their high stability or  nearly solution characteristic. The structure and conductivity of the composite was  studied by X-ray, UV-vis and FT-IR spectra, and four-probe technology. The gas-sensing behavior of the film prepared by directly spinning the dispersions on silicon  chip was studied.', 'Results and discussion', 'Formation', 'As for the formation of the dispersions, we assumed that the Fe2O3 particles were  dispersed in water aqueous solution and it would act as ‘seed’ to induce the  polymerization of aniline. In our experiment, the Fe2O3 particles were homogeneously  dispersed in the reaction system because DBSA with hydrophilic group acted as  surfactant. Then the aniline monomer contacted with Fe2O3 nearly at the same time,  which could accelerate the induction time of polymerization [26]. This effect could be  observed by monitoring the change of the solution temperature as shown in Fig. 1.  From Fig. 1, we can see that the time for the seed polymerization to start was about  300 s (Fig. 1b) while without Fe2O3 particles was about 3300 s along (Fig. 1a).', '@', '@', 'XRD pattern', 'The XRD pattern of PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions is shown in Fig. 2.

The peak  at 351 nm arises from π-π* electron transition within benzenoid segments, the peak  at 436 nm is due to the polaron state and the wide peak at 757 nm is related to the  doping level [28]. Compared to the PANI dispersions, the absorption peak of  PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions show little difference, for example, the peak at  757 nm shifts to 746 nm (Fig. 3b). The shift may be originated from the decreasing  doping level by the addition of Fe2O3.', 'FT-IR spectra', 'The FT-IR spectra of PANI and PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions are shown in Fig.  4. From Fig. 4a, we can find the characteristic peaks of PANI: the peak at 684 cm-1 is  usually assigned to the C-H out of plane bending in 1, 2 ring in intrinsic PANI; the  peak at 1083 cm-1 stands for the C-H aromatic in-plane bending on 1, 4 ring; the  peak at 1183 cm-1 may be assigned to the carbon skeleton, and the peak of 1311 cm-1 is contributed to C-N stretching mode. The strong peak at 1459 cm-1 is related to  C=C stretching mode of the benzenoid ring and a weak peak of quionoid ring at 1548  cm-1 means the high doping degree of the PANI [29]. And from Fig. 4b, we can see  that when the Fe2O3 particles present in the dispersion, the intensity of the peak at  1459 cm-1 is decreased and shift to 1461 cm-1, which represents the decrease of  doping degree of the PANI. There may be some interaction between the lone pair  electrons of N atom in PANI chains with 3d orbit of Fe atom, which could reduce the  energy level interval of aromatic nucleus. This also caused the UV-vis absorption  band of composite dispersions to have a red shift [30].', '@', '@', 'Conductivity', 'Table 1 shows the conductivity values measured by using four-probe technology at  25 0C. Compared to pure PANI, the conductivity of PANI/Fe2O3 composite with Fe2O3  content of 0.05 g increases from 0.98 to 1.07μS/cm. This may be attributed to the  doping effect associated with Fe2O3 particles that are believed to help induce the  formation of a more efficient network for change transport, thus enhancing the', '@', 'conductivity of the composite [31]. However, with increasing the content of Fe2O3, the  relative contents of the conducting polymer are decreased, resulting in the decrease  of the corresponding conductivity. The decrease may be attributed to two factors: (a)  the insulating behavior of the Fe2O3 particles in the core of the composites; (b) a  decrease of doping degree as the UV-vis and FT-IR spectra show [32].', '@', '@', 'Gas-sensing behavior', 'The gas-sensing behavior of PANI/Fe2O3 composite film to 100 ppm of NH3 is shown  in Fig. 5. The y-axis is the normalized resistance (R- R0/R0), where R0 is the initial  resistance of the composite film before exposure to NH3 at t = 0 and R is the time  dependent resistance of the film exposed to the test gas.', '@', '@', 'From Fig. 5 we could see that the composite film has a significant sensitivity to NH3.  The response time of the composite film is 40 s. It can be applied to the detection of  ammonia, and the further study of the sensitivity to NH3 and other gases is under  way.', '@', 'Stability', 'The stability of the dispersions with different content of Fe2O3 particles was studied.  When the content of Fe2O3 particles in the dispersions was lower than 0.05 g, the  dispersions show good stability and existed without precipitate at least half a year.  However, when the content was beyond 0.05 g, there were some precipitates on the  bottom of the dispersion and the quantity of the precipitates increased with the  content of Fe2O3.', 'Conclusions', 'PANI/Fe2O3 dispersions were prepared using DBSA both as dopant and surfactant.  The XRD, UV-vis and FT-IR characterization indicated that there is some interaction  between the PANI and Fe2O3. The conductivity of the dispersions increased when a  little of Fe2O3 particles were added and decreased in line when a great quantity of  Fe2O3 were added. The dispersions showed good stability and existed without  precipitate for at least half a year. A film were prepared by directly spinning the  PANI/Fe2O3 dispersions on a chip of silicon to study the gas-sensing of100ppm NH3;  the response time is only 40 s and further study of the sensitivity to the NH3 is under  way.', 'Experimental', 'Materials', 'Aniline was freshly distilled under reduced pressure and other chemicals were used  as received without further purification. Fe2O3 particles were synthesized by  coprecipitation.', 'Preparation of PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersion', 'PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions were prepared using an in-situ polymerization  method. A typical experiment was done as follows: 0.465 g of aniline was dispersed  into 100 ml of DBSA aqueous solution (0.2 M) under stirring, after which 0.1 g of  Fe2O3 was added into the above solution under ultrasonic. APS in powder state was  then added into the mixture solution. The dispersions of PANI/Fe2O3 composite were  obtained after stirring for 1 h. The PANI dispersions were prepared by the same  approach in absence of Fe2O3. Acetone damaging dispersions were centrifuged and  washed with distilled water, ethanol and acetone three times, respectively. The  resulting powder were dried under reduced pressure at room temperature and then  used for XRD and conductivity measurements.', 'Characterization', 'The composite dispersions was spun onto a chip of silicon and dried under 60 oC in  order to remove the solvent and form a film for the UV-vis and FT-IR spectra  measurement and study NH3 gas-sensing behavior. UV-vis and FT-IR spectra were  recorded on a UV 3100 spectrometer and on FT-IR-8400s (Shimadzu) spectrometer,  respectively. The conductivity measurements were made by the conventional four-probe (SDY-5) method on pressed pellets of the composite powders prepared at  ambient temperature (25 oC). The gas-sensing behavior, which could be reflected by  the resistance change of the resulting PANI/Fe2O3 composite film upon exposure to  100 ppm of NH3, was monitored with a digital multimeter (DT9205).', '@', 'References', '[1] Su S.J.; Kuramoto N.
