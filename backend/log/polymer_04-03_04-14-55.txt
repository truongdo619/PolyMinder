Moreover, the dilution condition should be applied to suppress the concurrent chain extension. In consequence, this bimolecular process is now recognized as a less attractive choice for the preparation of cyclic polymers in practice (Scheme 1A).', '@', '@', 'A significantly improved means by an alternative unimolecular process has subsequently been introduced to prepare cyclic polymers (Scheme 1B). It was first demonstrated by using an asymmetrically functional telechelic precursor, a-acetal-u-styryl polystyrene,7 and the subsequent end-to-end polymer cyclization through the deprotection/activation treatment. This unimolecular process with asymmetrically functional telechelic precursors has been extended by employing alternative pairs of the reactive groups. Thus, an a-amino-u-carboxyl polystyrene and poly(tert-butyl acrylate) were prepared through a living polymerization using an initiator having a protected amino group, followed by the end-capping reaction to introduce a carboxylic group.8 The resulting asymmetric telechelic precursor underwent, after the deprotection, an intramolecular amidation reaction to give a ring polymer product effectively. Alternatively, an a-(furan-pro-tected)-maleimide-u-cyclopentadienylpoly(methylmethacry-late) and poly(tert-butyl acrylate) were prepared through the ATRP using a protected maleimide initiator and the subsequent introduction of a cyclopentadienyl group at the living end with the nickelocene methodology.9 The obtained asymmetric tele-chelic precursor was subjected to the heat treatment to cause the spontaneous deprotection followed by an intramolecular Diels–Alder addition reaction to give a ring polymer product effectively.9 It is notable, however, that these processes using telechelic precursors having potentially reactive groups require multistep protection/deprotection treatments.', 'A versatile unimolecular process has recently been introduced by employing a click reaction using asymmetrically functional telechelic polystyrene having an alkyne and an azide group.10 The introduction of these two functional groups at the polymer chain-ends could be performed conveniently, and they can react with each other upon the addition of a Cu catalyst.11 Therefore, this click polymer cyclization has been applied to prepare such functional ring polymers, as poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide)12,13and poly(caprolactone)14 as well as poly(valerolactone)15 to elucidate their topology-effect on phase transition, and on biodegradation, respectively, detailed in the later section. This unimolecular click process has also been employed to construct complex cyclic structures, either having multiple polymer segment components16 or having multicyclic as well as cyclic/ linear hybrid polymer segments.17 On the other hand, the bimo-lecular click process using an azide-ended bifunctional telechelic precursor and a bifunctional alkyne compound as a linking reagentproceedslesseffectivelythantheunimolecular counterpart.18', 'Another effective unimolecular process has been developed using symmetrically functional telechelic precursors, which are readily obtainable through a direct end-capping reaction of living bifunctional polymers (Scheme 1C).18–23 Thus, telechelic poly(tetrahydrofuran), poly(acrylic ester) and poly(isobutene) having olefinic end groups were prepared through the relevant living polymerization followed by the end-capping reaction. The subsequent metathesis condensation, i.e., metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC), in the presence of a Grubbs catalyst pro-ceeded effectively to give the corresponding ring polymers in high yields even under dilution.18–20 This MPC process has further been applied for the practical synthesis of amphiphilic cyclic block copolymers21 as well as of multi-cyclic polymers.22,23 This unimolecular process using symmetrically functional telechelic precursors has been extended by alternative telechelic precursors having either alkyne groups for Glaser condensation or having bromobenzyl groups for a radical coupling process.24,25', 'Ring polymers are obtainable alternatively through a direct ring-expansion polymerization, in which the successive insertion of monomers into a cyclic initiator proceeds to form a ring polymer structure (Scheme 1D). This process does not require dilution in contrast to the end-to-end polymer cyclization process by linear polymer precursors, while a reactive initiator fragment is inherently included in the final ring polymer structure. Thus until recently, the ring-expansion process has been considered as a less practical means, since it is not an easy task to maintain the ring topology of the product while eliminating the initiator residues.26', 'A number of new processes have recently been developed to address this problem in the ring-expansion polymerization (Scheme 2). Thus, a new Ru catalyst bearing a cyclic ligand containing the Ru-alkylidene unit has been introduced and applied for the ring-expansion polymerization of cyclic olefins such as 1,5-cyclooctadiene or cyclooctene.27 During the chain-growth process, the chain transfer to the Ru-alkylidene unit took place to eliminate the initiator complex, and consequently a ring polybutadiene or a ring poly(cyclooctene) free of the catalyst fragment, respectively, is produced. The obtained ring poly(cyclooctene)wasthenhydrogenatedtogivearing polyethylene, showing distinctive properties in comparison with commercial linear polyethylenes (Scheme 2A).27,28 It is notable, at the same time, that the random nature of this chain transfer process inherently causes the broadening of the molecular weight distribution of the product. This process has now been applied with a bulky, dendronized monomer to construct a ring nano-object directly observable by atomic force microscopy (AFM).29', 'More recently, a new N-heterocyclic carbene initiator was introduced for the ring-expansion polymerization of lactones or lactide to form ring polyesters or polylactide, respectively (Scheme 2B).30,31 Remarkably, the obtained ring polymers possess narrow molecular weight distributions through the elimination of the initiator fragment after the quantitative consumption of the monomer, in contrast to the metathesis ring-expansion process shown before.28 By exploiting the living character, this technique has subsequently been applied for the synthesis of ring block polypeptoids and of complex topological polymers having a ring with many branches, i.e., jellyfish poly-mers.32,33 A further development of the ring-expansion process would provide a wider variety of chemical structures in ring polymers by broadening the choice of monomer types.', 'The combination of the classical ring-expansion polymeriza-tion process, in which the initiator fragment is included within the ring polymer structure, with the end-to-end polymer cycli-zation process could provide a new effective means for ring polymers having, in particular, large sizes (Scheme 2C).34 Thus, a ring poly(caprolactone) having short photocrosslinkable block segments was prepared through a sequential living ring-expan-sion polymerization using a cyclic stannate initiator. The subsequent irradiation under dilution caused the intramolecular covalent linking of the two short segments. The subsequent removal of the stannate group produced a chemically stable ring polymer product, though the exact chemical structure of the linking units is obscure.34', '@', '@', 'By employing this methodology, a high-molecular weight ring poly(chloroethyl vinyl ether) was prepared and was subjected to the grafting-onto reaction using a living polystyrene, to form a densely grafted large ring polymer product as a nanoobject, which was directly observable by the AFM.35,36 On the other hand, the AFM showed a large fraction of uncyclized, linear polymer components remained in the crude cyclization products, revealing the inherent difficulty of the end-to-end cyclization of polymer precursors of high molecular weights. It is remarkable, moreover, that a small portion of nanoobjects corresponding to complex ring polymers having tadpole, 8-shaped, catenated and knotted forms were also identified. This showed, for the first time, that not only single-cyclic but also various complex cyclic polymer topologies are indeed produced through the polymer cyclization process, as previously shown in DNA systems.37', 'An electrostatic self-assembly and covalent fixation (ESA-CF) process has been introduced for the effective synthesis of not only cyclic but also functionalized cyclic and multicyclic polymers, where linear or star telechelic polymers having cyclic ammonium salt groups accompanying small or polymeric plurifunctional carboxylate counteranions are employed as key precursors (Scheme 1E).38–40 Various telechelic polymers have been conve-niently prepared through the relevant living polymerization fol-lowed by the end-capping/end-conversion technique. The choice of such particular types of cyclic ammonium salt end groups as five- and six-membered cyclic ammonium, i.e., N-phenyl-pyrrolidinium and N-phenylpiperidinium salt groups, respec-tively, is of a crucial importance in the ESA-CF process (Scheme 3).41 The former undergoes upon heating a selective ring-opening reaction by a carboxylate counteranion to form an amino ester group through the nucleophilic attack exclusively at the N-adjacent ring (endo) position. On the other hand, the latter having unstrained six-membered cyclic ammonium salt groups gives a chemically more stable, simple ester group through the nucleophilic attack at the alternative N-adjacent (exo) position, to eliminate N-phenylpiperidine.', 'And in the electrostatic polymer self-assembly, the cations at the end of the telechelics and the anions in the carboxylates counteranions always balance the charges. Upon the dilution, the self-assembly tends to dissociate into one having the smallest number of polymer components by keeping the balance of the charges (Scheme 4). Thus, when a self-assembly comprised of a linear telechelic precursor, typically poly(THF), having cyclic ammonium salt groups accompanying either a dicarboxylate or a tetracarboxylate counteranion was heated at dilution, the selective ring-opening reaction of the cyclic ammonium groups took place to produce single-cyclic (ring) or dicyclic (8-shaped) polymerproducts,respectively,inhighyields.38,42Ring poly(THF)s having the molecular weights of up to 10 000, cor-responding to the ring size of as high as 700 atoms, were obtainable and characterized unequivocally by the MALDI-TOF mass technique. Furthermore, the ESA-CF process with dynamic equilibrium nature has been exploited to construct various multicyclic as well as cyclic-linear hybrid polymer topologies (Scheme 5).6', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Moreover, ring polymers possessing the prescribed functional groups at the designated positions, i.e., kyklo-telechelics and cyclic macromonomer, have also been prepared by employing telechelic precursors possessing such functional groups as hydroxyl, olefinic, acetylenic, and azide groups at the designated, typically a center, position by using the relevant initiator, or by introducing functional linking reagents.43 They were subse-quently applied to construct more complex polymer topologies either through the covalent linkage or even through the non-covalent, mechanical linkage uniquely formed by threading with ring polymer units.44,45 It was also shown that network polymers formed from cyclic polymer precursors exhibited unique gel properties compared with conventional gels obtained with linear/ branched polymer precursors.46 Moreover, the topological conversion of polymers between ring/linear and even between single-cyclic/dicyclic topologies has now been achieved.45,47,48', 'By the combination of the ESA-CF protocol with selective covalent linking chemistry, a wide variety of multi-cyclic as well as cyclic-linear conjugated polymers have been synthesized.49 In particular, the combination of the ESA-CF process with the metathesis condensation and with the click process has now been revealed as a versatile means to construct a variety of complex multicyclic polymer topologies of fused-, spiro- and bridged forms (Scheme 6).50 Both the functional ring polymer precursors and thecovalentlylinkedmulticyclicpolymerproductwere unequivocally characterized by means of a series of spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques including MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy and SEC. As shown in Fig. 1, for a typical example, the structure of the polymer products having complex multicyclic topologies is convincingly demonstrated. The ESA-CF process has further been applied for the effective synthesis of topologi-cally unique polymer catenanes comprised of large polymer rings51 through the two orthogonal non-covalent interactions, namely the electrostatic and the hydrogen-bond interactions (Scheme 5).45', '@', '@', '3.Topology effects by cyclic polymers: depleting the chain-ends and beyond', 'In contrast to linear or branched polymer topologies, ring polymer topologies are uniquely defined by their absence of the chain ends.3,5 As recognized by the typical case of glass transition temperature (Tg), the topology effect of ring polymers is thus arisen from the depletion of the end-groups of polymer segments. Thus, the Tg of ring polymers is higher than the linear counter-part, until the polymer chain length becomes long enough to diminish the contribution of the chain end. On the contrary, the hydrodynamic volume or the melt viscosity of ring polymers is inherently smaller than their linear counterparts irrespective of their chain lengths. This indicates the distinctive conception in the topology effect by ring polymers. The latter is regarded as an inherent topology effect by ring polymers, while the former as the depletion effect of the polymer chain ends. Nevertheless, the elimination of the chain ends of polymer molecules inevitably leads to the formation of cyclic constructions to bring the topology effect, now drawing increasing interests to discover unusual properties and functions in polymer materials covering mechanical, thermal, electric, photonic and bio-related applica-tions either in bulk or at surface. From an experimental point of view, moreover, further developments are awaited to provide ring polymers possessing high molecular weights with guaran-teed purity, since the mixing of even small amount of linear counterpartmightcauseinconclusiveorevenerroneous conclusions on the topology effect by ring polymers.', '4.Topology effects on basic polymer properties: simulations and experiments from simple to complex cyclic polymers', 'Basic characteristics of single-cyclic (ring) homopolymers either in solution or bulk, in static or dynamic states, have extensively been studied and documented relevantly.3 Therefore, recent studies have elaborated either on specific polymers of practical importance like polyethylenes,52 on specific chain characteristics like semiflexible to stiff nature,53 or on multicomponent polymer systemstypicallyblockcopolymers.54Notably,moreover, theory and simulation studies have increasingly focused on multi-cyclic complex polymers, obviously promoted by synthetic developments on complex topological polymers.55–57 Unique topological polymer properties envisaged by the simulation studies are now to be verified experimentally using relevant topological polymers. Indeed, a collaborative simulation and experimental study on the liquid chromatography study has been conducted on multi-cyclic polymers, and could provide a basis for the purification and the characterization of polymers having complex topologies.58', '@', '@', 'The diffusion behavior is of particular interest in view of the topology effects on polymer molecules, since the self-diffusion of linear and branched polymers follows the reptation mechanism, a snake-like translational motion, in which the polymer chain ends tend to command the motion of their in-chain segments.59Cyclic polymers are unique, on the other hand, in the absence of chain ends, and their non-reptation dynamics has been a subject of both theory/simulation and experimental studies.60', 'A single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy is a unique means to observe directlythe motion of single polymer molecules.61 Thus, the ESA-CF process was applied with mono- and bifunctional telechelic poly(THF) precursors having N-phenylpiperidinium (six-membered ring) groups possessing a perylene dicarboxylate counteranion, to produce ring and linear poly(THF)s having a perylene unit applicable to the single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy measurement (Scheme 7).62', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The subsequent single-molecule imaging was conducted to observe the real-time motion of individual polymer molecules. The video-recording of the motion of single-molecule fluores-cence images, followed by the computational analysis could provide the position and trajectory of the object on the x–y plane as shown in Fig. 2. The histograms of the distribution of the individual diffusion constant were subsequently obtained from large enough datasets of these consecutive images. Upon the statistical analysis of the distribution patterns, a bimodal diffu-sion mechanism was disclosed for ring polymers, corresponding to either threaded or non-threaded conditions in a linear mole-cule matrix. In contrast, the unimodal diffusion was indicated for the linear counterpart (Fig. 3).', 'As shown above, the significant topology effects could be envisaged in polymer properties involving their diffusion process. In this respect, the crystallization dynamics is of a considerable interest since the diffusion and the conformational trans-formation of polymer molecules could dictate the folding and packing of polymer segments in the crystal lattice. To elucidate the topology effect in the crystallization process, a defect-free ring poly(THF) was prepared together with the linear counterpart having the precisely relevant chemical structure.63 Thus, a living bifunctional poly(THF) was terminated with sodium allyloxide to give a telechelic precursor having allyl end groups. The subsequent metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC) with a Grubbs catalyst under dilution, followed by the hydrogenation of the unsaturated linking group afforded a defect-free ring poly(THF), consisting exclusively of oxytetramethylene units (Scheme 8). The isothermal crystallization experiments showed the slower crystallization rate for ring poly(THF)s ascribed to their topologically constrained conformation (Fig. 4). Moreover,', '@', '@', '@', '@ distinctive crystal morphologies are produced, in particular a banded structure in the spherulites exclusively for the ring poly (THF) but not for the linear counterpart. The crystallization kinetics of ring poly(3-caprolactone)s has recently been reported by several groups.64 The faster crystallization rate was observed for ring polymers than the linear counterpart in contrast to the case of poly(THF), and was ascribed to the higher diffusion of ring polymers than their linear counterparts.64', '@', '@', '@', '@', '5.Topology effects by ring polymers in self-assemblies', 'The topology effects by ring polymers could be amplified in their assembled states rather than in their individually separated forms. Therefore, micelles formed by ring polymers should be of a remarkable interest. Thus, a series of micelles were prepared with amphiphilic cyclic AB block copolymers, comprised of eitherpoly(butyleneoxide)/poly(ethyleneoxide)orpoly (propylene oxide)/poly(ethylene oxide), together with their linear AB, linear ABA block copolymer counterparts.65–67 The cyclic block copolymer employed in this study was prepared by a bimolecular process using the hydroxy-terminated linear block copolymer and dichloromethane as a linking reagent in the presence of KOH, to form an acetal linking unit (Scheme 9A).', 'The critical micelle concentration (cmc) of the micelle with the cyclic AB block copolymer was similar to or marginally smaller than those with the linear ABA counterparts. On the contrary, the corresponding micelle with the linear AB counterpart showed a significantly smaller cmc. Moreover, the association number (Nw), thermodynamic radius (rt), and hydrodynamic radius (rh) of the micelle with the cyclic AB block copolymers and with the linear ABA counterparts were comparable to each other, but distinctively smaller than those with the linear AB counterparts. These results are consistent with the geometric estimation of the size of the micelles, corresponding to the Nw, rt, and rh, which is dependent on the continuous chain length of the hydrophobic segment in the block copolymers. And, those in the cyclic AB and the linear ABA block copolymers are estimated as a half of that in the linear AB counterpart employed in this study. Moreover, the cyclic AB block copolymer tends to constitute a stiff hairpin-like conformation, resulting in a slightly larger hydrophobic core within the micelle compared to that with the linear ABA coun-terpart having free chain ends. The enthalpy of micellization (DmicH�) was also smaller with the cyclic AB block copolymer than that with the corresponding linear ABA counterpart, presumably because the segmental flip-flop is inhibited in the micelle with the former, in contrast to the motional freedom by the latter having free chain ends. This also agrees with the smaller entropy of micellization (DmicS�) with the cyclic AB block copolymer than with the linear counterpart.', '@', '@', 'More recently, a significant topology effect has been revealed in the thermal stability of the micelle formed with cyclic AB block copolymers in comparison with the linear ABA and even with the linear AB counterparts.68 Notably, a variety of relevant cyclic lipids, thus a type of surfactants, have been discovered in the cell membrane of thermophilic archaea, single-cell microorganisms, surviving in the hostile environment of very high-temperatures located at hot springs and submarine volcanoes.69 Thus, an amphiphilic cyclic AB block copolymer, comprised of poly(butyl acrylate)/poly(ethylene oxide) segments, was prepared. The unimolecular, metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC) process was employed using a linear ABA block copolymer precursor having olefinic end groups (Scheme 9B).21', 'The obtained cyclic and the relevant linear block copolymers were allowed to form the corresponding micelles, in which their cmc’s and the number-average hydrodynamic volumes (Dh) were measured to be closely comparable to each other (Fig. 5).68 The size and morphology of the micelles with either block copolymers were directly observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 6) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 6) to show commonly flower-like spherical shapes possessing the consistent diameters determined by DLS (Scheme 10).', 'Remarkably, the thermal stability of the micelles was drasti-cally enhanced using the cyclic block copolymer. Thus, the corresponding micelle solutions were heated from 20�C in a stepwise fashion (Fig. 7), and the micelle with the linear ABA block copolymer became turbid at around 25 �C, while that with the cyclic AB counterpart was stable till above 70 �C.68', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Based on the large deviation of the clouding point (Tc) among the micelles either solely with cyclic or with linear block copol-ymers, the tuning of the Tc of the micelle was achieved by the coassembly of both the linear and cyclic block copolymers.68Thus, the Tc was systematically altered along with the relative contents of the cyclic and the linear block copolymer compo-nents in the micelle, as shown in Fig. 7.68 This topology effect will be utilized to design temperature-responsive devices encapsu-lating and releasing appropriate components in and from the micelle. In particular, the topology-based polymer materials design should be suitable for human body-related applications including drug delivery system, food, and cosmetics, for which the modification of chemical structure and molecular weight mightinducereasonableconcernoverthetoxicityand biocompatibility.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '6.Topology effects by functional ring polymers having programmed chemical structures', 'Along with the introduction of new synthetic methodologies, an increasing variety of functional ring polymers and oligomers have become obtainable to exploit their topology effects. A number of recent studies are presented in this section, covering a diverse field either by conjugated cyclic oligomers,70 by photo-responsive ring polymers,71,72 by biodegradable ring polyesters,14by temperature-responsive ring polymers,12,13or by pharmaco-logically functional ring polymers.73', 'Conjugated polymers and oligomers have currently been extensively studied primarily due to their potential for diverse electronic and photonic applications.74 Ring-shaped conjugated polymers and oligomers have attracted particular interests as a prototype of the molecularly fabricated electric circuit, since the circulation of electrons/holes might be induced along the ‘‘endless’’ conjugated segments. A wide variety of conjugated ring oligomers possessing the increasing numbers of unsaturated groups have thus been prepared to test their electrochemical properties.70 Fully conjugated large ring polymers, on the other hand, have still been an elusive synthetic challenge. It is notable, moreover, that a twisted, Moebius stripe-like conjugated olig-omer has attracted considerable interests because of their unusual non-H€uckel aromaticity, in contrast to the conventional H€uckel-type aromaticity which is dependent on its planar geometry by conjugated units.75', 'Photo-response behaviors could be influenced by polymer topologies of either ring or linear forms. Thus, a ring polymer having photo-responsive azobenzene units in the main chain was prepared through the bimolecular end-to-end cyclization via click chemistry.71 Upon the irradiation of UV light, both the trans-to-cis and the cis-to-trans isomerization proceeded slightly faster by the ring polymer in comparison with the linear counterpart. This behavior was attributed to the higher topo-logical constraint of the former than the latter counterpart.71 As another example, a ring polystyrene having two photoactive groups, namely fluorene and anthracene units, was prepared through the bimolecular process using a living bifunctional polystyrene produced with an initiator having a fluorene unit and a linking reagent having an anthracene unit.72 The fluo-rescent behavior of the obtained ring polymer was subsequently studied to show the intramolecular energy migration between the two chromophores.72', 'Naturally occurring ring polymers, such as cyclic DNAs, cyclic peptides as well as cyclic polysaccharides,3 and multi-cyclic counterparts like cyclotides,76 are known to exhibit higher stability against biologically induced decomposition. In this relevance, the topology effect of aliphatic biodegradable poly-esters on their decomposition behavior has been investigated.14Thus, ring poly(caprolactone) was prepared through the unim-olecular click polymer cyclization using the corresponding precursor having an azide and an alkyne group. The higher hydrolytic stability was then observed in comparison with the linear counterparts.14 Notably, moreover, such biodegradable ring polyesters by poly(valerolactone) and by poly(lactide) were also prepared.15,30,31,77', 'Temperature-responsivepropertiesofpoly(N-iso-propylacrylamide), poly(NIPAM), have extensively been studied for their eventual uses in the controlled release devices and for the cell–sheet applications.78 The two groups recently reported the topology effects by ring poly(NIPAM)s.12,13 Thus, the two groups prepared linear poly(NIPAM) precursors having alkyne and azide end groups either by a reversible addition–fragmen-tation chain transfer (RAFT) or by an atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) technique, and the unimolecular click process was commonly applied for the subsequent polymer cyclization. The cloud point (TCP) of the obtained ring poly(NIPAM) by one group was several degrees higher than that of the corresponding linear counterpart. In addition, they observed that the phase transition by the ring polymers took place distinctively slower upon heating.12 Another group, on the other hand, observed the ring poly(NIPAM) showing a few degrees lower TCP against the linear counterpart at the higher solution concentration, while higher at the lower solution concentration. Furthermore, they reported the smaller enthalpy change (DH) during the phase transition with the ring poly (NIPAM). These results were accounted for by the suppression of the hydrogen bond interaction between the ring poly(NIPAM) with water molecules due to their topological constraints in comparison with the flexible linear counterpart having free chain ends.13', 'A pharmacological application of ring polymers has recently been demonstrated by elucidating the filtration/elimination mechanism of a kidney through its nanoporous channel.73 Thus, it was anticipated that the ring polymer could remain longer in a body than the linear counterpart, since the former should be reluctant to transform its conformation into a folded shape to traverse through the nanoporous channels of the kidney.73 To test this topology effect, a series of linear and cyclic poly(capro-lactone)s having poly(ethylene glycol) graft segments and having phenolic functionalities for radiolabeling by 125I were prepared. The lower secretion into urine and in turn the higher accumu-lation in various organs was indeed confirmed with the ring polymer having an appropriate molecular weight, corresponding to its hydrodynamic volume.73 These findings may provide new design methodologies for drug carriers and imaging agents via the topology-based control of a blood circulation time.', '7.Conclusions and future perspectives', 'In this review, we have shown a variety of recent achievements in topological polymer chemistry, to focus on novel polymer properties and functions uniquely revealed by ring polymers. The topology effects, in particular by ring polymers have now offered unique opportunities in polymer materials design unattainable by other means. A viable promise for the practical utilization of the topology effect undoubtedly includes the modification of any existing polymeric materials dependent mostly on linear poly-mers, inflicting little concern on chemical toxicity and environ-mentalpollution.Furthermore,broaderopportunitiesof topology effects by not only single-cyclic but also multi-cyclic polymers are expected in polymer chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, and materials science.', 'Acknowledgements', 'We thank Sekisui Chemical Grant Program for Research on Manufacturing Based on Learning from Nature (Y.T.), The Mitsubishi Foundation (Y.T.), Tokuyama Science Foundation (T.Y.), CASIO Science Promotion Foundation (T.Y.), The Japan Securities Scholarship Foundation (T.Y.), The Kurata Memorial Hitachi Science and Technology Foundation (T.Y.), and Yazaki Memorial Foundation for Science and Technology for financial support.

As conventional plastics degrade in the environment, their decomposition has been known to produce microplastics.4 These materials have already affected global soils, which cycle further into the water, air, and atmosphere, and into our food chain.4 Conventional plastics such as low density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polystyrene (PS), are non-biodegradable and have been shown to remain in the environment in various forms for over 450 years.5,6', 'In addition, single-use petrochemical plastic use has con-tinued to increase, particularly in recent years during the COVID-19 pandemic by reliance on plastic disposable items for safety and hygienic purposes.7 In addition, it has been reported that over 20 million metric tons of plastic waste, or 11% of the total plastic waste generated, directly entered aquatic ecosystems around the globe in 2016, with that numberpredictedtonearlydoubleby2030.6Nearly 400 million metric tons of plastic are annually produced worldwide as of 2023 from raw petrochemical feedstocks.2,8The management of this waste generated from raw feedstock has led to compounded economic, environmental, and health safety challenges.8–10 For instance, only a small fraction of the total amount of virgin plastic, ranging from 5–30%, is available for re-purposing or recycled for further use. This in turn gener-ates a loss of up to 95% of the original economic value for the material.5,9,11–14', 'This has led to much economic opportunities lost for a potential circular “bio-plastic” economy. Even with increasing global efforts to manage plastic waste pollution, ongoing studies of the complex social, economic, and scientific issues of plastic waste management indicate that predicted growth in plastic waste generation exceeds current efforts for mitigating overall plastic pollution.6,15 These results indicate that urgent transformative changes in both materials design and policies are needed to help address this crisis.2,8,14,16', 'These ongoing concerns have generated strong interest in biologically sourced and biodegradable polymers as alterna-tives to conventional plastics. One model for potential future materials use includes the ultimate goal of creating a more cir-cular, sustainable plastic economy in which the idea of waste is re-imagined.4 In this model of bio-based plastic substitutes, the waste products of end-of-life biopolymers can ultimately be re-used as raw feedstocks, as opposed to a more linear model, such as with conventional plastic, in which the material is simply unusable with current recycling infrastructure and technology or otherwise discarded.17–21', 'Polyhydroxyalkanotes (PHAs) are one example of a family of biologically produced polyesters that have been extensively investigated for their benefits as plastic alternatives.22–26 These well-known biopolymer materials, first developed in the early 20th century, are synthesized and accumulate in microbes in the presence of excess carbon sources and nutrients, acting as an energy storage mechanism.27,28 PHAs have often been selected and utilized as a model biologically-sourced polyester for their attractive and versatile qualities. Some of these qual-ities include robust biocompatibility, non-toxic degradation products, and chemical tunability. In addition, PHAs also have a unique opportunity to be recycled or reused by both chemi-cal and biological means at the end of their life cycle for further use.1,23,26,29,30', 'In addition, PHAs have been known to degrade effectively in aquatic and soil-based environments during both enzymatic and hydrolytic degradation.10,30 One recent study by Omura and colleagues examined a series of commercially available biodegradable and non-biodegradable plastic materials at different ocean depths, in both coastal and deep-sea floor environments, and PHA materials and copolymers were shown todecomposeeffectivelywithspecificmicroorganisms.10These findings have generated interest in developing PHA materials with potential to be decomposed as soon as they are discharged into the ocean, with many new and exciting oppor-tunities for PHA development.10', '@', '@', 'Dr Babetta (Babs) L.

For instance, compared to the price of producing virgin plastic material in USD for PP ($0.45–0.68 per lb),35 PS ($0.54–0.82 per lb),35 PLA ($1.00–1.37 per lb),36 or other starch-based bio-degradable polymers ($0.91–2.04 per lb),35–37 PHB on average costs between $1.81–3.20 per lb based on data collected between 2020–2023.38,39 Unfortunately, there have also been challenges for commercial production including overall setup, production, and capital costs, slow rate of market adoption, and limited projected financial returns leading to additional economic challenges for PHA biopolymer production.', 'Moreover, while the diversity of verified types of PHAs is extensive, the amount of commercially produced PHAs is rather limited, with available polymers and copolymers largely constrained to a narrow set of chemistries that are dominated by polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), otherwise known as poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (or P3HB). PHB the most commonly commer-cially available PHA.27,31 Other commonly available copolymers of PHB include poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (typically written as PHBV or P3HB3HV) and poly(3-hydroxybu-tyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHHx).27,40,41', 'The limited chemical diversity and tunability exhibited by commercially available PHAs also result in materials selection and design challenges.42 Specifically, the narrow and often unsuitable range of thermal processing windows and mechani-cal properties, and limited degradation rates which are some-times comparable to other less expensive biopolymers such as polylactic acid (PLA) pose great hurdles for PHAs towards their use in a range of applications.29,43 Currently, this renders PHAs either unsuitable or too expensive to be realistic alterna-tives to traditional plastics.20,44–46', 'However, despite their expense, PHAs still offer many unique advantages in terms of biodegradability, compostabil-ity and non-toxicity, and potential for long-term sustainability in commercial use when compared to more widespread plastic alternatives available today.47,48 While these hurdles pose sig-nificant and interdependent challenges to widespread PHA use, they also present unique opportunities from both research and economic perspectives to understand and improve the overall PHA materials design paradigm for this class of materialsaswellasothercommerciallylimited biopolymers.16,19,23', 'When addressing materials design challenges such as those currently faced by PHAs, one central materials science frame-work relates the properties, structure, processing, and perform-ance (PSPP) of a material in interconnected pair-wise relation-ships epitomized by the classic materials tetrahedron, as shown in Fig. 1. The concept of PSPP relationships has been extensively applied to many areas of materials science ranging from alloy design to perovskites and heterogeneous catalysis to pharmaceuticals, but remains relatively less explored in the context of bio-derived polymer design, in general, and for PHA-based biopolymer design, specifically.49,50', 'The materials tetrahedron has also been recently re-ima-gined in a contemporary, information science-focused perspec- tive. This new perspective on a classic paradigm also aims to reduce the overall time and cost to discover and develop new materials by re-establishing the tetrahedron as a framework for novel design principles.51 It is well established that the PSPP relationships are particularly suitable for developing and examining quantifiable relationships between an available material’s structure and its potential properties, as well as in connecting its processing history to the target performance.51Therefore, there is potential to both explore and improve the scientific understanding of these relationships as well as enhance the commercial PHA design space by using a well-known PSPP framework and establishing it in an inno-vative way towards biopolymer identification, design, and development.', 'In traditional implementations of the materials science tetrahedron, the structure, property, processing, and perform-ance parameters have been essential. Each of the branches of the tetrahedron provide a framework to not only understand their interconnected nature, but also has been historically used in the rational design and optimization of novel and existing materials in other areas of materials science.51,52 In this review, we have surveyed these PSPP relationships in the context of PHA biopolymers by examining current state-of-the-art examples of ongoing research.', 'Here, we apply this PSPP relationship framework to under-stand and highlight the scope of the underlying chemical space, outstanding design challenges, conflicting trends in properties, as well as current limitations and potential for future improvements in the broad research area of PHA biopo-lymers that have the potential to utilize modern experimental approaches. Our work also establishes a precedent for other types of biopolymers to be examined in a similar, materials-centric, design-focused way.', '2Control of PHA structure', '2.1Chemical and morphological structure of PHAs', 'At the most fundamental level, the chemical structure of a polymer is dictated by the atomic constituents forming the monomers and their connections. Monomers of one or more types can then combine in a backbone and side chain in different compositions to form either homopolymers (made up entirely of one monomer type) or copolymers (made up of several different monomers). For a given composition, the rela-tive placement of different monomers along the polymer back-bone can further give rise to different copolymer microstruc-tures (for instance, random, block or alternate) resulting in qualitatively different interchain interactions. These inter-actions in turn dictate how closely the polymer chains are packed together, giving rise to the overall mesoscopic morpho-logical structure.53', 'Therefore, the overall structure in polymers, including PHAs, which are in general linear, aliphatic polyesters, is largely governed by: (1) the intrinsic chemical nature of the building blocks at the atomic-scale, (2) non-bonding inter- chain interactions at the microscopic level, and (3) the relative ratio and distribution of crystalline and amorphous regions at the mesoscopic level to form the overall morphology of the polymer.53–55 These notions are graphically illustrated in Fig. 2. The wide range of dispersity indices and variations in molecular weight across PHAs produced biologically have also been shown to generate higher uncertainties in the resulting thermal and mechanical properties, which presents future opportunitiesfordevelopinganunderstandingofthese relationships in a more quantitative way.56,57', '@', '@', '@', 'There is a significant amount of structural diversity that is currently available for PHAs at the monomer level, leading to a wide range of variety in possible interactions at both the microscopic level and in the overall morphological structure of the polymer.27,57,58 There are currently at least 150 structurally unique PHA monomers that have been verifiably identified and biosynthesized since 1995, leading to many possible com-binationsofpotentialpolymersandcopolymersof PHAs.56,58–60 However, in addition to these monomers, poten-tially there exist a number of other chemistries that might be accessible in the near-future either biologically or via chemical polymerization, or via grafting.61 Because the materials pro-perties of the PHAs depend on the multi-scale structural aspects described above, this opens a tremendous opportunity in terms of tuning PHA structure to meet specific property portfolio requirements.60', 'Much of the diversity in the actual physical PHA chemical structure is derived from three main sources in varying the components of the polymer: (1) variety in the number of carbon atoms in the polymer backbone, (2) the number of carbons in the side chain branching from a backbone carbon atom, and (3) the presence/absence as well as chemical nature of any side-chain functional groups in the structure.27,62 In regard to the latter two diversity factors, the side chain of a PHA typically ranges from 1–16 carbons in length, and there is also a variety of functional groups, such as phenyl groups, with varying numbers of carbons in the side chain.62–64', 'The features that can be modified to produce the unique PHA monomers are the previously listed three components, that can be seen as examples in Fig. 2. The left panel of Fig. 2 indicates modifications that can be made of the standard hydroxybutyrate (HB) monomer. For instance, the addition of another carbon in the main backbone chain of the structure will change the PHA monomer from 3HB to 4HB, while the addition of another carbon in the side chain of the structure will change the PHA monomer from 3HB to 3HV. Thus, the number of carbons in both the backbone and side chain of the structure itself will affect the type of PHA monomer that is pro-duced. Additionally, changing the functional group in the side chain of the structure will also affect the monomer: for instance, the inclusion of a phenyl group in the side chain of the structure will change the PHA monomer from 3HV to 3H4PhB. These changes in the monomer will also affect the typeofpolymerandcopolymerblocksthatmaybe synthesized.', '@', '@', 'There is a separate, alternative classification terminology system that is frequently employed to address different types of PHAs on the basis of the number of carbon atoms in the backbone and side chain itself. These classifications include a PHA with backbone and side chains of less than 5 carbons, short-chain length (scl), and those with the number of back-bone and side chains between 6–14, medium-chain length (mcl),or evenlonger carbonchains,long-chainlength (lcl).40,64–66 In addition, it is known that due to their method of biological synthesis and fermentation, PHAs formed by natural means are strictly isotactic and feature only (R)-con- figurations in their chiral stereocenter in the main carbon backbone of the polyester chain, but some variations have been synthesised by synthetic means.27', 'Each of these structural components have been demon-strated to have unique effects on the PHA polymer properties, affectingeverythingfromitscrystallinitytoits thermo-mechanical properties and degradation rate. An example of this behavior can be observed in the case of polyhydroxyvale-rate. This polymer is also written and abbreviated as poly(3-hydroxyvalerate), PHV, and P3HV. It may be referred to as HV in its monomer unit form. PHV is often also used as a copoly-mer with PHB. Although PHV contains just one additional carbon in the side chain compared to PHB, PHV has a lower melting and glass transition temperature and is far more elastic, in addition to varying the molecular weight of the copolymer versus the homopolymer.67 For instance, it has been shown that in general, a greater number of carbons in the side chain of the PHA leads to: a decrease in melting and glass transition temperatures, a decrease in elastic modulus, and an increase in yield at elongation, as well as potentially lower molecular weight depending on the method of synthesis, crys-tallinity, and polymer type.68–70', 'A greater number of carbons in the PHA backbone and side chain have been particularly associated with an increase in the overall degradation rate.71 This has largely been attributed to the increased number of carbons creating additional steric hindrance that the additional groups bring to the semi-crystal-line packing structure of the PHA. A decrease in PHA crystalli-nity in polymers with a higher number of carbons in either the backbone or side chain and PHA copolymers has also been reported.72 Because these amorphous regions have enhanced susceptibility to hydrolytic degradation, this phenomenon of enhanced degradation is believed to be largely due to this decreaseincrystallinitywithinthesesemi-crystalline polymers.73,74 These effects will be discussed in further detail in section 3 of this review.', 'In addition to PHA homopolymers and block or random copolymers combining multiple types of PHAs, there have been previous studies that have altered the structure of existing PHA polymers by incorporating other types of polymers in blends.65,75–78 Further modification of the polymer structure using additives, which in turn affects the properties of the resulting material, has also been extensively explored in prior investigations.79–82 These additions to PHA polymers are con-sidered here as additional modifications to the base PHA structure, rather than a unique element of the structure of the PHA polymer itself. These modifications will be discussed in further detail in section 3 in this review. However, we note that the interconnected nature of the polymer chain structure has been shown to influence the material in all aspects of the materials tetrahedron, ranging from properties to the possible processing routes for the PHA.83 Additional details regarding the synthesis of PHAs as described in the following section, by both biological and chemical means, are critical to also con-sider when developing a more holistic PSPP relationship for these materials.', '2.2Factors affecting structure of PHAs in biosynthetic and chemical routes', 'There are many important factors affecting the structure of PHAs, ranging from the synthesis route to the processing method. PHAs are synthesized by a wide range of microorgan-isms as part of their natural metabolic processes as internal energy reserves in the presence of both: (1) excess levels of carbon and other energy sources (feedstocks such as wheat or flour, sugars (e.g., glycerol), food waste, dairy processing waste, or cooking oil, carbon dioxide gas, other forms of starch, etc.) and (2) stressful environmental conditions, such as critical nutrient limitations (e.g., nitrogen).84–90', 'PHAs are most widely produced by biological, natural syn-thesis processes within a living cell. Under normal conditions and a non-stressful environment, many PHA-producing micro-organisms will utilize nutrients such as nitrogen, phospho-rous, oxygen and carbon-rich organic matter in the tricar-boxylic acid (TCA) or citric acid cycle to consume energy.57,91The TCA cycle is a well-studied series of chemical reactions that occur within cellular organisms to release stored energy by oxidation of acetyl-CoA derived from energy sources such as fats and carbohydrates.92 Recently, extensive studies have been conducted specifically on the metabolic pathways for the bio-synthesis of various natural and non-natural PHAs that explore these relationships from a mechanistic perspective.28,57,61 These reviews provide explicit detail on how PHA biosynthesis is conducted from the metabolism from the carbon source to the polymerization of monomeric components into specific PHAs and should be consulted for specific metabolic pathway and synthesis enzyme details.28,57', 'Both the available biochemical pathways and diversity of PHA-producing organisms have been well-documented in the literature.93–97 Under stressful conditions, such as excess carbon, or limited oxygen or nutrients, microorganisms and bacteria will metabolize the excess organic matter and use the acetyl-CoA normally used in the TCA cycle to instead syn-thesize PHA polymers as energy reserves using either existing orgenetically-encodedbiochemicalpathways.86,91,92Some examples of these biochemical reactions include hydrolysis, transesterification, and glycolysis, which are each also used to convert PHA precursors such as fatty acids, sugars, and amino acids into PHA monomers. These monomers are subsequently converted to intracellular granules of PHA polymers, which are stored in the microorganism.98,99 Depending on the available biochemical pathways and the substrate, both wild-type and genetically modified microorganisms have been shown to be able to synthesize a variety of PHAs.45,97', 'In general, PHA commercial production involves the culture of microorganisms for replication, followed by mixing in a cul-tivation tank or bioreactor with a substrate such as glycerol, starch, or other carbon sources using products such as carbon dioxide gas, food waste, dairy processing waste, and used cooking oil.86,90,100Under specific, nutrient-limiting con-ditions, the microorganisms will then produce PHA polymers internally, consuming the substrate to varying degrees of gene-ration of polymer mass.80 For instance, wild-type C. necator has been observed to generate up to 80% of its original dry weight in PHA polymer.57,89', 'The raw PHA polymer is released from the biomass via cell lysis following completion of biosynthesis, followed by solvent extraction.101,102 Lysis is often performed to break open the organism and perform the extraction using a centrifuge and a series of filtration steps. The PHA can then be purified and dried into a useable form, such as a powder or granule form for additional processing. These methods have been well-docu-mentedbyavarietyofbothhistoricalandcurrent studies.101,103 The leftover residual non-PHA biomass can also potentially be used for other uses such as fertilizer.89 The extent to which commercial production methods of PHAs themselves directly and indirectly affect the resulting chemical structure is still an open area of research.57,97 Prior investi-gation has revealed that many possible PHA homopolymer and copolymer structures can be obtained by utilizing variations in the microorganisms themselves, indicating that one of the main contributing factors to producing different types of PHAs are the available metabolic pathways that are present within each unique organism.104–108', 'Recently, an extensive review was assembled on the diversity of microbial production of bio-derived monomers and the environmental circularity in their production, including indi-vidual strain, carbon sources, and yield. This also mirrors the diversity of PHA production by microorganisms and bacterial strains.109 There are a wide variety of PHA producers, which belongtomanydifferenttypesofphylarangingfrom MycobacteriumandStreptomycestoNeisseriaand Pseudomonas, with many studies articulating the necessary genetic and metabolic pathways for the different types of organisms to produce different types of PHAs.57,102,110,111', 'Currently,C.necator,P.oleovorans,Pseudomonassp., Synechococcus sp. and Halomonas sp. are among the most com-monly studied producers of PHB, with both wild-type and genetically modified organisms investigated extensively in pre-vious studies.57,83,91,110,112–114 There is an emphasis in the lit-erature to determine the optimal organism type, growth and carbon source conditions, and overall genetic pathways with scalable factors to produce the highest yield of cell dry mass as possible.111,115,116 For instance, one recent study explored the production of a copolymer of 3-hdyroxydecanoate and 3-hydro-xydodecanoate using Pseudomonas aeruginosa MC5300 with yields up to 75.6% of original dry weight of the cell with up to 16 hours of growth.111', 'The carbon source and nutrient limiting conditions that fuel biosynthesis pathways within PHA-producing microorganisms are also required contributors to the synthesis and polymeriz-ation processes performed by the organism, and greatly influ-ence the extent to which the structure and chemistry of the PHA may be manipulated.102,112,117 Without a carbon source, the organism would have no way to utilize their unique enzymes and biochemical synthesis pathways to produce a PHA polymer.34,62,118 Here, we distinguish between carbon sources supplied to the organism as a substrate, and nutrients. Nutrients, in contrast to carbon sources, are other molecules in the cultivation or fermentation broth supplied to the organ-ism to help it to grow, and may include vitamins, co-factors, nitrogen,phosphorous,orothers–dependingonthe organism.28,57,61,102', 'Therefore, although how each organism utilizes these sub-strates is a unique process according to their own biochemis-try, the carbon source and nutrient types themselves are just as vital, and may affect the resulting material.28,102,119 The effects that each of these factors have independently as well as in tandem with one another are not currently well understood although well-documented. This opportunity presents a poten-tial new research direction for a large-scale experiment quanti-fying the relationship of carbon source and nutrient type to the outcome of the PHA produced by the biosynthetic pathway.', 'A variety of carbon sources have been tested in laboratory-scale bioreactors ranging from pure carbon dioxide and methane gases to coffee, rice, vegetable compost, cooking oil, dairy processing waste, and glycerol wastes.90,102,120 Each com-bination of substrate and organism was shown to yield slightly differentfinalPHApolymerside-chainlengths.45,90,120Currently, Gahlawat has reported studies that demonstrate control over the number of carbons in both the backbone and side chain of the PHA and the ability to incorporate phenyl and other bulk side chain functional groups.102 Many studies have also achieved tremendous advances in genetic and meta- bolic engineering of the organisms to produce these specific chemical structures, and reducing the cost of required carbon sources and substrates.120–122', 'Previous studies have outlined the challenges with increas-ingtheoverallyieldandstructuraldiversityinPHA production.100,123,124 A recent review by Corti Monzon and col-leagues has also surveyed the use of petrochemical hydro-carbons as potential feedstocks for PHA biosynthesis.115Several of these studies have explored methane, octane, diesel, and also styrene from pyrolysis of PS, essentially utilizing feed-stocks derived from the products of burning virgin petrochem-ical plastic waste, although notable scaling challenges have been reported.', 'Additional ongoing challenges to biological production of PHAs that remain to be addressed include integrating the relationship between the nutrient limitation and substrate with the microorganism type.121,122 The most common and prominent PHAs that have been commercially developed as of nowinclude PHB, and copolymers such asPHBV and PHBHHx, as briefly discussed above.27,31,40 The functional groups that are most commonly accessed in current research include carbon side chains of varying lengths and phenyl groups.27,83,112 The ongoing challenge to produce optimal yields is continuously balanced with optimizing the recovery process with cost efficiency. Also equally important is the task of integrating PHA biosynthesis into existing production lines to increase PHA compatibility with existing polymer processing equipment.83,86,100,125', 'Combining more than one type of microorganism in an effort to produce higher yields of PHAs has been also exten-sively studied in a method known as mixed microbial consor-tia as an alternative to genetic engineering.126 This area of research focuses on engineering the environmental con-ditions, nutrient sources and substrates, and carbon sources, rather than tuning the genome of the microorganisms.126However, the type, quantity, and distribution of the PHA struc-ture produced by the consortium has been shown to depend on the nature of the substrate fed to the organisms during PHA synthesis, leading to the additional importance of the substrate to the overall biosynthesis path to creating a final PHA structure.83,86', 'Some recent studies have been able to utilize bacterial colo-nization directing techniques to improve the overall properties and performance in PHA materials. In a specific case, Campano and colleagues have explored the control of the bac-terial colonization process using bacterial cellulose to produce PHB.127 Following acid treatment to the PHB-cellulose bonded films, the elastic modulus increased and oxygen permeability decreased with respect to the control PET film over 4 and 3 fold times, respectively.127', 'In contrast to biological synthesis, there is also an active area of research investigating the chemical synthesis methods of PHA production. The chemical routes of PHA synthesis by artificial (i.e. non-biological means) is an evolving field, and many reports specifically examine the potential chemical pro-cedures by which to develop PHAs artificially or semi-artifi- cially. For instance, one ‘chemical’ or semi-artificial means of PHA production involves the recycling of fossil fuel-based feed-stock or other chemical waste products to provide the energy resources for bacterial to generate the PHB. In this way, these approaches are not necessarily ‘chemical’ in nature as they still involve the biological synthesis of PHAs, but they incorporate chemical feedstocks into the biological means of developing the polymer. This process of ‘up-cycling’ waste feedstocks has been well-explored.86,97,128,129 One approach by Parodi and colleagues has also incorporated waste PHB itself directly into the feedstock cycle to synthesis ‘new’ PHB material, working to complete the circular waste-to-use lifecycle using an Oxa-Michael reaction to generate PHB monomers.130 A recent study by Zhang and col-leagues has exemplified this ‘hybrid’ synthesis approach to combine both chemical and biological processes to produce PHAs.131 These approaches are typically less-utilized than conven-tional biological fermentation processes.27,58', 'Other approaches to developing PHAs by chemical means have explored alternate routes to modifying, by blending or grafting for instance, or chemically synthesizing the polymer. For instance, Olivera and colleagues have reported chemical modification of PHAs via halogenation, epoxidation, hydroxy-lation, carboxylation, chemical cross linking via sulphur vulca-nization, peroxidation, or radiation-induction, resulting in altered properties of the source biological material.132 In con-trast, chemical synthesis of aromatic PHAs and aromatic-ali-phatic PHAs has been achieved by Westlie and Chen via stereo-selectivering-openingpolymerizationofeight-membered cyclic diolides.133 This approach resulted in high molecular weight copolymerized PHAs, over 200 kg mol−1, which are mechanically resilient, hard, but ductile, up to 191% elonga-tion at break. In addition, these copolymers of PHB also achieved a thermal decomposition temperature of 281 °C, which is much higher than typically biologically produced PHAs.133', 'Another commonly-studied starting pathway for developing synthetic PHB by chemical means features alternating propy-lene oxide and carbon monoxide. This is typically a challen-ging retrosynthesis and copolymerization process. In addition, ring-opening polymerization of β-lactones is also used. Both of these processes require additional development for full indus-trial scaling.27 It is well-established that the conversion of different substances to PHA polymers by both small-batch and industrial biological means is a result of selectivity, genetic pathways, nutrient limitation, carbon sources, and biocatalysts and enzyme availability, all of which can lead to high disper-sity indices and high degrees of variation in the polymer mole-cular weight as well as batch to batch differences in the length of the polymer chains.27,58 These reports indicate chemical modification or production of PHAs can lead to customizable property value ranges and yield exciting new opportunities for further study.', 'The effects of stereochemistry of chemically synthesized PHB with regard to the crystallization behavior have been recently studied by Caputo and colleagues, in foundational work in the chemical synthesis of PHB.134 Detailed infor- mation regarding both the chemical synthesis and characteriz-ation of PHB polymers of different molecular weights were reported, including information regarding the stereochemical mixtures of synthetic samples as well as the growth rates of spherulites in PHB of varying molecular weights ranging from 9000 kg mol−1 up to 120 000 kg mol−1. The study also reported valuable information regarding the relationship between crys-tallization time, crystallization temperature, and molecular weight for synthesized PHB. High molecular weight PHB requires more time to crystallize during cooling, resulting in low values of crystallization temperature and the lowest degrees of crystallinity among the tested samples.134', 'These examples demonstrate how a change in structure can affect other PSPP relationships, such as the properties of PHAs, which are described in the following section. In general, the qualitative trends of the chemical, copolymer sequences, and morphological structure and their effects on various PHA pro-perties are known to some extent given monomer chemistry and composition. However, a fully comprehensive quantitative struc-ture–property relationship for PHAs relating their chemical syn-thesis to their structural characteristics and performance over a wide range of chemistries have not yet been fully established. This represents an exciting area of future research.', '3Properties of PHAs', '3.1Overview of PHA materials properties', 'When investigating the properties of PHAs, researchers must inherently bring the interconnected nature of PSPP relation-ships for PHAs as a complex biopolymer into consideration. As a candidate alternative to conventional plastics, the biocom-patibility, degradation rate, thermal processing and melting temperature ranges, elasticity, mechanical strength and dura-bility, and molecular permeability rates are all properties of interest in different established applications.1 In addition, the optical properties of PHAs, such as chirality, opacity or trans-parency, may also be considerations depending on the specific target performance demands.102,135 PHAs are highly biocom-patible and exhibit fully degradable and compostable (even in non-industrial composting facilities) behavior across a variety of PHA types and in different environments, both environ-mental and biological.1,17,100,136–138 PHA degradation products are completely non-toxic, and include water and carbon dioxide if oxygen is present or other molecules under anaero-bic conditions.1,102', 'Recent reviews have extensively detailed the properties of PHA-based homopolymers and copolymers, including their biodegradability and degradation rates as reported in experi-mental literature, particularly in comparison to fossil fuel-derived polymers.15,69,83 Here, we place these surveyed pro-perties of PHAs in relationship to their structure, processing, and potential performance within the framework of the materials tetrahedron. Efforts to achieve the balance of these property targets have made the landscape of PHA research a challenging and exciting field.', '3.2Thermal properties of PHAs', 'The thermal property ranges of PHAs showcase the intercon-nected nature of the materials tetrahedron for PHAs. Specifically, the glass transition and melting temperatures of PHAs are two well-investigated properties that are critical for compatibility with existing polymer processing equipment, long-term scalability, and ultimately, commercial viability.45,86 However, thermal pro-perties have also been previously shown to be a hurdle for scal-able manufacturing of PHAs.140 Three of the most important established and thoroughly-studied properties of PHAs are sum-marized in Table 1 as well as in Fig. 3, that include glass tran-sition and melting temperatures along with mechanical pro-perties such as elastic modulus (E) that will be further discussed in the mechanical properties discussion later in this section.1,45', 'In general, PHAs have melting points comparable to other well-known polymers such as PLA and polycaprolactone (PCL). PCL is well-established as a petrochemical-derived polymer that is biodegradable. PLA is also established as a bio-based polymer that is compostable in industrial facilities. However, the melting points of PHAs in general are typically lower com-pared to more conventional polymers such as PET, PS, or Nylon-6,6, as a result of their structure.141 PHAs also have gen-erally low glass transition temperatures, for instance compared to PLA (but still higher than that of PCL), as shown in Table 1.135,142 PHB is usually highly crystalline at room temp-erature: up to 95% in some reports, but commonly observed with a degree of crystallinity closer to the 50–80% range.27', 'Inherently, PHB also has a narrow melting temperature range of 160–180 °C, but typically close to 170 °C within the range of the melting temperature of PLA and higher than that of PCL, with a low glass transition temperature between 3–15 °C.1,27,27 Changes with respect to these values based on structure and composition changes are visually depicted in Fig. 3, particularly in panels a–c. It has been noted that signifi-cant degradation and molecular weight loss occurs when pro-cessing PHB above its melting point, that leads to difficulties using PHAs with conventional methods and equipment such as hot presses or extruders.40,143–145 A comprehensive quanti-tative relationship between the copolymer ratio and both the thermal and mechanical properties in isolation have been pre-viously established and prepare a framework for a more holis-tic understanding of the PSPP link between structure and resulting thermal properties.77,102,141,146', 'Adjusting side chain length and copolymer ratios is a balan-cing act for the desired application for the PHA to manage the properties and processing compatibility of the material. The design tradeoff is often applicable also in the case of overall biocompatability. A recent literature survey by Turco and col-leagues has explored how the flexibility and processability as well as thermal stability of PHB can be tuned by adjusting PHB-PHBV copolymer ratios.147 For instance, differences in the size of the repeat unit (scl vs. mcl PHAs) were shown to affect both the crystallinity and the glass transition tempera-tures of copolymer PHAs. In the case of PHB-mPHA blends, the review explored how longer chain PHAs were more likely to have lower melting temperatures. In addition, the longer chain PHAs were also shown to exhibit more amorphous regions and faster overall hydrolytic degradation rates. This was explained to be due to the amorphous regions being more susceptible regions of a semicrystalline polymer to hydrolytic attack and subsequent degradation.147', '@', '@', 'PHB: poly(3-hydroxybutyrate); P4HB: poly(4-hydroxybutyrate); PHV: poly(3-hydroxyvalerate); P4HV: poly(4-hydroxyvalerate); PHP: poly(3-hydroxypropionate);PHHx:poly(3-hydroxyhexanoate);PHO:poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate);PD:poly(3-hydroxydecanoate);PDO:poly(3-hydroxydodecanoate); LDPE: low-density polyethylene; PP: polypropylene; PET: polyethylene terephthalate; PVC: polyvinyl chloride; PEN: poly(ethylene 2,6-naphthalate); PS: polystyrene.', '@', '@', 'Copolymerization of PHB with other PHA materials, across the short, medium, and long-chain length scales can signifi-cantly alter the thermal properties of the overall material.

The authors discussed how previous investigations have reported differences in crystallite lamellae thicknesses between PHB and PHV, leading to distinct phase separations in the crystal-line ordering of the PHBV overall copolymer.148', 'Specifically, long PHA polymer chains that have well-ordered, thicker lamellae, and high crystallinity up to 80% – such as monomeric PHB – have demonstrated higher melting temperatures,whereasPHVwithitssterically-hindering additional numbers of carbons in the side chain leads to less well-ordered chains with thinner lamellae and lower melting temperatures.148 This observation in the distinct melting temperatures of PHA copolymers that can be adjusted by copo-lymer ratios can be further explored and exploited to tune the overall thermal properties of copolymerized PHAs for specific temperature ranges.', 'Either by copolymerization or blending with other addi-tives, adjusting the copolymer structure of PHAs can signifi-cantly improve thermal stability while maintaining both the degradability and mechanical properties. In terms of adjusting PHA-PHA copolymer ratios to affect the properties, generally increasing HB content can increase the glass transition and melting temperatures that generally enhance the strength, whileincreasingtheHVcontentincreases thethermal processability,56,149 as shown in Fig. 3. This trend contributes to its performance in many applications, and has been shown to also affect the overall degradation rate in both hydrolytic and enzymatic degradation environments.149', 'Recent reports have shown that by working with additives such as starch or lignin, or grafting and block copolymeriza-tion with other biopolymers such as PCL, polyethylene glycol (PEG), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), and PLA, more expan-sive results can be achieved to tune the thermal property ranges in tandem with the degradation rate,26 biocompatibil-ity,149 and mechanical strength.43,75 However, further detailed research involving structural analyses coupled with degra-dation studies may be necessary in evaluating the weight-to-polymer breakdown ratio in these PHA blended materials to ensure that the overall material is fully degrading, rather than just the PHA components degrading alone. It is well-estab-lished that the molecular weight,150 dispersity,151 and overall chemical composition152 have all also been shown to affect the thermal properties of polyesters and PHAs specifically.', '3.3Mechanical properties of PHAs', 'The mechanical strength and durability of PHAs are very important for the overall applicability of PHAs as general com-modity plastic alternatives or for biomedical applications to be able to meet the physical and structural integrity demands of the desired application. These diverse applications and prop-erty value requirement ranges may vary from disposable food packaging and single-use cutlery needs to bioresorbable sutures and hard tissue regeneration scaffolding.1 With an ultimate goal of tuning the mechanical properties of PHAs for them to serve as acceptable alternatives to other less compo-stable or less biocompatible materials such as PLA, PS, PVC, or LDPE, it is important to be aware both of the structural changes as these property values are targeted as well as their ability to meet intended performance value ranges.56,100', 'The mechanical property ranges of PHAs further demon-strate the complex structural dependence of the material and the need for PSPP-relationship focused property tuning to meet specific performance demands. Depending on the length and composition of the monomer units, PHAs have demon-strated a broad spectrum of mechanical properties. These can range from extremely soft, amorphous, and ductile mcl- and lcl-type PHAs such as poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate) (PHO) or poly (3-hydroxydodecanoate) (PHD) to the brittle and crystalline scl-type PHAs such as PHB or the very soft, yet still scl-type PHV.1,171', 'Due to its highly crystalline linear structure, PHB has not only a low glass transition temperature and narrow melting temperature window, but it is also highly brittle and stiff com-pared to other thermoplastics such as LDPE, and behaves mechanically more on the order of isotactic PP, PS or PET, with lower strain rates at failure.140,141,171 It is also more hydro-philic than PET, resulting in higher water absorption, that can be utilized in tandem with its inherent mechanical properties for changing the structural integrity of the PHB product.147Discussion on the effects of crystallization on the mechanical properties of PHBV copolymers have proposed that the amor-phous polymer chains are restricted by two subsequent crystal-lization events after solidification from melt processing.1,82These effects were found to be mitigated through the addition of nucleation agents to reduce the cracks that form in the brittle crystalline structure of PHB spherulites created during the melt processing stages.1', 'Commonly used measures of mechanical properties that have been established in the literature for PHAs include tensile strength at break (σb), tensile strength at yield (σy) and elongation at break (εb).45,171 Table 1 provides a quantitative comparison of common PHAs along with a comparison to con-ventional polymers as a reference to their mechanical pro-perties in addition to their thermal properties. The mechanical strength and durability of PHAs tend to be either comparable, or on the lower end of the performance range, when compared to more established polymers such as PLA and PCL.43,140,172', 'Comparisons are often made between PHAs, as listed in Table 1, and PLA, which itself is a typically glassy and strong but brittle polymer (Young’s modulus around 1200–2700 MPa and elongation at break around 7–20%) or more conventional polymers such as PP, with a Young’s modulus and elongation at break falling within the ranges of approximately 1600–1950 MPa and 50–160%, respectively.173–175 For employing PSPP-focused co-design principles, the idea that changing the pro-perties of PHAs should be studied not just in isolation but in tandem with their structural features, both thermal and mechanical properties, and future processing conditions is paramount.', 'For instance, blending and copolymerization with other materials is a widely used approach to achieve both broader thermal property and mechanical property ranges. These pro-perties are significantly altered with increasing copolymer ratios such as increasing HV content.1,147 The crystallinity of PHBV copolymers has been shown to decrease with increasing HV content, which in turn leads to decreased melting and glass transitions temperatures, increased strain at break, and reductions in elastic modulus.1 PHBV also has a high elonga-tion at break, in the range of 45–1080% with increasing HV copolymer ratio.109 Increasing number of carbons in monomer building blocks has been demonstrated to significantly affect the mechanical properties of PHA copolymers. In one recent report by Sohn and colleagues, the HHx monomer was shown to reduce the melting temperature of the copolymer while increasing the elongation at break.109 The resulting polymer demonstrates improved strength and flexibility through the incorporation of HHx monomers.109', 'It is important to highlight here that every change in PHA properties due to copolymerization or blending in order to yield a desired final property range inherently builds in down-stream processing compatibility changes, such as decreases in viscosity and molecular weight under extrusion.171,176The addition of non-PHA polymer chemistries has also can change the properties of hybrid PHA blends. These changes can in turn affect the processability and potentially also alter the degradation rate of the PHA, making it more or less degradable. Examples of other types of natural materials incorporated into PHA blends include corn starch, wood flour, glucose, cellulose or nanocellulose, nanoclay or nanominerals.75,76,79,83,177,178 Blending of PHAs with other polymers such as PCL and PLA will be discussed later in this review in section 4.2.', 'As a general trend, across structural and copolymer changes in both scl- and mcl-PHA types, there is a distinct tradeoff between the strength of the PHA and its ductility.45,149Blending can increase the elastic modulus of PHA materials while maintaining high levels of elongation at break, such as for P(HO-co-DO) and P(HB-co-3HHx), the latter of which has been shown to maintain an elastic modulus comparable to some types of PVC, while maintaining a much higher elonga-tion at break and lower glass transition temperature (Table 1). The structural differences in these blends, grafts, and block copolymerization with other polymers (including other PHAs) has not been demonstrated to alter the physical structure of the PHA, but rather the more mechanically durable block or component of the polymer may end up bearing more of the mechanical stress during shear, resulting in a strong and also degradable material.65,100,179,180 PHA blends are discussed in further detail in section 3 of this review.', 'There is also a high degree of variability in the mechanical properties of PHAs as a function of crystallinity. This is a very important structural characteristic of the material and can be altered in a circular manner by the processing, and potential recyclingofdegradedPHAforfeedstockinnewPHA materials.26 Not only has the crystallinity been shown to affect the strength and durability of the PHA, but previous work has shown that % crystallinity of the material also impacts the degradation rate.100,179 The mechanical properties have also been shown to change with respect to crystallinity, with a higher percent crystallinity being associated with more brittle behavior (higher elastic modulus, lower percent elongation at break) and vice versa.172,181,182', 'These relationships between the properties of PHAs and the crystallinity of the material are still being explored. For instance, one review by Kalia and colleagues describes in detail the use of additives such as nucleating agents to increase crystallization, stabilizing agents such as antioxi-dants, and plasticizers such as glycerol and sorbitol to improve the mechanical strength of PHAs while retaining its original degradation rate.86 This work has helped establish the explora-tion of the properties of PHAs with consideration to crystalli-nity as an open area for future research.86', '3.4Gas permeability of PHAs', 'The importance of the interconnected nature of PSPP relation-ships in PHA design are also highlighted by the molecular migration rates, water solubility, and diffusion barrier pro-perties. These properties are critical components of PHA bio-degradability, particularly relating their susceptibility to hydro-lytic degradation and environmental factors such as humidity, moisture, and other conditions.4,48', 'Studies of the barrier properties of PHAs are of particular importance. Due to their non-toxic degradation products, PHAs have a unique advantage to seal food and other consu-mer goods in strong barriers without the need for long-term degradationrates,industrialcompostingfacilities,and withoutharmfulmigrationofdecompositionproducts. Studies have reported these trends for PHAs while the materials are able to maintain similar water permeability values to traditional plastics such as PVC and PET.4,135,142,183The full molecular permeability and migration rates of water vapor, oxygen, and carbon dioxide have been previously reviewed in depth by Naser and colleagues, as well as other lit-erature surveys and repositories.1,4,102 However, there remains more to be explored in future work from the PSPP design per-spective for PHAs to fully articulate and quantify connections between their structure and performance.', 'The nascent commercial space for reliable and environmen-tally-friendly single use food packaging and wrapping is increasing.70,183 Some essential properties of these barriers include low oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability, low water solubility, and strong resistance to moisture to prevent spoi-lage and exposure to bacteria.157,184 For fresh fruit and veg-etables that require respiration as part of their storage, bio-derived film plastics have been shown to have a higher mole-cular migration rate than commercial plastics films, making them uniquely advantageous by removing the anaerobic environment that seals foods when conventional plastic wrap is used.185', 'PHAs in particular possess relatively low oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide permeability rates. PHAs also generally displayhighmethanolandwatervaporpermeability rates.113,135 In general, the semicrystalline chemical structures of PHAs, and PHB specifically, are hydrophobic, one of the reported rationales for their strong barrier properties. The HB and HV components of PHBV copolymers have been observed to have similar hydrophobicity values overall.1,4 It has also been shown that as HV content increases, there is a resulting decrease in crystallinity in PHBV copolymers.185', 'In addition, PHAs have the ability to out-perform other bio-derived materials such as PLA in protecting the desired product from environmental elements while not compromis-ing on overall degradability.135,142The water vapor per-meability rates of both PHB and PHBV, up to 50 wt%, have been reported to fall within the range of PS and PVC, with oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability rates far below that of PP, PS, and PVC.4 One report by Allison and colleagues demon-strated that in the case of water, the activation energy of films of PHB was similar to those presented by other semicrystalline, traditional polymers such as isotactic PP, and the high value suggested the existence of positive interactions between water molecules and the polymer matrix itself.23 For other permeat-ing molecules such as ethanol, propanol, and methanol, it has been shown that the permeability for organic vapors decreased as the size of the molecules increased.23', 'PHAs have been shown to be completely biodegradable in all environments, including home compost, septic systems, and municipal solid waste systems, without significant change to their permeability properties depending on environmental conditions.135,157 In one test under ASTM D5511 and 37 °C, 70–100% biodegradation of PHBV was achieved relative to the cellulose control.177 These properties have been discussed to arise from the structural and surface property differences in PHAs compared to other commonly used biopolymers such as PLA. Potential future studies involving modification of the inherent properties of the polymer indicate that this is an active area of ongoing research which can explore many excit-ing possibilities relating the structure of the PHA to its gas and moisture barrier properties.186,187', 'Future work in this area must also seek to understand how the barrier properties of PHAs and copolymerized PHAs with other materials may change with long-term storage or shelf-life degradation, and further quantify how these materials also change with storage at different temperatures beyond room temperature. For instance, how the barrier properties of these materials will change after storage in a hot car, or in the freezer for an extended period of time to ensure the efficacy and safety of products at different storage temperatures. These consumer-use questions are of particular importance to the commercial development of PHAs as products, but also lead to significant interest for better understanding the structural changes taking place in these different temperatures for real-world use and practicality and how they affect the barrier properties.', 'From both functional and consumer aesthetic perspectives, materials serving as films employed as packaging materials are expected to possess both UV protection and high transpar-ency, in addition to their strong barrier properties.188 In one recent study, Ferri and colleagues blended PHBV copolymer with hydrophilic additives, up to 10 wt% tannin concentration, using solvent casting to prepare films to be stable at shelf, refrigerator, and freezer temperatures.188 These films were observed to have elastic modulus and tensile strength values within the same ranges as PLA and PS, and while increasing tannin content was found to lower film transparency, a com-promise between transparency and UV protection was achieved at an intermediate concentration of tannins.188 The anti-oxidant activities of the blended polymers were also improved in addition to a decrease in carbon dioxide and oxygen per-meability. Finally, the PHBV/tannin blend could also deter-mine ammonia vapor using a color-change indicator that was investigated for its potential to determine concentration of ammonia as a food spoilage indicator.188', 'Previous discussion of how permeation of small molecules can only proceed into the amorphous regions of a polymer has lead to some interesting design perspectives. Modifications to the crystallinity or the free volume of the polymer can also modify the diffusion paths for the small molecules. In a study by Genovesi and colleagues, blends of PHB copolymers, including PHBHHx and poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybu-tyrate (PHB-4HB), were examined in extruded, cast films. The study was organized to compare the increasing percentage of PHB-4HB to monomeric PHBHHx in terms of the oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor permeability rates.185 The increased percentage of amorphous PHB-4HB copolymer in the PHBHHx blend contributed an increased oxygen per-meability rate.185 While improving the mechanical properties of films or altering the thermal processing range of PHAs, sig- nificant changes to the gas permeability rates may also occur, and they must be taken into consideration when optimizing the performance of these materials.', 'These findings are important to establishing a relationship between the structural elements of PHAs. This relationship affectsmanyinterconnectedpropertyandperformance metrics from a PSPP co-design perspective. Future studies will continue to explore these established relationships, particu-larly focusing on relating these rates in a quantitative way to the overall degradation rate of the material for long-term shelf life stability.', 'The full suite of structure–property relationships relating side chain length, polymer backbone, chemical nature of func-tional groups, morphology and stereochemistry to their physi-cal properties is still a relatively new concept in biopolymer design.

The latter will serve as the main focus of our present processing discussion due to this being the current most widespread method for tailoring the pro-perties of PHAs after synthesis.83,168 Both topics also offer a huge range of potential for future research and exploration and are both similarly relevant in the commercial space, par-ticularly for future research in which models of polymer pro-cessing suitability conditions may be developed with ML.', '4.1Processing of PHAs by chemical, thermal, and mechanical methods', 'The processing history of the material can directly impact the molecular weight and materials properties of two PHA poly-mers with the same structure and the same copolymer ratio.80,169 These processing steps may include methods com-monly used with conventional polymers such as solvent casting or drop casting, extrusion, electrospinning, and hot pressing PHA granules.119,141,144,227 The extent of the differ-ence between the final properties of the material will vary depending on the depth and variety of the processing history it is subjected to, as well as the conditions the material experi-enced during the collection of the material from the bioreactor or other synthesis source.144,227 Both of these processing history stages must be taken into account when examining the resulting properties.', 'Solvent or solution casting is one of the most widely used processingmethodstocreatePHAfilms.228–231Inthis approach, raw PHA granules are dissolved in an organic solvent and cast into a mold to prepare films of varying thicknesses.230,232 Chloroform is one of the most common sol-vents used for solution casting and glass molds are also one of the most typical mold types used in laboratory settings.230,232Solvent casting can be used exclusively or in combination with another processing technique, such as electrospinning or hot pressing, the latter of which is common to prepare samples for mechanical testing.230 Other common fabrication and proces-sing methods for developing PHA materials, particularly for packaging applications, include melt mixing, blending, or other compounding techniques, melt extrusion, compression molding, and electrospinning (particularly for blends with cellulose).231', 'Tanaka and colleagues recently illustrated the combined processing effects on the properties of PHAs.

Molecular weight was reported to increase up to 279 kDa (PHB-co-3HHx) from 55 kDa (PHB) and 35 kDa (control PHB), and dispersity index was also shown to increase with the additional processing step adding the hot press.232 The film thickness and elastic modulus both increased significantly for hot pressed samples compared to those that were only solvent cast. The crystalliza-tion temperature was also shown to decrease by up to 40 °C above the starting PHB, along with a decreased degradation rate.232 In other solvent casting studies, drying in an atmo-sphere saturated with the solvent was used to achieve uniform mechanical properties and avoid internal stress formations.144', 'Building on the solvent casting technique, Kang and col-leagues investigated oxygen plasma glow discharge after casting PHB films and the subsequent interaction with human fibroblasts.233 This process can be used to graft polyethylene oxide onto the film to introduce grafted acrylic acid groups and immobilize insulin for an attachment and proliferation study with human fibroblast cells for tissue culture. The control, unprocessed film and the oxygen plasma cleaned film were shown to have significant differences in cell attachment and proliferation due to the changes in hydrophobicity and roughness on the surface of the material. The prepared film was found to be similar to that of similarly prepared poly-urethane and PLA substrates, presenting opportunities for bio-based alternatives with similar properties.233', 'In addition to plasma discharge, there has been work inves-tigating how various other processing steps can improve the biological compatibility of bio-derived polyesters. Burkhardt and colleagues recently compared procedures for PHB, PLA, and polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) thermal anneal-ing approximately 20 °C below the melting temperature.234 This was done to reorganize the amorphous regions of the semicrystalline polymers into more crystalline zones. The study examined the warping behavior of the polymers after steam sterilization at 134 °C, below the melting temperature of monomeric PHB, and demonstrated how mineral fillers such as calcium carbonate experienced reduced warping behavior during the process. In addition, the samples also exhibited accelerated degradation after steam sterilization.234', 'This example shows how the PSPP relationships may be taken into account for design. It represents the results of a combination of processing methods significantly changing the structure of the PHA. This change impacts the overall pro-perties, and can lead to improved performance and biocom-patibility of the PHA such as in extrusion-based manufactur-ing. By incorporating more than one aspect of the PSPP tetra-hedron, experiments may be able to be more efficiently designed.234', '4.2Processing of PHAs by blending', 'To overcome the inherent property restrictions of naturally-occuring PHAs, one approach is to utilize copolymerization and blending of PHAs with other materials.75,154,243 For instance, a common method of PHA processing involves adjusting copolymer ratios of PHA-PHA copolymers during synthesis or in the initial pellet processing to adjust the thermal processing window. The overall melting temperature of the PHBV copolymer is lower than PHB monomer, and various copolymer ratios of HB and HV experiencing other pro-cessing histories including extrusion and compression (hot press) molding have been previously explored.141,145 In an example, Larsson and colleagues used a twin screw extrusion device to vary the melt temperature, rotation speed, and copo-lymer (PHB-co-P4HB) ratios and examined changes in blend morphology, thermal and glass transition temperatures, and viscoelastic properties.141 All samples experienced a decrease in the glass transition and melting temperatures, a decrease in the crystallinity, and an increase in the dynamic shear modulus (indicating a more elastic material) compared to the starting control material.141 A summary of the property changes that result from blends of PHB with other PHA mono-mers, other biomacromolecules, and various conventional polymers are provided in Table 2.', 'These copolymer ratio adjustments performed by blending can dramatically change processing a PHA when utilizing exist-ing conventional polymer processing equipment. This process ultimately dictates applications in which the material can be used.151,235 PHAs compatible with existing polymer processing equipment that can be used for other polymers as well are also less expensive. For example, monomeric or overly high ratios of hydroxyvalerate (HV) co-monomer (over about 40%) make the polymer overly soft, sticky, and unsuitable for processes such as injection-molding.56,244,245 Therefore, the copolymer ratio, both with other PHAs and with other materials, is typi-cally seen as one of the most important processing factors for PHAs.75,235', 'In addition to PHA homopolymers and PHA–PHA organized block or random copolymers, there have been previous PHA processing studies that have altered the structure of existing PHAbio-basedpolymerswithothertypesofbiological materials.76,177 Some examples of such blended materials include PLA, starch, lignin, and cellulose as blends with com-mercial or lab-produced PHB to produce new, combined structures.75,83 Lugoloobi and colleagues utilized a blend of lignin and PHB developed using Pickering emulsion and formed films via thermal compression.178 The overall crystalli-nity of the film was increased as well as the elastic modulus and tensile strength while retaining a similar degradation rate to the base polymers, but making it more brittle than either in the process.178', 'Valentini and colleagues have explored the influence of blending with fibrillated nanocellulose on the degradation rate and thermal properties of PHBHHx.79 The authors produced the PHBHHx blend via ultrasonication and solution mixing with an increasing cellulose concentration ranging from 0.5 wt% to 3 wt%.79 Elastic modulus and tensile strength reached a maximum increase at the 0.5 wt% concentration, and decreased with increasing concentrations of cellulose, lim-iting the benefits of incorporating additional cellulose beyond that point. No influence on the thermal properties or degra-dation rate was observed with the addition of the nanocellu-lose.79 These studies highlight the need to better understand and quantify the interactions at the microscopic and meso-scopic level between PHAs and other bio-based polymers to develop a more consistent co-design relationship of how the additional biopolymer affects the structure of the blend.', '@', '@', 'Studies have explored changes in PHA structure by blending PHBwithothermaterials,includingsyntheticallymade materials. For instance, biopolymers made by synthetic syn-thesis reactions such as polyvinyl alcohol, PEG, and PCL have been blended with PHAs. In addition, more traditional poly-mers such as PET, PS, and HDPE have also been blended with PHAs, and each has resulted in different biodegradation rates than the original neat homopolymers by themselves.75,141,235These blending approaches aim to keep the original degra-dation profile of the material consistent without sacrificing the changes to the physical properties achieved through blend-ing, such as mechanical strength and thermal stability. Enhancing the overall materials properties such as durability, elasticity, or expanding the thermal processing window are typically aims of blending. Retaining the degradation rate for specific applications is often also a consideration.48,65,100,179', 'For instance, Larsson and colleagues blended both homo-polymeric PHB and block copolymer P(HB-co-4HB) (PHB4HB) with PBAT using melt extrusion.141 The melting temperature of the blend decreased with increasing PBAT composition, while glass transition temperature and shear storage modulus increased with increasing PBAT composition with a wide range of variability in sample results. However, there were distinct phase domains of homopolymer PHB visible in a continuous PBAT matrix. This result indicated immiscibility. Dicumyl per-oxide, a compatibilizer, was added in situ during extrusion. The overall miscibility and blend properties of the polymer were improved by this addition.141', 'In another study, Tamiya and colleagues examined a blend of PHBHHx with PS that were grafted together to make a film that was shown to be heterogeneous, opaque, and brittle, showing similar immiscibility between PHAs and synthetic polymers.236 However, when modified using propargyl-termi-nated PHBHHx and azide-modified PS, the films exhibited improved homogeneity, transparency, and improved elastic modulus and tensile strength compared to the previous grafted blend or the PHBHHx alone.236 These processing studies indicate the need for an additional compatibilizer or Cu-catalyzed azide–alkyne cyclo-addition reactions. Both of these methods are very well understood processes, but these techniques may not always be environmentally sustainable or economical for scaling up the process in industrial and com-mercial settings.180', 'Single-layered PHB monomeric films have often been shown to be too brittle for mechanical analyses.240 To create a single-layered homopolymer film, PHB granules were blended with PCL by solvent casting. The as-cast film was then hot- pressed in a mold. Comparing untreated controls with the single-layered PCL film and heat treated multi-layered PHB-co-PCL polymers, the tensile strength and elastic modulus of the single layer PCL film was slightly higher, but the multi-layered copolymer film was shown to be more elastic with a higher yield at break, indicating shifts in the properties for PHA copo-lymer films depending on processing history.240 PHAs in general, and particularly homopolymeric PHB, are often blended with PCL or other materials in various forms to custo-mize the thermal processing range, degradation rate, and mechanical strength of the blend by taking advantage of the different properties between the materials.86', 'Investigating potential processing techniques and optional blending strategies to achieve desired property ranges will be helpful for future work. A clear next step in developing the PSPP relationship between structure, properties, and proces-sing for PHAs is to begin to establish these kinds of holistic quantitative relationships that connect each of these features. Some examples have already started to establish a framework forfutureinvestigations.Theseexistingstudiesinclude explorations of film-forming processes and their effect on the resulting transport properties,239 the structural and property differences between wet-spun and melt-spun fibers,246 and the effects of thermal pre-processing steps on molecular weight changes.243', 'The physical way the PHA structure is altered during the processing stage from raw PHA granule to a usable product form is crucial to developing an understanding of how the overall materials design process can be streamlined for PHAs because of the direct impact on the material properties. For example, exploring the correlations between the number of carbons in the side chain and polyester backbone, the func-tional groups within each component of PHA, and how these factors influence the resulting properties of the material are all important considerations.', '5Performance of PHAs', 'The performance of a material is defined as its capability to meet a given set of requirements to function reliably in a desired role over a certain period.51 Performance metrics or cri-teria are often determined by its suite of properties and conse-quently how well suited the material is for the target appli-cation.226 In this regard the performance is usually discussed in the context of a particular application. In the context of PSPP relationships, many times the performance goal for PHAs will be to optimize the properties within the current standards of conventional plastic materials such that the PHA will serve as an effective alternative.', 'PHAs are currently most widely commercially produced for two broad categories of applications: biomedical products and food packaging or other consumer products.135,183,247 More recently, developments have also been made for PHA appli-cations using additive manufacturing to improve their per-formance.248 This section aims to provide: (1) an overview of how PHAs are used in these three major fields, and some insights into other potential applications that extend beyond the scope of these three areas, (2) the performance metrics by which they are evaluated according to their properties and other PSPP relationships for each field, (3) and finally, present some opportunities for future research and additional areas of PHA applicability to continue to increase the performance potential of PHAs going forward in each field.', '5.1PHAs in biomedical applications', 'PHAs in biomedical applications are some of the widely researched areas of applications for PHAs. Biodegradability and non-toxicity are crucial properties that make PHAs ideal for use as biocompatible materials that break down in the body naturally, and relates to their physical structure and inherent properties. These properties have generated much excitement for their use in the biomedical field.48,81,86,179Research on PHAs in various applications ranging from cardio-vascular, nerve, bone tissue engineering constructs and drug delivery systems to artificial skin and beyond have been exten-sively explored. This research has been recently thoroughly reviewed in several recent reports.86,249', 'PHAs show other major biological advantages compared with traditional synthetic polymers in these spaces, with par-ticular interest in their biocompatibility and low thrombogeni-city.81 Furthermore, an additional benefit is their degradation mechanism since the local pH value during degradation of PHAs has been shown to remain unchanged.118,250 This makes them well tolerated by cells and the immune system compared to other clinically used polymers, such as PLA and PCL.81,173Additional steps as described in the processing section of this review can further alter the properties of PHAs to tailor their performance to meet specific demands in these applications.', 'There are several representative performance metrics for PHAs as a biomaterial. PHB in particular has been previously evaluated for its ability to facilitate cell seeding, adhesion, pro-liferation, differentiation, and promote de novo tissue regener-ation by Zinn and colleagues.118 In terms of providing physio-logical support, PHA copolymers have been investigated as a variety of tissue scaffolds (most notably for bone tissue engineering).81,250PHBV-hydroxyapatitecomposites,for instance, have comparable physical and chemical similarities with human bones and serve as an excellent implant candidate for bone scaffolds and also recently, potential for artificial tendon composite materials.63,251', 'Not limited only to these applications, composite develop-ment of PHAs with bio-glass has also drawn recent research interest in the effort of perfecting the material for hard tissue engineering implants, as well as for PHA-bioceramic compo-sites for bone drug delivery.137,250 In these examples, the major emphasis is often not on the thermal property proces-sing ranges of PHAs (although performance related to local heating or ablation technology has been investigated), but rather on the trade-off between their degradation rate and mechanical durability as performance metrics.172', 'Soft tissue implants and regeneration platforms are also of particular interest for PHAs, demonstrating the diversity of potential PHA applications.252,253 Trakunjae and colleagues have recently demonstrated how the mechanical properties of PHBHHx can be tuned to eliminate surrounding healthy tissue modulus mismatch and promote skin tissue regeneration.151 A survey of recent work examining PHAs in tissue engineering by Pulingam and colleagues explored PHAs as wound dressing materials.253 The reported formulations of PHAs include incor-porated gelatin, collagen, and keratin-impregnated P4HB elec-tronspun nanofiber meshes and scaffolds. These impregnated meshes are used to promoted changes in both the hydrophobi-city of the material as well as in its mechanical properties. Subsequently, these changes promoted adhesion and prolifer-ation of murine fibroblast cells during in vivo studies. The results suggested up to a 35% increase in wound healing over 14 day studies compared to controls.253 In addition, the piezo-electric effect exhibited by PHAs has also been used for explor-ing nerve tissue regeneration using PHB scaffolds and induc-tionofelectricalpropertiesbythermalormechanical stress.254,255 Additional studies and uses of the piezoelectric effect in PHB will be discussed in section 5.4.', 'Other important performance considerations with regard to using PHAs as a biomedical material is in both their federal approval for use and encapsulation efficiency.231 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration provided approval for the use of PHB in absorbable sutures for surgical applications in 2007.256 This approval marked the progress of PHB meeting the general standards of accepted performance in medical and commercial use applications. Applications of PHB in various biomedical applications have been well-documented since then.257–260 In terms of their encapsulation efficiency, and therefore potential to be used as drug delivery agents, miscibil-ity with various solvents is also an important performance feature specific to the biomedical use space.250', 'PHB was previously used to encapsulate a drug for con-trolled drug delivery, with the aim to adjust the material degra-dation rate over time to control the release kinetics of the compound.81,250 In studies to further the development of PHB nanoparticles to encapsulate the anticancer drug, docetaxel, Vardhan and colleagues as well as Luo and colleagues have exploited the hydrophobicity of PHB coupled with poly(lactide-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA).261,262 The encapsulation efficiency was shown to increase when a higher percentage of PHB was used, opening the path forward for future research to expand on these studies.261', 'There has been extensive research and reviews published in the area of PHAs for biomedical use, and it is a rapidly expand-ing field with a nascent commercial space.253,263 Future studies can benefit from input regarding a detailed quantitat-ive PSPP relationship using the wealth of property data that already exists to optimize PHA materials selection, along with the incorporation of data science approaches such as ML data-sets that can utilize or incorporate previously published litera-ture reviewed for a particular application, such as absorbable sutures.250', '5.2PHAs as food (bulk) packaging and consumer plastics', 'The food packaging, food storage, and disposable products industries are currently the most extensively studied, economi-cally viable, and fastest-growing fields for PHAs.57,247 Both PHB and PHBHHx were approved by the U.S. FDA for food contact in 2017.274 PHAs have been studied extensively and commercially used as everyday household disposable items such as bottles, food wrappers, diapers, pens, cutlery and uten-sils, and containers.142,183,252,266,275 Flexible PHA packaging materials, including bags, envelopes, pouches, and wraps made of easily yielding and deformable materials such as single-layer films, foils, or paper sheeting that can be filled and sealed are some other common examples.86,136,266,275 PHA polymers in food packaging are typically used to surround the contents completely, securing its contents from gases and vapors, moisture, and bacterial or other biological effects of the outside environment. These types of products are used as a barrier to keep dirt, germs, liquids or gases on one side of the film. This is an ideal example for utilizing the unique pro-perties of biodegradable PHAs in consumer applications (sum-marized in Table 3).57,238,266', 'There are several important properties and performance metrics considered for PHAs to be used in food packaging applications. These applications necessitate good barrier pro-perties such as a low permeation rate, which is obtained with a combination of a thin film, low diffusivity, as well as low solubility and increased crystallinity, which relate to the struc- ture of the material.238,265 Kumari and colleagues recently pro-vided a detailed review regarding the current properties of sus-tainable packaging materials such as PHB and starch-based polymers.237 Diffusion coefficients generally decreased with increased HV copolymer content, that decreased the overall crystallinity.237 The physical barrier properties of PHA films have also been explored recently using the addition of in-organic laminar nanofillers such as nanoclays, or organic nanoparticles of starch and cellulose.237,238', 'ThesePHAcompositefilmsdemonstrateddecreased oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor permeability rates as compared to LDPE, PP, PVC, and PS controls. These types of modifications to the structure of the PHA enhanced the barrier propertiescomparedtothecontrolconventional polymers.237,238 Note that the low permeability values for oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor are generally of great interest when optimizing properties for food packaging, as dis-cussed in section 3.4. In addition, another performance metric of interest is the degradation rate of the PHA, without the resulting toxic byproducts such as microplastics as is the case withconventionalpetroleum-basedandothersynthetic plastic, or the need for expensive industrial composting facili-ties as is the case for other commercially available bio-derived plastic alternatives.57,136,275', 'All property values for PHAs must fall within the perform-ance metric ranges for conventional materials in order to be considered a suitable alternative. PHAs are required to at least meet or exceed the mechanical strength of the materials they would replace and be at least compatible with the same thermal processing ranges as the incumbant materials.70,265This is often the case to assist with ensuring manufacturing and processing equipment capability for replacing the poly-mers with PHAs, and for practicality. In a report by Fabra and colleagues, crystallinity, thermal, mechanical, optical, anti-bac-terial, and barrier properties were all examined for PEG-PHBV, PHB, and PHBV films over the course of three months for both single-layer and electrospun multi-layer food packaging proto-types.265 Multilayer films became stiffer, less deformable, and slightly more crystalline with higher barrier properties for oxygen transport than single-layer films across all samples, and storage time did not significantly alter these properties.265', '@', '@', 'Anti-bacterial and anti-viral studies of PHAs in various applications have been recently comprehensively surveyed by Ladhari and colleagues.231 These studies have explored the potential for agents and processing procedures that may be incorporatedintoPHAdesigntoenhanceperformance. Examples of these steps for anti-bacterial treatment include plasma cleaning or nanofibers integrated with anti-bacterial agents. Protonated amino groups, nanoparticles, and other substances may serve as these anti-bacterial agents.231 This indicates that the holistic effects and PSPP relationships for each set of properties and the processing steps leading to the final commercial product are important to take into consider-ation when designing food packaging materials using PHAs.', 'The inherent PSPP relationships of PHAs have provided several advantages over other competing bio-derived materials. However, current design challenges such as economic feasi-bility and commercial scaling for food packaging in particular still hinder widespread use of PHAs as alternatives to conven-tional plastic materials. PHA performance as it relates to the structure, properties, and processing history of the product may be more thoroughly examined in future studies using ML and polymer informatics to approach co-design principles in a more quantitative, comprehensive way. As discussed in detail earlier in section 3.5, there have been recent efforts towards establishing a method for multi-property ML predictions specifically targeted for screening PHAs to compare with other conventional and other bio-based plastics for common com-mercial applications.219', 'To design PHAs and other bio-derived materials that can reliably perform in the commodity plastics market, the PSPP relationships must be established in these ways.

For instance, one recent study employed fused filament fabrication with different polyester blends, including PHB, to improve the thermal characteristics of the material after printing, anneal-ing, and sterilization, demonstrating significantly improved mechanical features and durability in the end products.234', 'One of the most widely-regarded advantages of additive manufacturing techniques that cannot be easily achieved by other methods is that it provides the on-demand fabrication of tailor-made products.268 Particularly in the biomedical space, additive manufacturing offers means to develop customized products for tissue regeneration, such as in cardiac tissue, car-tilage and vascular repair, and wound dressings, in addition to promisingtherapeuticsforhardtissueregeneration.268Developing PHAs with additive manufacturing is advantageous due to this highly customizable nature of the polymer. There is a wide range of high-resolution geometries, rapid prototyp-ing for patient-specific needs, and custom property value ranges that might otherwise necessitate resource-intensive handmade molds.82', 'Although there are exciting advantages for using PHAs with additive manufacturing, there are some environmental chal-lenges that present opportunities for future research. To be a fully circular loop for sustainability, the additive manufactur-ing process requires the use of PHA and other material fila-ments, inks, and resins, that must utilize the properties of PHAs in order to be fully biodegradable.82 However, the energy, computational cost, and other support materials required by these processes offer other areas for future research to expand on the sustainability of using additive man-ufacturing for PHAs.234,267 Many of the other limitations for additive manufactured PHAs are based on their performance, that is currently constrained by the inherent structure and physical properties of the PHA or PHA blend. For instance, PHB and its copolymers are often limited by their compressive strength,thermalprocessingranges,solubility,andcell adhesion, cell differentiation and specialization, and cell pro-liferation rates.267,268', 'However, there have been novel approaches to overcoming these limitations while maintaining the benefits of additive manufacturing that have utilized awareness of PSPP relation-ships.

Specifically, a broad scope of research covering the filaments for raw materials for use in 3D printing, inks, and resins based on biomaterials or other renewable resources was reported.267 The discussion of property selection for the starting materials such as inks and filaments combined with the processing vari-ables was of particular interest from a PSPP relationship perspective.', 'Using methods described in various studies throughout their report, overall performance of additive manufactured PHAs were improved compared to neat PHB in solvent-cast films, particularly with regard to uniformity of the final material.267 For example, melt blending of PHBV with 20 wt% calcium sulfate hemihydrate followed by additive manufactur-ing with an FDM system significantly improved the rigidness and hydrophilicity of the PHBV scaffolds. These methods provide an approach to overcoming property limitation chal-lenges in porous scaffolds for hard tissue engineering.267 The ability to tailor the geometry of the final products, tune the mechanical properties, and improve hydrophilicity for cell compatibility have all been reported as advantages of additive manufacturing for PHA biopolymers and blends.82 Several cases of these blends, such as with alginate, lignin, beeswax, cellulose, and poly(urethane acrylate), have demonstrated improvedperformanceinspecificbiomedical applications.82,269', 'In addition to blends, composites of PHA materials with other materials have demonstrated potential in additive manu-facturing.NovelPHBHHx-fibrillatednanocellulosebio-degradable composites for additive manufacturing have been produced and characterized by Valentini and colleagues.79Composite filaments having a nanofiller concentration of 0.5 wt%, 1 wt% and 3 wt% were then extruded, characterized and used in fused deposition modeling.79 The presence of fibrillated nanocellulose did not affect the thermal degra-dation behavior of the materials, nor were the glass transition and the melting temperatures influenced.79 This study marked a promising approach to overcoming the current limitations of PHA processing by utilizing new polymerization techniques in combination with other biopolymers (such as nanocellulose used here).79', 'Additive manufacturing of PHAs is an emerging field of study that is rapidly expanding. Within the past five years, many studies have established specific methods such as fused deposition modeling to assist in tailoring PHAs and PHAs blended with other materials to achieve specific mechanical properties and improve their overall performance, particularly in biomedical applications.

Combined with metal oxide nanofillers as a stabil-izer, these copolymers have been shown to display both good flame retardancy and mechanical properties.28 This is another exciting and unique feature that distinguishes PHAs from other types of commercial biopolymers. Finally, other recent studies have included exploring PHAs for use in biocomposites and as nanocomposites or nanoparticles with other inorganic and organic materials with the goal of improving the overall degradation and biocompatibility of the desired applications.28There is much potential for future expansion into other appli-cations not listed here. Future work will certainly utilize the relationships between the structure, properties, processing, and performance of PHAs for a more comprehensive under-standing of biopolymer design and to explore these yet undis-covered applications.', '6Discussion and future outlook', 'In traditional implementations of the materials science tetra-hedron, the PSPP relationships have been essential for not only providing a framework for an improved understanding of the fundamental concepts, but also for establishing best prac-tices towards the rational design and optimization of novel and existing materials.51,52 In this review, we have leveraged this classic framework towards discussing the potential of future research with PHAs.

We suggest that the next steps for PHA materials development must incorporate a holistic approach to design by taking into consideration the PSPP relationships outlined in this review in order to reduce these costs.', 'The concept of “co-design” principles must be paramount going forward. For example, future work investigating the cost-effectiveness of the PHA production process must take into account the genetic and biological compatibility of the PHA producing organism strains, carbon sources, and the fermen-tation and bioreactor processes. These future studies should also take into account the utilization of waste feedstock, raw material processing, and resource recovery features all within the same experimental (or data-enabled) framework to design PHAs that possess the desired property portfolio for a target application.28', 'For instance, previously examined biosynthesis factors and production potential of PHAs using different carbon sources, microorganisms, and nutrient limitations as experimental factors have been well-documented on their own individually andinrelationtoeachotherfromabiosynthetic standpoint.20,86,100,125 However, as with the structural and morphological aspects of PHAs and their relationship to PHA properties, a quantifiable, comprehensive relationship that considers each of the three major PHA-structure biosynthesis factors (microbe type, carbon source, and nutrient limitations) and the resulting PHAs that each combination produces has not yet been fully established.', 'Clarifying these biosynthesis factors which affect the struc-ture of PHAs has the potential to enhance the overall design process of PHAs by establishing a PSPP relationship between how the material is biologically or synthetically prepared, its resulting structure, and the subsequent properties. Future studies would benefit from establishing such a relationship. Continued exploration will ideally also consider cost-effective biosynthesis techniques to access and control these specific structures.', 'With regard to the use of data-enabled design and ML, this is one area that we place an emphasis on understanding the experimental implications and physical meaning of results. Ideally, ML may be implemented in future work to streamline and optimize laboratory processes and synthesis schemes. We recommend a goal of tailoring the desired properties of PHAs specifically to meet desired property ranges for optimized per-formance in desired applications using these existing design strategies in polymer informatics with an awareness of PSPP relationships.189', 'Future research may also seek to break down the PSPP co-design principle into even smaller pieces, to still examine ways to expedite PHA research and development in more simple ML models. Such future explorations may include: (1) a surrogate model-based prediction using ML, and generated by polymer-and bio-informatics models, to develop a predictive and quan-titative understanding of the PSPP relationships, (2) an experi-mental design approach that leverages active learning and informatics-based approaches to more efficiently investigate and validate theoretical predictions of the thermal, mechanical and other relevant properties, (3) the design of possible models and predictive analysis of optimized processing con-ditions for PHAs and other biopolymers to ensure their com-patibility with existing industrial polymer processing equip-ment, and (4) further experimentation and ML model combi-nationsincorporatingnovelorenhancedmicroorganism strains to improve the PHA productivity and yield via genetic engineering.28,239', 'Increased focus on environmentally-friendly production and processing processes, from synthesis and fermentation to more efficient and reliable downstream recovery strategies are still needed, and are currently open areas for future study and exploration.273 The thermal properties, mechanical durability, and barrier properties of PHAs must be investigated in tandem, rather than in isolation, as per the co-design prin-ciples of the materials tetrahedron to develop a more quanti-tative understanding of PSPP mappings. In this way, research-ers may be able to address that processing conditions are ulti-mately suitable to achieve the target performance. In addition, the economic sustainability of each of these interconnected aspectsofthematerialsdesignprocessmustalsobe considered.5,238', 'Despite several outstanding challenges that currently exist as road blocks towards commercialization and widespread use of PHAs, the future of this class of biopolymers remains bright. There is tremendous potential for PHAs to become a mainstream alternative to conventional plastics in a wide range of applications as both an environmentally and econ-omically friendly material. The community has an exciting opportunity to utilize state-of-the art experimental methods and novel polymer informatics approaches to create a new framework for understanding bio-derived polymers with a PSPP-focused perspective to create timely and impactful solu-tions to global concerns for everyday life.', 'Author contributions', 'J.L. prepared and organized the manuscript and provided references.

2025-04-03 04:18:30 - WARNING: ['Synthesis of periodic polyolefins based on anionic alternating copolymerization†', 'Hong Yan, Hongyuan Bai, Xuefei Wang, Haitao Leng, Siwei Chen, Li Hanand Hongwei Ma*', 'To avoid sequence bias in the chain growth process of multicomponent periodic polymers, we reportedan indirect method for the synthesis of strictly periodic polymers using nonpolar monomers. Using 1,1-diphenylethylene (DPE) as the comonomer, the precise sequence was achieved through living anionic polymerization (LAP) and hydrogenation. Four dienes (isoprene (Ip), 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene (DMBD),2,3-diphenylbutadiene-1,3-diene (DPB), and 1-phenyl-1,3-butadiene (1-PB)) and an olefin with cyclictension 1-cyclobutylvinylbenzene (CBVB) were copolymerized with DPE to prepare the alternating pre-cursors. The periodic sequences of DPE–styrene–propylene (pd-DSP), DPE–propylene–propylene (pd-DPP), DPE–ethylene–styrene (pd-DES), DPE–styrene–styrene (pd-DSS) and DPE–ethylene–styrene–styrene (pd-DESS) were successfully synthesized with hydrogenation of these alternating precursors, and the nonpolar olefin units were successfully introduced into the periodic polymer. The results showed thatthe modification of the backbone carbon framework structure caused a consistent change in the thermalproperties of the polymers. Moreover, the steric hindrance and arrangement density of the side chain substituents could significantly affect the performance of the periodic copolymers. This study provides afeasible method for the synthesis of non-polar periodic copolymers with precise periodic arrangements.', 'Introduction', 'The sequence structure of polymers forms the basis for the expression of their properties.1–3 Among various sequences, periodicpolymersare composed ofmultiplemonomers arranged in a regular pattern, as well as the side chain groups.4–6 Therefore, compared with other sequences such as random, block, or gradient distributions, the ordered structure of periodic polymers can better guide the folding and assem-bly of the polymer chains. They exhibit wide applicability in emerging fields such as drug delivery, battery storage and optical components.7–10 Various types of periodic polymers often have defective structures, because it is difficult for mul-tiple types of monomers to undergo strict crossover reactions according to the preset requirements.11 Therefore, only in the polymerization of two monomers, alternating sequences can beobtainedbysuppressingthehomo-propagation reactions.12–14Constructingalternatingsequencesisan effective method to obtain precise periodic sequences.', 'Step-growth polymerization employs efficient orthogonal reactions between the functional groups to achieve precise and strict sequences, which can prevent the formation of defective structures; click reactions and multicomponent reactions are widely used in the construction of alternating structures. For example, the Ugi, CuAAC and Passerini reactions have been used to synthesize complex periodic sequences such as [ABCB], [ABCBA] and [ABCDCB].15–18 However, step-growth polymerization can only yield precise sequences of oligomers. Furthermore, in the preparation of high molecular weight peri-odic copolymers, combining step-growth polymerization and chain-growth polymerization is more promising and challen-ging. For example, current research has achieved the synthesis of periodic copolymers possessing [ABC], [ABBA], and [ABBCD] repeating structures by the combination of reversible-de-activationradicalpolymerizations(RDRPs)andcoupling reactions.19–22 In addition, radical coupling reactions (RACPs) have also been reported to prepare periodic copolymers with [ABC], [ABAC], and [ABCC] repeating structures.23,24 The above methods are capable of obtaining relatively precise periodic structures that require a combination of multiple mechanisms and rely on the special functional groups of monomers. For non-polar polymers, none of the above methods are appli-cable. Living ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) is an extremely efficient synthesis strategy to produce periodic non-polar polymers. Based on the information from periodic sequences, it is necessary to design and construct the required macrocyclicolefinsandthenobtainperiodicsequences through ring opening metathesis polymerization of mono-mers, such as the periodic sequences of styrene, ethylene, or propylene.25–27 Based on this theoretical foundation, our research group developed a new method for carbon skeleton regulation in previous studies. The styrene derivatives with cyclic substituents underwent anion-migrated ring-opening polymerization, followed by hydrogenation, and we success-fully synthesized polymers with pd-SEM and pd-SEE periodic sequence structures.28 This method was able to achieve the goal of obtaining strictly precise periodic sequences through chain polymerization.', 'Inspired by this work, apart from homopolymers, only alter-nating polymers can also achieve strict sequence control by chainpolymerization.Assumingthatmultiplenonpolar olefins are directly copolymerized through chain growth to obtain periodic structures, the insertion of monomer units is determined by the reactivity ratio, which is controlled by temp-erature and solvent;29–32 thus, perfect periodic insertion is impossible. Furthermore, owing to the influence of dynamics, the precision of the sequence sharply decreases during the polymerization process until the sequence structure becomes statistically random. However, in various types of copolymer sequence control, only alternating sequences can be strictly achieved; perfect alternation will occur when both r1 and r2 are equal to zero, or when r1r2 = 0, alternating sequences can also be obtained. Therefore, the problem of statistical randomness can be avoided by synthesizing a strict alternating structure andfunctionalizingthisstructuretoobtainaperiodic structure.33', 'This process provides an indirect method to obtain strictly periodic structures through chain growth aggregation. Among the various methods for synthesizing alternating copolymers, living anionic polymerization can precisely control the mole-cular weight of polymers, with no termination or chain trans-fer during the active chain growth process.34–36 It is difficult to homopolymerize DPE and its derivatives because of steric hin-drance. However, owing to the P–π conjugated structure formed between the two benzene rings and the vinyl group in the monomer, DPE can easily copolymerize with other nonpo-lar olefins. During the process of LAP, the formation of DPE terminal active centers can only lead to alternating cross-growth with comonomers.37,38 Therefore, DPE and various nonpolar olefins can be utilized to synthesize polymers with strictly alternating structures. In this study, four different dienes and a special olefin capable of undergoing a ring-opening reaction were selected for copolymerization with DPE, andfivenewalternatingcopolymersweresuccessfully obtained by adjusting the reaction conditions. All copolymers had carbon–carbon double bonds incorporated into their polymer backbones. After simple hydrogenation treatment, five multiblock structured polymers, namely, pd-DSP, pd-DPP, pd-DES, pd-DSS and pd-DESS, were obtained. By comparing the performance of alternating sequence copolymers and peri-odic sequence copolymers with the 10 different sequence structures mentioned above, the intricate relationship between the polymer structure and performance could be further eluci- dated. Furthermore, the results from this study indicated that LAP could not only yield fully alternating sequence polymers but also indirectly produce polymers with strictly periodic structures. This method provides a new approach for synthe-sizingmultiperiodicstructuredpolymerswithprecise sequences. Consequently, developing strategies for synthesiz-ing precisely periodic polymers is highly challenging and valu-able; this exploration has the potential to enrich the types of periodic sequences and obtain polyolefin materials with better mechanical properties.', 'Results and discussion', 'Polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) are the most widely used general-purpose plastics in the world, and ethylene-co-propylene also has many potential applications. By utilizing a Ziegler–Natta catalyst to catalyze the trans-1,4-polymerization of Ip and hydrogenation, a precise sequence of ethylene-alt-propylene (alt-EP) can be synthesized.39 This type of alternat-ing polymer was obtained through the complex coordination polymerization of a single monomer and severely compro-mised the ability to regulate the carbon skeleton of the poly-mers. Based on the above alt-EP, we introduced other ethylene monomers to copolymerize with Ip to form a fully alternating sequencecopolymer;then,acarbon-richmultiperiodic polymer can be obtained in the same manner after hydrogen-ation. DPE has inherent advantages in the synthesis of alter-nating copolymers by LAP (rD = 0); thus, periodic polymers of DPE–ethylene–propylene (pd-DEP) can be obtained by control-ling the alternation sequence of DPE and Ip. For nonpolar polyolefins, the performance of the copolymer relies more on the arrangement of short branches (methyl) or side groups (phenyl rings) along the main polymer chain when the carbon skeleton structures are similar. Therefore, three types of peri-odic sequences (DPE–propylene–propylene (DPP), DPE–ethyl-ene–ethylene–St (DEES) and DPE–St–St (DSS)) can be obtained by introducing substituted dienes (DMBD, 1-PB, and DPB). The above four types of periodic polymers have a C6 carbon skeleton. Apart from the arrangement of monomer units, the carbon skeleton length affects the properties of polymers. ROMP is an effective method for preparing long carbon skel-etons. Based on this theory, our research group has proposed the AMROP method, which produces a periodic polymer with a C8 backbone structure like DPE–St–ethylene–ethylene (DSEE) (Scheme 1).40', 'The strategy of this study is to obtain strict periodic sequences by using strict alternating polymers; thus, the first step is to regulate DPE and various dienes to form strict alter-nating copolymers. For nonpolar monomers, r1r2 = 0 is a rigid requirement for the synthesis of alternating copolymers; in LAP, the main way of controlling sequences is to alter the reac-tivity ratios of the monomers. The four main pathways are as follows: (1) by adjusting the feeding strategy, the copolymer sequence structure can be changed. Yuki et al. investigated the reaction characteristics of DPE and St in nonpolar solvents during anionic polymerization, and reactivity ratios could be calculated based on the monomer feed ratio and the pro-portion of monomer units in the polymer. (2) The addition of a modifier can effectively promote dynamic propagation and regulate the copolymerization behavior of the monomers. For example, alkoxide metal modifiers can form a special four-mem-bered ring transition state structure with an active center, and the two coexisting counterions can isomerize with each other, thereby altering the rate of crossover propagation. (3) The sol-vation ability and polarity of the solvent directly influence the morphology of the active center, can alter the closeness of the ion pairs and thus affect the reactivity ratios of the monomers. For example, when DPE and Ip are copolymerized in benzene, r2 can reach a maximum of 37, but when they are copolymerized in THF, r2 decreases to 0.11. (4) Temperature affects mainly the reac-tivity ratios of the monomers by affecting the rate constant of crossover propagation. Generally, anionic polymerization occurs at temperatures ranging from −20 °C to 100 °C.41–46 Based on the various regulation methods mentioned above, DPE can be copolymerized with Ip, DMBD, 1-PB, and DPB to obtain strictly alternating polymers. The specific copolymerization process is described in ESI Table S1.†', '@', '@', 'The methyl groups of DMBD serve as electron-donating substituents, not only increasing its steric hindrance but also reducing its reactivity in nucleophilic reactions. As described in Yuki’s report, even if DMBD (M2) and DPE (M1) were copoly-merized in benzene, r2 was only 0.23. For low-reactivity olefins, the polymer structure could be controlled to form alternating sequences by employing a feed strategy. Through the corres-ponding analysis of proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) data (see ESI Fig. S7† and Table 1), the M1/M2 value of DPE and DMBD increased from 1 to 4; this resulted in an increase in the con-version rate of DPE from 69.98% to 88.68% (Covn.M1(%) = Covn.M2(%)/(N2/N1)) and the NDMBD/ND value could reach 1.09 (as calculated via ESI eqn (S7)†). Based on the above results, its structure can be preliminarily identified as an alternating sequence. The obtained polymer had a narrow distribution and a molecular weight close to the predicted value. The con-version rate of DMBD reached 96.66%, indicating that no side reactions occurred during the copolymerization (see Table 1). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) is a direct method for deter-mining the alternating sequence. As shown in Fig. 1(b), using DPE-alt-DMBD as an example, the MALDI-TOF-MS result showed a unique series of proton peaks. The m/z peak at 2967.39 (see ESI Fig. S17†) could be attributed to 10 units of DPE (10 × 180.09 u) + 11 units of DMBD (11 × 68.12 u) + a hydrogen terminal group (1.01 u) + a counterion Ag (106.91 u) + a sec-butyl-terminal group (57.07 u). The difference in the numerical values between each peak consisted of one DPE unit and one DMBD unit.', 'However, for highly active dienes, simply increasing the feeding of DPE not only fails to obtain alternating sequences, but also causes waste of resources. The reactivity ratios of DPE and Ip(M2) are strongly influenced by the solvent, with r2', '@', '@', 'a Mn (SEC) and PDI values for the copolymers were determined using SEC with polystyrene (PS) as a standard. b Ratio of N2/N1 units in the chaincalculated by 1H NMR (N1 represents the number of DPE in the chains and N2 represents the number of dienes in the chains).

Therefore, DPE and IP should be copolymerized in THF (run 1), and their corresponding 1H NMR spectra and MALDI-TOF-MS result are presented in ESI Fig. S6 and S16† (calculated using ESI eqn (S6)†). The polymerization con-ditions of DPE-alt-1-PB and DPE-alt-DPB can be understood by analyzing and comparing the structures of Ip and DMBD, as well as their polymerization conditions. The reaction activity of conjugated dienes is determined by both the conjugation effect and steric hindrance. The 1-position carbon of 1-PB con-tains a phenyl ring substituent, and the presence of this elec-tron-withdrawing group reduces the electron cloud density on the double bond; this is advantageous for the attack of the carbon anions, and therefore, the reactivity of 1-PB is greater than that of Ip. DPB contains two phenyl ring substituents; these substituents reduce the electron cloud density and increase the steric hindrance. Therefore, its reactivity is greater than that of DMBD but lower than that of Ip. Both DPE-alt-1-PB and DPE-alt-DPB can be obtained in THF (runs 5 and 6). The corresponding analyses of the 1H NMR spectra and the MALDI-TOF-MS result are presented in ESI Fig. S8, S9 and S18, S19,† calculated using ESI eqn (S8) and (S9).†', 'The sequence regulation in the copolymers obtained by LAP is controlled by their kinetic behavior. In the preliminary stage, our research group has investigated the copolymeriza-tion reaction characteristics of DPE and CPVB. At room temp-erature, the self-growth kinetic constants of both DPE and CPVB are zero (KCP = 0 and KDD = 0 at 25 °C). Therefore, a new polymerization mechanism, AMROP, is proposed to explain the ideal alternating copolymerization process of CPVB and DPE derivatives. The proposed AMROP provides more possibi-lities for controlling the carbon framework of vinyl monomer polymers; thus, we have shifted our focus to CBVB, which is a styrene derivative with different ring substituents from CPVB. Previously, studies have reported that CBVB can homopolymer-ize through AMROP; its cyclobutyl can be opened and formed into a C5 skeleton polymer by increasing the temperature; the pd-SEE periodic polymer can be obtained after hydrogenation. In the same way, the self-growth kinetic constants of both DPE and CBVB are zero (KCB = 0 and KDD = 0 at 25 °C). Therefore, DPE and CBVB can likely undergo cross-growth at room temp-erature by AMROP and yield a quaternary periodic polymer structure of pd-DSEE. Theoretically, CBVB-alt-DPE can be obtained with a 1 : 1 feed ratio at room temperature. The intra-molecular bond angle of the cyclopropyl three-membered ring in CPVB is 60°, and the hydrogen atoms on the ring are in overlapping positions; these hydrogen atoms can easily create tensionandthereforefacilitatering-openingreactions. However, the intramolecular angle of the cyclobutyl group in CBVB is 90°, resulting in lower ring tension than that of the ternary ring. Therefore, the polymerization reaction rate of DPE and CBVB is slightly lower. With the same design, the conversion rate of CBVB increased from 46% to 84% by extend-ing the polymerization time from 5 days (run 7) to 10 days (run 8), and the molecular weight of the copolymers also doubled. Based on 1H NMR spectrum characterization (ESI Fig. S10†), regardless of whether the conversion rate of CBVB was high or low, the ND/NB value was close to 1; these results confirmed that DPE-alt-CBVB was successfully synthesized. Here, we tested the MALDI-TOF-MS data of low-molecular-weight (run 7) and high-molecular-weight (run 8) polymers, and several series of proton peaks appeared in the spectra. As shown in Fig. 1(e), the peak with an m/z of 2374.28 corresponded to 7 units of DPE (7 × 180.09 u) repeat units +6 units of CBVB (6 × 158.11 u) repeat units + a hydrogen terminal group (1.01 u) + a counterion Ag (106.91 u) + a sec-butyl-terminal group (57.07 u) (ESI Fig. S20†). Similarly, based on the analysis of the data in ESI Fig. S21,† the polymerization time was prolonged, and DPE and CBVB still grew alternately.', 'In conjugated dienes, the mobility of the double bond elec-tron cloud is high, and it is easy to induce polarization. When the density of the π electron cloud on the carbon–carbon doublebonddecreases,theslightlypositivelycharged β-carbon atom is conducive to the attack of the negatively charged anionic active center, causing π-electron heterolysis and initiating anionic polymerization. During the addition reaction of the conjugated dienes with nucleophilic reagents, both 3,4-addition and 1,4-addition can occur. In the case of 1,4-addition, unsaturated double bonds are formed in the polymer skeleton, thereby forming a cis/trans structure. When DPE is copolymerized with Ip, DMBD, 1-PB and DPB, the diole-fins need to be copolymerized with DPE by 1,4-addition to obtain long carbon chain structures. In the polymerization of DPE and Ip, DPE is preferentially triggered by sec-BuLi to form DPE-Li; DPE-Li initially attacks the carbon at the 4-position with less steric hindrance, forming an active center at the carbon at the 1-position with the least steric hindrance. Therefore, the next DPE is added to the carbon at the 1-posi-tion during the alternating copolymerization. As a result, mainly 1,4-structures are formed, with few 3,4-structures pro-duced and almost no formation of a 1,2-structure. Therefore, the 1,2-structures and 3,4-structures were disregarded in the subsequent description of the polymer structure. In the carbonpolymerbackbonestructureoftheDPE-alt-1-PB polymer, 3% 1,2-structures can be clearly observed via 1H NMR (ESI Fig. S8,† δ = 5.7–6.2 (ppm)). However, due to its low content, subsequent discussions are focused only on the 1-PB appearing in the polymer with 1,4-structures. Therefore, the polymer backbones can still ensure the rigor of their periodic structure after hydrogenation. Both DMBD and DPB have sub-stituents at the 2-position carbon and 3-position carbon. DMBD contains two methyl groups, which are electron-donat-ing substituents despite their relatively small steric hindrance. On the other hand, DPB has two phenyl rings as substituents, which are electron-withdrawing groups with significant steric hindrance. Together, these factors caused DMBD and DPB to undergo 1,4-addition to the polymer chain. The1H NMR spectra (ESI Fig. S7 and S9†) also revealed that the unsaturated double bond regions of DPE-alt-DMBD and DPE-alt-DPB had no peaks (δ = 4.0–6.0 (ppm)), showing the absence of a 1,2-structure in the polymer chain. The above results indicated that all five alternating polymers were successfully synthesized according to the proposed structure. A comparison of DPE-alt-Ip and DPE-alt-DMBD revealed that the carbon skeletons of the polymer backbones had the exact same arrangement, but the side chain of DPE-alt-DMBD contained an additional methyl group. When the two polymers had similar molecular weights, the Tg of DPE-alt-DMBD was 16 °C higher. Similarly, DPE-alt-DMBD and DPE-alt-DPB only differed in the size of the side group substitution, and Tg increased by 36 °C. A compari-son of the data revealed that the Tg values of DPE-alt-1-PB and DPE-alt-Ip exhibited unexpected trends. Typically, polymers with a benzene ring as the side group had a greater Tg than those with only a single methyl group. However, in this case, the absence of any substituents on the double bonds in the chain of DPE-alt-1-PB enabled increased bond rotation, result-ing in a Tg for DPE-alt-Ip that was 36 °C higher than expected. Therefore, the thermal properties of nonpolar olefin copoly-mers could be controlled by altering the number of substitu-ents, steric hindrance, and position. The polymer backbones of the five alternating structure polymers all contained double bonds. These double bonds could be used for simple hydro-genation modification to obtain the most basic periodic poly-mers and for more complex substitution and addition reac-tions to produce polymers with different side groups, thus endowing the polymer with a periodic arrangement of the functional groups (Scheme 2).', 'For common nonpolar olefins, controlling the copolymer sequence is often difficult (r1r2 > 0). In our previous work, AMROP was used to develop a new method for regulating the carbon skeleton. After hydrogenation, we successfully obtained strictly periodic polymers of pd-SE, pd-SEM and pd-SEE. Based on the research results, we introduced the special vinyl monomer DPE into the polymer backbone. This not only expanded the carbon skeleton length of the periodic structure and enriched the periodic carbon chain structure, but also increased the richness and feasibility of the design of previous alternating copolymers. The alternating copolymers obtained by LAP in the early stage needed to be hydrogenated to obtain novel periodic polymers. The specific hydrogenation process is described in the ESI.† In this way, five new periodic polymers, pd-DEP, pd-DES, pd-DSEE, pd-DPP and pd-DSS, were obtained.', 'DPE-alt-IP, DPE-alt-1-PB and DPE-alt-CBVB showed signifi-cant changes in the unsaturated region of the 1H NMR spectra before and after hydrogenation because of the double bond of their polymer backbones. Hence, the hydrogenation degree of each hydrogenated product could be directly calculated based on the integral of the hydrogen spectrum (ESI eqn (S13-2), (S14) and (S15)†). The structure of the hydrogenated polymer was characterized by DEPT-135°-13C NMR and 13C NMR (ESI Fig. S13–S15†). The unsaturated carbon peaks of DPE-alt-IP at δ = 130.0–132.0 ppm, DPE-alt-1-PB at δ = 132.0–140.0 ppm and DPE-alt-CBVB at δ = 130.0–137.0 ppm all disappeared; these results further confirmed that the degree of hydrogenation was high. The degree of hydrogenation for the above three struc-tures is shown in Fig. 2. Moreover, it can also explain the acquisition of a strictly periodic structure.', '@', '@', 'However, no change was observed in the unsaturated hydro-gen in the 1H NMR spectra of DPE-alt-DMBD and DPE-alt-DPB before and after hydrogenation. Therefore, the degree of hydro-genation of the polymers could only be analyzed using inverse-gated carbon IG-13C NMR (Fig. 3). Since the NDMBD/NDPE ratio was 1.09, the number of unsaturated seasonal carbons on the DPE structural unit in the polymer chain remained unchanged after hydrogenation (δ = 148.1–148.7 ppm). Using these data as a reference, the degree of hydrogenation could be calculated based on the change in the unsaturated seasonal carbon content of the DMBD structural units. After characterization by IG-13C NMR and the integration of the spectrum, less than 27% of the double bonds in the chain were not hydrogenated. The specific calculations can be found in ESI eqn (S11-1).† The inefficient hydrogenation was caused by the presence of two methyl substituents adjacent to the double bond in the DMBD unit, which affected the hydrogenation efficiency. Similarly, in DPE-alt-DPB, NDPE/NDPB = 1.12. Notably, the number of qua-ternary carbons on the phenyl rings of DPB remained unchanged after hydrogenation in alternating polymer chains (see Fig. 3, δ = 124.5–129.5 ppm). IG-13C NMR was also used to calculate the unsaturation of the polymer chain. Integral calcu-lations revealed that the degree of hydrogenation of the alter-nating copolymer was greater than 87% (ESI equation (S12- 1)†). Furthermore, the degree of hydrogenation could also be determined by analyzing the ratio of unsaturated carbons on the benzene ring using the DPE unit and the DPB unit. (ESI equation (S12-2)†).', 'Therefore, based on the above experimental results, the use of anionic polymerization and simple post-functionalization successfullyproducedaperiodicpolymerwithastrict sequence arrangement. These periodic sequences contained structures such as ethylene and propylene, which were difficult to obtain using traditional aggregation methods. Nonpolar monomers such as ethylene, propylene, and styrene could not be obtained through LAP with controlled molecular weights and narrow distributions. However, the copolymerization of nonpolar monomers could also yield unique and exceptional properties in the resulting rubber. In this study, DPE-alt-IP and DPE-alt-DMBD polymers were successfully functionalized, and copolymer sequences of ethylene and propylene were easily introduced into the polymer chains. The addition of 1-PB and CBVB introduced copolymer sequences of ethylene and styrene. As the polymer sequence changed from an alter-nating structure to a periodic structure, Tg significantly decreasedcomparedwiththatofthenon-hydrogenated polymer. Tg is an important factor that indirectly affects the flexibility of polymer chains. Generally, the independent double bonds in the polymer backbone increase the flexibility of polymer chains and reduce the glass transition temperature. However, all five sets of data in this study revealed that satur-ation of the double bond in the polymer backbone led to a lowerglasstransitiontemperatureofthepolymer(ESI Fig. S22†). This result occurred because the rotation of the carbon–carbon single bond improved the mobility of the polymer chain, which led to a decrease in the glass transition temperature of the polymer (see Scheme 3a and Table 2). Compared with pd-DPP, when the degree of polymerization was similar and when the arrangement density of the methyl substituents in the periodic structure increased (pd-DEP), the friction between the chain ends increased and the Tg of the periodic polymer increased by 26 °C (see Scheme 3b-1).', '@', '@', '@', '@ However, compared with pd-DPP, when the methyl substituent in the periodic structure became a benzene ring, the steric re-sistance between the structural units became greater, resulting in more difficult chain segment movement. Therefore, the Tg of the periodic polymer changed from 117 °C to 133 °C (see Scheme 3b-2). By comparison, pd-DSS and pd-DPP not only had simple periodic arrangement structures but also extended the arrangement of the periodic structure. PDPPDP and SDSSDS are “head–tail” structures. PDPPDP is the equivalent of inserting a second monomer into two propylene monomers. This is a new polymer structure and can be used as a template polymer to provide a reference for the synthesis of more precise positioning sequence polymers. SDSSDS is equivalent to adding a monomer to two styrene monomer units; this structure is difficult to produce using general copolymerization. On compar-ing SDSSDS with the work of Knoll and coworkers from the BASF on “super-polystyrene”,47 it was a pleasant surprise to find that the Tg of DPE-alt-DPB (161 °C) in this work is very close to that of St-alt-DPE in the aforementioned reference; it was also found that the Tg (133 °C) of pd-DSS is very similar to that of the St/DPE copolymer containing 35% DPE in “super-polystyrene”. The com-parison of this data also proves that the relationship between the polymer structure and the thermal properties can be designed and predicted. In addition, the length of the polymer carbon skeleton also affects the thermal performance. pd-DES and pd-DSEE have C6 and C8 skeleton structures, respectively, with the same types of structural units in the polymer backbones. An increase in the length of the periodic sequence enhances the flexibility of the chain, leading to a significant decrease in the Tg (see Scheme 3b-3).', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'a Determined by SEC using PS as a standard. b Glass transition temperature. c The degree of hydrogenation was calculated using ESI eqn (S11-1)–(S11-3), (S12-1), (S12-2), (S13-1), (S13-2), (S14) and (S15).†', 'Conclusion', 'The focus of this study was on the synthesis of periodic poly-mers with precise sequences. Through the synthesis of alter-nating copolymers, periodic polymers with five new structures, including pd-DEP, pd-DES, pd-DSEE, pd-DPP and pd-DSS, were obtained through hydrogenation. In the synthesis of alternat-ing copolymers, DPE-alt-IP, DPE-alt-DMBD, DPE-alt-1-PB and DPE-alt-DPB were used to change the kinetic behavior of the copolymerbyadjustingthepolymerizationtemperature, solvent and feeding ratio through LAP.

After the polymeric backbone was hydrogen-ated and saturated, nonpolar olefins, such as ethylene, propy-lene and styrene, were successfully inserted into the DPE struc-tural unit according to different arrangement combinations; thus, a periodic polymer with a strict arrangement was obtained. When the polymer backbone was saturated, the Tg of the polymer decreased, indicating that the rotation of the carbon–carbon single bond increased the flexibility of the polymer. The Tg values of the polymers with similar periodic arrangements were different; these results indicated that the size of the polymer substituents and the density of the side group arrangement strongly influenced the polymer pro-perties. Furthermore, when the content of substituents was the same, a change in the carbon skeleton length affected the thermal performance of a polymer. Therefore, controlling the length of the periodic sequence, as well as the position, size, and arrangement density of the substituents, could signifi-cantly affect the performance of polymers.', 'Author contributions', 'The manuscript was written by all the authors and each author has contributed to the experiment.

Agyemang,c,d,e Josefine Meurer,a,b Julian Hniopek,Stefan Zechel,a,b Michael Schmitt,c,d Jürgen Popp,c,d,e Martin D. Hageraand Ulrich S. Schubert*a,b,d,f', 'This article presents a versatile method for the preparation of smart interpenetrating polymer networks(IPNs). Based on two different orthogonal binding motives, IPNs are generated by simply mixing ligandcontaining polymers and corresponding metal salts leading to a polymeric material featuring shape-memory abilities. Due to the utilization of heteroleptic complexes as crosslinks in one of the two net-works, simple tuning of the crosslinking density, as well as the generation of IPNs made out of threedifferent main polymers is possible. The structure–property-relationships of the resulting IPNs are investi-gated in a detailed fashion applying FT-Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), dynamic-mechanical-thermal analyses (DMTA) as well as thermo-mechanical analyses (TMA). In the scope ofthermo-mechanical analysis (TMA) excellent shape-memory properties, with strain fixity rates near 100% and strain recovery rates up to 93%, could be observed.', 'Introduction', 'Over many decades, polymers have become an integral part of our daily life. Based on their unique and tunable properties they are used in nearly every application area.1–3 However, the typically applied polymers, which are produced to fulfil a single task over their lifetime, are no longer sufficient. Moreover, we are searching for materials, which are able to adapt their function(s) and properties as a result of experien-cing an environmental change.4 This triggered adaption is beneficial for certain applications and can open completely new fields. For this reason, the research topic dealing with so-called stimuli-responsive polymers has emerged.5–7 One very promising way to obtain such switchable properties in poly-meric materials is the implementation of reversible covalent8or supramolecular crosslinks.9 A variety of such reversible moi-eties have already been successfully used to synthesize switch-able polymers, featuring abilities such as self-healing10 or shape-memory.11', 'Shape-memory polymers (SMPs) have the unique ability to “remember” a predetermined shape.11 After the fabrication of those polymers in their original, so-called permanent shape, it is possible to convert them, under the respective conditions, into a completely new temporary shape. Thereafter, they keep this new shape until an external trigger leads to the induction of the recovery step, in which the “memorized” permanent shape is restored.11,12 The design of SMPs requires, in minimum, two different building units.11,13 Firstly, a trigger-able part, called switching-unit, is important. For this building unit, in general any interaction with a certain degree of reversi-bility can be utilized. Here for example, thermal transitions (e.g., glass transition14 or transition between crystallization and melting15,16) but of course also reversible covalent17,18 or supramolecular bonds19,20 can be mentioned. The other required part is the stable phase. This unit is important for the structural integrity of SMPs and further provides the driving force for the recovery step. It usually consists of covalent21 or physical crosslinks.22 Furthermore, there are also some recent research approaches, in which this part could be generated via an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) structure.23,24', 'Metallopolymers are a special class in the field of polymers, which combine unique properties.25 On the one hand, they have all the advantages of polymers, such as cheap and easy production, low weight, corrosion-resistance and many more.1But at the same time, the integrated metal-complex, whose binding strength and properties can be easily adjusted by the choice of ligand and/or metal salt(s), provides an ideal oppor-tunity for the design of switchable and intelligent materials.26There are numerous reports in literature that deal with metal-lopolymers for a wide variety of stimuli responsive materials for several application fields, e.g., as sensors,27 for drug-deliv-ery28 or self-healing.29,30', 'In order to fabricate smart materials, which are addressable withmultiplestimuliand/orshowmultipleresponses, different dynamic binding motifs, which are orthogonal, need to be integrated.31 This orthogonality can be obtained by the utilization of completely different binding concepts, like, e.g., hydrogen bonds in combination with metal–ligand inter-actions.32 Even though the benefits of metallopolymers, metal–ligand interactions are more likely to interfere with each other, resulting in a lack of orthogonality, which is why such systems solely based on metal complexes are rather limited in literature. Nevertheless, our group already presented a few examples in which SMPs could be generated entirely based on metallopolymersfeaturingexcellentshape-memory abilities.33–35 In this context, two metal complexes of different stability formed the basis for both required structural units. In one of those studies the two complexes, namely a bis-terpyri-dine and a tris- or bis-trityl-histidine complex, could be uti-lized to achieve an IPN structure in a very simple manner.35Thus, this study will be the starting point for the current inves-tigation in which a better tunability of the polymeric structure of the IPN should be obtained by applying heteroleptic metal complexes for the first time. This introduction leads to the possibility to tune one phase of the IPN individually without influence the other part of the polymer.', 'The first network is generated via the formation of a homo-leptic complexes (bis-terpyridine). On the other hand, the second network is crosslinked via the formation of heteroleptic complexes(formedbetweenzinc-tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnTPP) and pyridine (Py)). In this way it is also possible to selectively influence the crosslinking density in the second network. Furthermore, this novel synthetic approach opens the way to include multiple polymers in a single subnetwork (via heteroleptic complexes) of the resulting IPNs broadening the chemistry of IPNs in general.', 'Results and discussion', 'Supramolecular binding motifs', 'The orthogonality of the two utilized metal complexes is the key parameter for the formation of the desired interpenetrat-ing polymer network structure. Furthermore, the utilized metal complexes should be addressable to obtain smart pro-perties in the resulting materials and feature a different stabi- lity in order to represent both required building units for shape-memory polymers. In one of our former studies we uti-lized a stable bis-terpyridine complex to crosslink one, and a much weaker trityl-histidine based complex, for the formation of the second polymer network.35 These two binding motifs were found to be fully orthogonal in the solid state, in particu-lar for the here used combination of iron and zinc ions.', 'The stable bis-terpyridine complex was also selected in this study to obtain a network acting as stable phase during the shape-memory process.', 'The weaker complex, crosslinking the second network and acting as switching unit in the SMPs, was exchanged this time by a heteroleptic binding motif, enabling a better and easier tunability of the IPN composition. In this context, the ZnTPP-Py interaction represents an excellent candidate due to its labile nature and resistance against competing terpyridine (Tpy) ligands. This orthogonality is well-known in literature and derived from steric constraints.36,37 While the ZnTPP pro-vides only one free axial binding site, the multidentate Tpy is not able to coordinate the zinc core. In a previous study we investigated this behavior in a detailed fashion using isother-mal titration calorimetry (ITC) and were able to show that the intrinsic orthogonality remains if the binding motifs are implemented in a polymeric environment.38,39', 'Ligand containing polymers', 'Initially ligand containing monomers, namely 6-(2,2′:6′2″-terpyri-din-4′-yloxy)-hexyl methacrylate (Tpy-MA) as well as N-(4-(10,15,20-triphenylporphyrin-5-yl)phenyl) methacrylamide (TPP-MA), were synthesized. While Tpy-MA was prepared according to a literature procedure,29 TPP-MA was obtained by the treatment of 4-(10,15,20-triphenylporphyrin-5-yl)aniline with methacrylic anhy-dride.

The synthesis of all polymers is presented in Scheme 1. 2,2′-Azo-bis(2-methylpropionitrile) (AIBN) was uti-lized as initiator for all polymerizations. As chain transfer agent (CTA) either 2-cyano-2-propyl dodecyl trithiocarbonate (CPDT) (P2) or 2-cyano-2-propyl benzodithioate (CPDB) (P1 and P3) was selected. For the synthesis of P1, Tpy-MA was copolymerizedwithbutylmethacrylate(BMA)asmain monomer. The polymer P2 was prepared by copolymerization of the formerly synthesized TPP-MA with 2-ethylhexyl meth-acrylate (2-EHMA). Metalation of the porphyrin moieties with zinc(II) acetate lead to the polymer P2-Zn. The quantitative metalation of all porphyrin side groups was verified by the comparison of the respective NMR spectra (Fig. S3†).38 Due to the loss of the NH-protons, the respective signal at negative ppm-values completely disappeared in the spectrum of P2-Zn. 2-EHMA was also utilized as main monomer for the synthesis of P3a to P3c, together with 4-vinyl pyridine (4-VPy) as com-mercially available ligand monomer. Furthermore, in contrast to P1 and P2, the ligand monomer content was varied for the three different polymerizations (increasing 4-VPy content from P3a to P3c), to enable a simple tuning of the crosslinking density in the network two later on. Additionally, the polymer P3d was synthesized via the copolymerization of styrene and 4-VPy with the same ligand content obtained in P3c. A detailed description of all polymerizations and the metalation of P2 is presented in the ESI (Table S1†). The molar masses as well as dispersities of the synthesized polymers were determined via size exclusion chromatography (SEC). All polymers revealed a unimodal molar mass distribution with low dispersities, which is characteristic for controlled radical polymerization techniques like RAFT.40 The determined molar masses of the linear polymers are rather comparable, ranging from Mn-', '@', '@ values of 12 500 g mol−1 (P1) to 15 400 g mol−1 (P3b). The only exception was found for P3d which only revealed a Mn of 8100 g mol−1. For this polymerization styrene was utilized as comonomer, which is known to yield in lower monomer con-versions when utilizing RAFT.41 A decrease in molar mass could be observed for P2-Zn when compared to the non-meta-lated polymer P2, which indicates a decrease of the hydrodyn-amic radius. This might result from intramolecular inter-actions between the metalated side-chain moieties leading to a varied hydrodynamic behavior after complexation. The1H NMR spectra were used to calculate the exact composition of the final polymers. In particular for P3a to P3d the ligand content played an important role, since one goal of this study was to investigate the influence of the crosslinking density of the switchable polymer network on the shape-memory abilities of the resulting IPNs. It was found that the resulting polymer compositions nearly match the ratio of main monomer to ligand monomer which was utilized for the synthesis. The results of the SEC investigations as well as the determined compositions are listed in Table 1.

As mentioned before, those IPNs should be based on two different networks. Network one, which should be formed from P1 in the presence of iron sulfate, is thereby crosslinked via stable bis-terpyridine-iron(II)-complexes, and network two is formed through the formation of the heteroleptic complexes between P2-Zn and the pyridine side chains of P3a to P3d. A schematic representation of the synthesis of the different IPNs is presented in Fig. 1. A detailed description is provided in the ESI (Table S2†).', 'For all IPNs, an equimolar ratio of [Tpy-ligand] to [TPP-ligand] to [Py-ligand] was utilized, which was calculated based on the composition, determined in the1H NMR spectra. Firstly, two separate mixtures were prepared. Mixture one con-tained P2-Zn (dissolved in chloroform) and the required amount of iron(II) sulfate (dissolved in a small amount of methanol). For the other mixture, the required amounts of P1 and P3 were dissolved in chloroform. Subsequently, mixture two was given to mixture one leading to the formation of the interpenetrating networks based on the orthogonality of both supramolecular binding motifs. This procedure was performed analogously for all different pyridine containing polymers (P3a to P3d), resulting in four different IPNs (IPN-a to IPN-d). While the IPNs-a–c should feature a different crosslinking density, regarding network two, IPN-c and -d only differ in the main monomer of P3. Furthermore, four different model metallopo-lymer networks were prepared. MP-1 was synthesized as refer-ence sample for the stable phase based on P1 by the addition of FeSO4.', 'Furthermore,threedifferentmetallopolymerswere synthesized as reference sample for the labile networks, cross-linked via ZnTPP-Py interactions. Those networks (MP-2a, MP-2c and MP-2d) were prepared by mixing P2-Zn with P3a (EHMA-based with the lowest pyridine content), P3c (EHMA-based with the highest pyridine content), as well as P3d (styrene-based pyridine polymer). The general pro-cedure and the exact amounts are provided in the ESI (Table S3†). In general, the model metallopolymers enable a detailed interpretation of the investigations of the structurally complexIPNs(Ramanspectraormechanicalanalyses) later on.', 'Raman spectroscopic investigations', 'To validate the formation of the interpenetrating networks based on the orthogonality of both supramolecular binding motifs, Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed on the interpenetrating networks IPN-a to IPN-d, the polymers P1 to P3, as well as the model samples MP-1 to MP-2. Raman spectroscopy offers insights into ligand binding, complexation, and structural changes, consequently representing an effective tool for studying the selective formation of orthogonal metal complexes.33,35', 'Characteristic vibrational bands for the binding of vinyl pyr-idine to the porphyrin complex were first identified by investi-gating the model complexes ZnTPP and ZnTPP-Py (Fig. S36†). Here, characteristic shifts of bands in three regions of interest could be identified, which can be used to confirm the binding of Py to the ZnTPP complex. Namely, the band doublet at 390/ 410 cm−1, which can be assigned to νZn–N vibrations,42,43 is further split with the band at 390 cm−1 being redshifted by ca. 8 cm−1 and the band at 410 cm−1 being blueshifted by ca. 5 cm−1. This is caused by the additional electron density donated by the pyridine ligand into the metal orbitals. A further characteristic shift can be identified for the band at 1083 cm−1, which can be assigned to νC–H vibrations of the pyrrole subunits in the porphyrin ligand.42 Here, a redshift of ca. 5 cm−1 is observable. Further redshifts, also attributed to the porphyrin centered modes, can be observed for the bands at 1365 (in-plane skeletal mode of pyrrole unit; −3 cm−1), 1462 (νC–C, bridge; −8 cm−1) and 1496 cm−1 (νC–C, pyrrole; −2 cm−1).42 All of these shifts are caused by partial population of π* orbitals due to the coordination of the axial pyridine, which is an effect well known from literature and weakens the associatedbonds,thusredshiftingthevibrational frequencies.44,45 To confirm that, these changes are also visible in a polymeric environment, model complexes MP2-a to MP2-c were also measured (Fig. S36,† top lines). A polymeric', '@', '@', 'a Eluent: CHCl3/NEt3/i-PrOH [94 : 4 : 2], PMMA standard (P1, P2, P2-Zn and P3a to P3c) or PS standard (P3d) b 300 MHz, CD2Cl2.', '@', '@ environment is known to cause band broadenings, to influ-ence the positions of some bands slightly and of course intro-duces additional, potentially overlapping bands.33 Due to this, only the band shifts for the νZn–N vibration at 390 cm−1 and the νC–C vibration at 1462 cm−1 are visible here. Nevertheless, these shifts are still characteristic enough to allow a clear identification of the formed ZnTPP-Py complex.', 'With these characteristic bands in mind, in a next step IPN-a to IPN-d were studied in the same manner. Due to the additional presence of Tpy ligands, introduced by P1, the band at 1462 cm−1 could not be used for the identification of the pyridine complex, as a strong Tpy band overlaps here. Notwithstanding this, the νZn–N band, which is nicely separ-ated from overlapping bands can be used to clearly prove the formation of the desired ZnTPP-Py complexes within the IPNs.', 'Fig. 2 depicts the Raman spectra of P2-Zn (as a comparison) and the IPNs in the region of interest. For all IPNs clear redshifts of 2.7 to 4.5 cm−1 can be identified, which, keeping in mind the spectral precision of <0.5 cm−1 of the used Raman device, clearly proves the presence of the pyridine complexes.', '@', '@', 'Furthermore, utilizing the same FT-Raman study, the for-mation of the bis-terpyridine-iron(II)-complexes inside the IPNs could be confirmed. The effect of the formation of this complex on the Tpy vibrations has been extensively described in previous studies. Thereby in general, a shift of the strong band located at 996 cm−1 (δC–C) to higher wavenumbers can by observed and cis–trans transition and shortening of the C–C bonds induces more complex changes of the region between 1540 and 1620 cm−1 (νC–C/N).33–35 While the changes in the higher wavenumber region cannot be easily observed for these IPNs, as there is a large amount of overlap with signals from P2-Zn and P3, the characteristic blueshift of the band at 996 cm−1 could be observed for all IPNs (Fig. S37†) proving the formation of both the stabile and labile complex required for their function. Furthermore, no significant uncoordinated ligand fractions could be detected. Therefore, the complex for-mation can be regarded as virtually quantitative.', 'Regarding the implementation of several dynamic metal-complexes inside the prepared IPNs, a potential interference or metal exchange upon thermal cycling needs to be excluded. Raman spectroscopy represents a powerful method in this context, since it provides insights on the molecular level, i.e. the nature of the reversible binding motifs.', 'To examine the long-term stability of the binding motifs under thermal stress, a long-term Raman spectroscopic experi- ment was performed. For this purpose, IPN-c was treated at a reasonableoperatingtemperaturefortheshape-memory process of 80 °C for in total 19 days. The sample was allowed to cool to room temperature every day and a Raman spectrum was recorded (Fig. S55†). In this context, any changes in complex formation during thermal cycling should be visible in significant band shifts over time. The band location of the νZn–N vibration at approx. 390 cm−1, which is characteristic for the ZnTPP-Py complex, was determined for every measure-ment (Fig. S56†). It can be seen from Table S9† that the band location continuously variates between 386.0 and 387.9 cm−1and does not follow an observable trend over time. Thus, it can be concluded that the ZnTPP-Py binding motif is present after every thermal cycle as intended and no thermal induced cross-interactions with the present tpy complex, such as poten-tial transmetalation, occurs.', 'Thermal properties', 'A very important parameter for thermally triggered polymers is their thermal behavior. For this reason, firstly the degradation temperature (Td) of all building block polymers and IPNs was determined applying thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). The investigation of the thermal stability is important to ensure that no degradation of the samples occurs during the manu-facturing steps or the thermally triggered switching. The TGA measurements revealed for all polymers and IPNs a Td above 200 °C. Additionally, within temperature dependent dynamic-mechanical analysis (DMTA), the mechanical properties of the four IPNs as well as those of the reference metallopolymers (MP-2a, MP-2c and MP-2d) were investigated.', 'A plot of those measurements, showing the corresponding loss factors (tan(δ)) depending on the temperature, is pre-sented in Fig. 3. Interestingly, the resulting curve of tan(δ) revealed two maxima for the model polymers MP-2a and MP-2c. One is located at moderate temperatures of 50 to 70 °C and one at higher temperatures around 100 °C.', '@', '@', 'Our assumption is that the lower one results from the glass transition temperature of the polymer chains, while the second one indicates the activation (induced mobility due to partialdecomplexationand/orligandexchange)ofthe ZnTPP-Py complex. By comparing MP-2a with MP-2c, which only differ regarding their crosslinking density, different inten-sities for the two signals are visible. For MP-2c, the model polymer with the highest crosslinking density, the signal at higher temperature is dominant, while the other one is nearly invisible and looks more like a shoulder. In the case of MP-2a, there is a clear peak at around 50 °C and a similarly large elevation later in the curve at around 100 °C. In our opinion, the different trend of the curves can be explained very well by the composition of MP-2a.', 'By combining the results of SEC and the calculated monomer ratio in P3a, it becomes clear that on average the polymer chains carry only 1 to 2 pyridine moieties per chain. However, these polymer chains are unable to form a network structure with P2-Zn, but only cause a supramolecular chain extension at the ZnTPP moieties of P2-Zn, leading to a graft polymer-likearchitecture.Thisdifferentstructurecould explain the strong visibility of the glass transition related signal at moderate temperatures in the case of MP-2a and its “missing” for the sample MP-2c, featuring a relatively high supramolecularcrosslinkingdensity.Furthermore,the maxima are shifted towards higher temperature with increas-ing crosslinking density, which is expected for the glass tran-sition of higher crosslinked networks.', 'The fact that also the second maximum is shifted in the same direction indicates that not only the nature of the revers-ible bond but also the overall content influences the tan(δ) maximum. This behavior can be explained by the thermal acti-vation mechanism of the supramolecular crosslinks in the net-works. With a temperature dependent shift of the equilibrium between stable and activated complexes, a progressive decrease in crosslinking density is expected upon heating. The system will show a maximum in tan(δ) when the loss modulus domi-nates the storage modulus at a certain degree of crosslinking. Samples with a higher initial crosslinking density will reach this point at higher temperatures, assuming the same relative activation state and temperature dependent equilibrium.', 'The two signals are also observable for the corresponding IPNs with the same observable trends. However, there is a clear temperature shift of those signals compared to the model systems, which is probably caused by the additional network in these samples, as it has also been shown for other IPNs in the literature.46 Interestingly, in the case of MP-2d no maximum of tan(δ) could be identified, while for the corres-ponding IPN three maxima are observable.', 'In addition to the two processes above, the third at higher temperature (150 °C) might be induced by the additional poly-styrene backbone and/or the more stable bis-Tpy crosslinks.', 'Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) represents another method to measure thermal transitions within the polymers and IPNs. For P1 a Tg of 18 °C could be determined, while P3d revealed Tg of 104 °C. These glass transition temperatures are within the expected range based on the utilized main mono-mers BMA and styrene.47,48 In contrast no Tg was observable for all linear polymers containing EHMA. For the methacry-late-based IPNs (IPN-a and IPN-b) an increase of the glass tran-sition (from 30 to 44 °C) could be found within an increase of thecrosslinkingdensityoftheswitchingphase. Simultaneously, an increase in crosslinking density seems to fade out any visible glass transition within the DSC curves. While the curves are in general difficult to evaluate (Tg of IPNa needed to be evaluated from the second heating cycle) IPN-c and IPN-d showed no observable Tg, at all. In contrast, DMTA revealed tan(δ) maxima in all cases. The respective DSC traces may indicate a thermal transition, which however feature a too low intensity to be evaluated properly. In this context the tan (δ) method can be regarded as a more sensitive method and provides better insight in temperature dependent processes.', 'All TGA, DSC and DMTA plots as well as a summary of the detected temperatures during those measurements are pre-sented in the ESI (see Fig. S8–S29 and Tables S4–S6†).', 'Shape-memory ability', 'The investigation of shape-memory abilities requires an initial processing step to predetermine the permanent shape of the IPNs. This step was performed analogously to literature procedures,33–35 leading to rectangular polymer specimen (see photo in Fig. 4a) which represent a suitable form for manual tests as well as thermo-mechanical analyses. Subsequently, within manual tests the general ability of the IPNs to reveal a shape-memory effect was investigated. During those manual tests (Fig. S35†) it was already observable that the shape-memory abilities of the IPNs strongly depend on the pyridine content of P3. IPN-a, which was prepared using P3a (2% Py) stayed in the temporary shape even though the recovery step was triggered, while IPN-c, which contained P3c (10% Py), showed a full restorage of the original form within a few seconds. Exemplarily, a photo-series of the manual test for the sample IPN-c is displayed in Fig. 4a.', 'In order to quantify the shape-memory abilities of all IPNs, thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA) followed the manual test. Within these measurements, it is possible to calculate the strain fixity (Rf) and strain recovery rates (Rr) according to eqn (1) and (2), which indicate the quality of the fixation of the temporary form as well as the recovery step to the original form. The calculations are based on shear strain percentages (γ), which are recorded during the TMA. The permanent shape (γA) serves as reference point for the measurement and is con-sequently 0%.', 'Rf ¼ γB=γB;prog: �100%', 'Rr ¼ ðγB;prog: – γA;rec:Þ=ðγB;prog: – γAÞ �100%', 'For the temporary shape two different values are defined. γB, prog. represents the shear strain after applying torsional stress at the switching temperature, while γB stands for the shear strain after fixation (cooling) and release of the shear stress. Finally, γA, rec. reveals the remaining shear strain in the specimen after the recovery step. For each IPN four consecutive cycles were recorded without reprocessing the samples in between. In each case a significantly lower recovery rate could be determined in the first cycle, while Rr is slightly increasing through the cycles.', '@', '@', 'This behavior is well-known in literature for SMPs and can be ascribed to remaining residual stress as well as thermal history of the specimen.49 Furthermore, this observation pro-vides strong evidence for the stability and absence of cross-interactions between the utilized binding motifs in addition to the spectroscopic findings. A potential metal-exchange would resultinshiftedbindingaffinities,and,consequently, decreased shape-memory performance due to unintended acti-vation of the stable phase. Such behavior cannot be observed during thermal cycling. This obtained result is also in line with previous measurements in solution, which revealed a selective formation of ZnTPP-Py and bis-terpyridine systems simultaneously.38', 'Exemplarily, the resulting 3D-TMA plot of the second cycle for IPN-c is presented in Fig. 4a. Furthermore, all calculated recovery rates are presented and compared in Fig. 4b. Further information as well as all TMA plots are presented in the ESI (Table S7 and Fig. S29–S33†). While every tested sample showed excellent fixity rates (near 100%), the TMA measure-ments confirmed the assumption, already made in the manual test. A clear structure–property-relationship, relating recovery and crosslinking density, is visible. The poor shape-memory abilities of IPN-a can easily be explained by its overall composition.', 'As mentioned before, P3a is not able to really form the second network with P2-Zn, due to the low Py-content. For this reason, IPN-a should not be able to form an interpenetrating polymer network structure. Instead, a semi-IPN in which a network of P1 and the iron(II)-ions is formed, which is inter-spersed with supramolecular connected graft polymer chains out of P3a and P2-Zn. The fact that this semi-IPN has extre-mely poor shape-memory properties provides evidence that the IPN structure, based on the supramolecular bonding, is essen-tial for the shape-memory effect. Besides that, an increasing crosslinkingdensityoftheswitchingphase(ZnTPP-Py network) appears to be beneficial for the shape-memory process. IPN-b (5% Py) still reveals good recovery rates up to 87% while excellent values could be obtained for IPN-c (10% Py, Rr = 93%). Presumably a higher crosslinking density is cau-sative for a larger difference in flexibility of the switching unit between the fixed and activated (dynamic) state, which influ-ences the shape-memory behavior.', 'Furthermore, the crosslinking density also affects the optimal switching temperature, since more thermal energy is required to obtain flexibility in the specimen. Since in all of the upper IPNs the switching phase is solely build up by EHMA-based copolymers (EHMA is known to induce a rela-tively low glass transition),47 the required switching tempera-tures may be predominantly effected by the nature and content of the labile ZnTPP-Py complexes.', 'In the case of IPN-d, the additional styrene backbone of P3-d provides a higher Tg. Hence, the thermal properties of the switching phase are presumably determined by an interplay between this glass transition and the metal–ligand crosslinks, resulting in an increased optimal switching temperature of 90 °C, even though the crosslinking density is identical to IPN-c. Thus, the implementation of a mixed network as switching phase (enabled by the utilization of a heteroleptic binding motif) offers the possibility to further adjust the usable switch-ing temperatures.', 'Rewriting potential', 'Since the presented IPNs are based on two orthogonal metal ligand interactions, the materials feature additional smart pro-perties beside single one-way shape-memory behavior. The bis-terpyridine-iron(II)-complexes(crosslinksofthestable network/phase) remain stable during the upper TMA cycles, but can still be activated at even higher temperatures. Under these circumstances the material should exhibit a vitrimer-like behavior enabling a complete reprocessing of the samples as well as the possibility to rewrite the permanent shape.', 'In order to investigate this, the sample of IPN-c (utilized for TMA) was grinded manually into granules. Subsequently, the material was hot-pressed again (see ESI†) into a rectangular specimen under identical conditions, which was further inves-tigated by TMA (sample IPN-c*). An initial TMA cycle was per-formed to erase remaining residual stress and thermal history resulting from the reprocessing step. The following second cycle is displayed in Fig. 5. IPN-c* revealed still a very good Rf close to 100% as well as a Rr of 86%, which represents only a slight decrease compared to the value obtained from the second TMA cycle of IPN-c (90%). These findings clearly demonstrate a reprocessability of the sample without a signifi-cant loss of shape-memory properties.', 'After thermo-mechanical characterization, the specimen was heated to 110 °C, which leads again to an activation (induced mobility due to partial decomplexation and/or ligand exchange) of the more stable Tpy complexes, enabling a per-manent deformation and, thus, a rewriting of the permanent shape. This was realized by twisting in opposite direction until a torsional shear strain of −25% was reached (Fig. 5, γA, rewr.).', 'The efficiency of this reprogramming step (Effrewr.) can be determined as the fixity of the rewritten permanent shape, cal-culated according to eqn (3), where γA,rec. represents the remaining shear strain of the preceding TMA cycle. γA2, rewr. displays the defined negative torsion (−25%) and γA2 the remaining shear strain after fixation (cooling).', 'Effrewr: ¼ ðγA;rec: – γA2Þ=ðγA;rec: – γA2;rewr:Þ �100%', 'The rewriting process of IPN-c* was found to be highly efficient (Effrewr. = 98%). In order to examine the ability of the sample to recover the new permanent shape, an additional TMA cycle was recorded (Fig. 5, t > 7500 s). The procedure of this measurement is identical to the previous TMA, just utiliz-ing the rewritten shape (γA2) as reference point. It is clearly visible that the observed recovery step exceeds the initial per- manent form (γA = 0%) and the rewritten permanent shape is restored. A Rr of 78% could be determined, which appears to be low at first glance. Keeping in mind that the performed measurement represents an initial TMA cycle after processing, the value needs to be compared with Rr of IPN-c, which was obtained in the first TMA cycle (84%). In this context, also only a slight decline in shape-memory ability is observable.', '@', '@', 'The results indicate that rewriting of the permanent shape based on the more stable Tpy complexes is feasible and does not negatively influence the shape-memory properties in a drastic manner.', 'Experimental part', 'Materials and methods', 'All chemicals were used as received from TCI (Eschborn, Germany), Sigma Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany), Alfa Aesar (Kandel, Germany), Thermo Fisher Scientific (Geel, Belgium) and Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium) if not otherwise stated.

By simply mixing those polymers together with iron sulfate, interpenetrating metallo-polymer networks were obtained due to the orthogonality of the two different complexes. The desired complex formation was proven via FT-Raman spectroscopy. The structure–prop- erty-relationships of all samples were investigated in a detailed fashion by thermogravimetric analysis as well as thermo-mechanical investigations. In particular, the thermo-mechani-cal analysis revealed a strong correlation of the shape-memory abilities and the overall composition of the IPNs. These material properties, in combination with spectroscopic data and previous investigations in solution,38 strongly indicate the remaining orthogonality of the applied binding motifs during the shape-memory process.', 'The results also clearly exhibit that the crosslinking density of the switchable polymer networks is crucial for shape memory capabilities and can easily be tuned by the incorpor-ation of a heteroleptic metal-complex. Moreover, this structural feature enables the fabrication of IPNs, incorporating three different polymers at the same time, in our case: BMA, 2-EHMA and styrene. In this context it was possible to include multiple polymers in a single phase of the resulting shape-memory materials.Furthermore,theincorporationoforthogonal addressable metal-complexes as a structural feature enables the fabrication of IPNs which are fully recyclable and rewritable.', 'Author contributions', 'Synthesis: T.

Detailed kinetic experiments were conducted to monitor the homo- andcopolymerization of ε-CL with 7-(prop-2-ynyl)oxepan-2-one. By analyzing the kinetic data, we calcu-lated the copolymerization parameters and mapped the composition profile of the resulting copolymers. The resulting gradient copolymers exhibited a lightly tapered composition profile, with an increase in ε-CL consumption at higher conversions where the more reactive 7-(prop-2-ynyl)oxepan-2-one is almostdepleted. These findings were further validated through quantum chemical calculations, providing insights into the precise structure and composition of the copolymers. Characterization of the self-assemblednanoparticles was performed using static and dynamic light scattering, and their morphology was visual-ized via conventional and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, confirming the formation of small, homogeneous spherical micelles. To demonstrate their potential in drug delivery, we combined a modeldrug consisting of a phenylboronic acid-conjugated metallacarborane cluster with diblock copolymer,utilizing reversible bonding between diols and phenylboronic acid and investigated the impact of drug loading on nanoparticle properties. Our comprehensive study underscores the importance of precise syn-thesis and structural prediction in the development of biodegradable diblock copolymers, offering valu-able insights into their synthesis, kinetic behavior, and nanoscale assembly for advanced drug delivery applications.', 'Introduction', 'Amphiphilic block copolymers are versatile materials compris-ing two or more chemically distinct and typically immiscible covalently bonded blocks. By changing these blocks or their order, length, or incompatibility, the material properties can be easily tuned for specific applications. Such a convenient adjustability has prompted their use in diverse fields including tissue engineering, cell encapsulation, gene therapy and drug delivery.1,2 Many drug polymeric delivery systems (DDSs) have been produced with poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and its copoly-mers due to their relative affordability, high permeability to numerous drugs, excellent biocompatibility, and ability to be fully excreted from the body once bioresorbed.3–5 Well-defined PCLs with narrow molar mass distributions are formed by ε-CL ring-opening polymerization (ROP) routinely catalyzed by FDA-approved tin(II) ethylhexanoate (stannous octoate, SnOct2),6–9 using an mPEG macroinitiator in order to obtain blockcopolymers.Inthisregard,mPEG-b-PCL-based nanoDDSs with a high encapsulation efficiency (EE) have been prepared for various active compounds (177–1269 g mol−1, X log P3 −9.9 to 7.5)10,11 including poorly soluble sulforaphane and paclitaxel. The loading content of the latter increases with the length of the hydrophobic PCL block.12', 'Considerable research efforts have been made to modify synthetic polyesters to tackle their main limitations, namely inherent hydrophobicity and lack of chemical functionalities between the backbone ester groups.13 The solution is the modification of the polyester backbone with adequate func-tional groups that can be attached via polymerization of pre-functionalizedmonomers,14–17post-polymerization modifications18–20 or the combination of both methods.21–25Combined synthetic pathways are based on functionalized monomers that are suitable for subsequent click reactions, such as thiol–ene or thiol–yne click reactions.26–29 One of the appropriate monomers for the thiol–yne click reaction is pro-pargyl substituted ε-caprolactone (PgCL). This monomer is typically produced as an isomeric mixture of 3- and 7-(prop-2-ynyl)oxepan-2-ones (3- and 7-isomers) containing 30% of the 3-isomer and it has been widely used in biomedical appli-cations of the respective (co)polymers.29–36', 'In cancer therapy, conventional low-molecular therapeutics exhibit unfavorable pharmacokinetics, suboptimal biodistribu-tion, short blood half-life and prominent off-target, resulting in severe side effects. In comparison, nanoparticle formu-lations of the desired size (over 40 kDa to exceed the renal clearance threshold) show reduced kidney excretion and there-fore prolonged circulation half-life. The half-life can be further improved by coating the nanoparticles with stealth polymers. Notably, poly(ethylene glycol) coatings are extensively used to prevent aggregation and opsonization with plasma proteins.37Several types of boron-containing compounds are frequently considered for cancer treatment, such as boronic acids and boron clusters.38 Boronic acids (BAs) are inherently electron-deficient organoboron compounds due to a vacant p-orbital on the boron atom. In aqueous media, hydroxyl groups act as Lewis bases interconverting the sp2-hybridized form of BAs to a tetrahedral sp3 hydroxyboronate anion in a pH-dependent equilibrium. Although both forms bind to 1,2- and 1,3-diols, boronate esters formed by the latter are more hydrolytically stable.39 Despite being highly reactive, BAs show remarkable stability and a very low toxicology profile.40 Owing to these pro-perties, BAs are employed as stimuli-responsive groups, as tar-geting ligands, and as therapeutics. In BA-containing materials for drug delivery, not only pH but also reactive oxygen species (ROS) and diols such as sugars and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) can be used as release triggers.41–43', 'Boron clusters are polyhedral boron hydrides whose high boron content makes them suitable for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT).38 Upon irradiation with thermal neutrons, boron-10 atoms yield recoiling lithium-7 nuclei and alpha par-ticles which destroy biologically active molecules, such as DNA, RNA, and proteins. The short path of these particles (approxi- mately one cell in diameter – 10–14 μm) and the weak hydrogen and nitrogen capture cross-section limit damage to normal tissue.44 Nevertheless, delivering boronated compounds to a tumor while avoiding significant uptake in normal tissues and adsorption to plasma proteins remains a challenge.45 A promis-ing strategy for overcoming these drawbacks is integrating boron clusters with polymeric delivery systems.38', 'Thus, we prepared several diblock copolymers mPEG-b-P(ε-CL-co-PgCL) bearing propargyl pendant groups. The sub-sequent modification of reactive triple bonds via a thiol–yne click reaction with 1-thioglycerol yielded copolymers bearing vicinal diols, which can reversibly bind to boronic acid deriva-tives. Additionally, we studied the kinetic profile of ε-CL/PgCL copolymerization and characterized the self-assembled nano-particles by static and dynamic light scattering. The formation of small, homogeneous spherical micelles was visualized using conventional (negatively stained samples) and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy.

This behavior is in line with the previously published data, describing that longer PCL chains are more inclinable to undergo UV degradation.46 However, all diblock copolymers modified with 1-thioglycerol (Table 2) exhibited the same degree of substitution as the starting copolymers (Table 1). Moreover, no double bonds were detected in the 1H NMR spectra (B, Fig. 1). This indicates that each alkyne functional group was reacted with two thiol species, generating a dithioether.

This set of experimental data was pro-cessed with the Integrated Ideal Model (A, Fig. 3). The Integrated Ideal Model was developed by Frey et al.49 and it is derived from Wall’s non-terminal (“ideal”) model,50 describ-ing the ideal copolymerization (r1·r2 = 1). The calculated copolymerization parameters of the ε-CL and 7-isomer couple obtained from the Integrated Ideal Model (rε-CL = 0.36; r7-is = 2.79) confirmed the higher reactivity of the 7-isomer (A, Fig. 3).', 'The same data set (total conversion vs. monomer feed com-position) was also evaluated with the more complex terminal model originally proposed by Mayo and Lewis.51 The differen-tial Mayo–Lewis equation was combined with the Skeist relation52 and converted to the integrated model by Meyer and Lowry.53 The Meyer–Lowry model (Fig. S3†) provided similar copolymerization parameters (rε-CL = 0.28; r7-is = 2.05) to the Integrated Ideal Model (rε-CL = 0.36; r7-is = 2.79, Fig. 3A) without a significant change in the fit quality. Overall, the Integrated Ideal Model can sufficiently describe the experi-mental data, which clearly indicates the ideal copolymeriza-tion of ε-CL with the 7-isomer. The similar copolymerization behavior has been already studied for different monomer systems.49,54,55', 'Copolymerization parameters obtained from the Integrated Ideal Model49 enabled the calculation and further precise display of structural composition along the polymer chain by applying the Skeist model (Table S2† and Fig. 3B).52 The result-ing gradient copolymer showed a lightly tapered composition profile with an increase of the ε-CL consumption at higher conversions where the more reactive 7-isomer is almost ener-vated (B, Fig. 3).

By analogy with our previous paper,55 the studied system consisted of the polymerized monomer (ε-CL), the initiator (BnOH), and TBD acting as a catalyst dissolved in toluene. In this three-compound system, there are possible three bimolecular complexes and one trimo-lecularcomplex,ofwhichtheBnOH–TBDbimolecular complex has the lowest Gibbs free energy. Thus, the energy of this most stable complex was taken as the ground state of the system. Based on the results of previous DFT studies of six-membered and larger cyclic lactones56,57 as well as experi-mental data,56,58 we suppose for the calculation of the ROP reaction route the “donor–acceptor” mechanism B, rather than an alternate “amide” mechanism A.59', 'The calculation of the energy profiles (Table S3a†) of the initial step of the ε-CL ROP started with the conformational analysis of the initial structure I1 and the first transition struc- ture TS12 (see Scheme 1). From all obtained conformers, the one showing the lowest Gibbs free energy of TS12 was selected for a detailed study of the ROP mechanism (Scheme 1). The free energy of the starting structure I1 under vacuum is 2.5 kcal mol−1 above the ground state, which agrees very well with the value of 2.8 kcal mol−1 found by Nifant’ev et al.59 for an analogical complex of ε-CL with methanol and TBD. In toluene, this value increases to 4.6 kcal mol−1. This value is only slightly lower than the free energies of the structure I1 of', '@', '@', '@', '@ the 3-isomer and 7-isomer found in our previous study.55 The free energy of the first transition state TS12 of ε-CL was found to be 21.5 kcal mol−1 under vacuum and 22.3 kcal mol−1 in toluene. Both these values lie between the corresponding ener-gies of the TS12 state of the 3-isomer and 7-isomer. This finding indicates that initiation of the ε-CL as well as 7-isomer reaction will be easier than initiation of the 3-isomer one, which is sterically disfavored by the propargyl group bound next to the reactive carbonyl group. Transformation of the structure I2 into I3 proceeds with a small energy barrier of ca. 2 kcal mol−1 and negligible reaction energy. Then, the struc-ture I3 relaxes to its conformers I3r and I3r2. The free energy of the last transition state TS34 is comparable to that of the first transition state TS12. In toluene solution, the last tran-sition state TS34 is the highest one in energy on the whole reaction path. Thus, similarly to the 7-isomer,55 ε-CL may undergo several forward and reverse reactions between the initial state I1 and the intermediate state I3r2 before crossing the TS34 transition state. However, the energy difference between the first transition state TS12 and the highest tran-sition state on the whole reaction path is only ca. 0.3 kcal mol−1 for ε-CL (in toluene), while it is 1.1 kcal mol−1 for the 7-isomer. Thus, we expect that the reverse reaction and its impact on the polymerization rate are much less significant for ε-CL than for the 7-isomer which is in agreement with the homopolymerization kinetic study (left, Fig. 2). Note that for ε-CL under vacuum, TS12 is the highest transition state. The free energy of the I4 state is 4.2 kcal mol−1 under vacuum and', '@', '@ 7.5 kcal mol−1 in toluene, respectively, i.e. it is much lower than that of the TS34 state. The exothermic reaction from the I4 state to the I5 state consists of straightening of the opened ε-CL ring after cleavage of the weak NH–O hydrogen bond. The free energy of the final state I5 is −1.5 kcal mol−1 under vacuum and 1.2 kcal mol−1 in toluene, respectively, with respect to the ground state. Thus, the entire reaction from I1 to I5 is exothermic with a reaction energy of −3 to −4 kcal mol−1. It should be pointed out that in a solution, the hydro-gen bond cleaved in the reaction I4 →I5 can be replaced by a hydrogen bond to surrounding molecules, which further decreases the reaction energy and disfavors the reverse reac-tion I5 →I1.

The obtained results are presented in Table S3b† and compared with our previous data calculated for the polymerization of the 3- and 7-isomers.55 It was found that the free energy of the first transition state TS12 is the highest one (rate limiting) on the whole reaction path for all combinations of the types of the added isomer units (ε-CL, 3-isomer, and 7-isomer) and the chain ends except for addition of the 3-isomer unit to the chain ending with the 7-isomer unit, for which the transition state TS23 is the highest one.', 'The energy barrier of the subsequent step of the ε-CL homopolymerization reaction (24.9 kcal mol−1) is considerably smaller than that of both other compounds (27.7 and 26.0 kcal mol−1), which agrees with the experimental finding that ε-CL homopolymerization is the fastest one (Fig. 4).

The same effect was previously observed in the copolymerization of the 3-isomer with the 7-isomer.55 On the other hand, in the copolymerization of ε-CL with the 3-isomer, the reactivity of the 3-isomer is expected to be lower than the reactivity of ε-CL, similarly to homopolymerization.

In this study, we employed thecontrolled ring-opening copolymerization of oxetane with sulfur-containing comonomers to construct a series of amphiphilic block copolymers featuring thioester and thiocarbonate functionalities. These copo-lymers self-assemble in aqueous solution into aggregates with a sulfur-rich core capable of coordinatingtransition metals. This behavior could be resolved by employing cryo-transmission electron tomography and then extended to complexes incorporating functional coligands. Our study demonstrates how selec-tive catalysis can be harnessed to produce functional polymers with tunable metal coordination pro-perties, paving the way for an emerging class of sulfur-containing copolymers.', 'Introduction', 'Sulfur-containing polymers can show unique properties and functions their all-oxygen analogues do not exhibit, which are associated with the chemistry of the incorporated sulfur atoms.1–5 For example, due to their chemically soft nature, sulfur-containing copolymers are prime candidates for the binding of transition metals via coordinative L-type inter-actions with transition metals.6 This phenomenon has been appliedinnumerousexamplesinthesequestrationof aqueous transition metal impurities, with chemically soft late d-block metals being most strongly bound.7–10 Typically, binding has been utilized in a spatially uncontrolled fashion, meaning that transition metals end up randomly coordinated within a solid polymer matrix. This is perhaps owed to the cir-cumstance that patterned templates to spatially control the coordination, such as block polymers, are hard to access via current polymerization methodologies. Sulfur-containing poly-mers, such as polythioesters and polythiocarbonates, are often synthesized via polycondensation methodologies which only offer access to a limited number of polymer structures and polymer topology.2,3 In this respect much recent work focused on the ring-opening copolymerisation (ROCOP) of a strained heterocycle with an heteroallene such as carbon disulfide (CS2), carbonyl sulfide (COS), isothiocyanates (RNCS, R = aryl, aryl) or thioanhydrides, which give access to sulfur-containing monomers via a chain-growth rather than a step-growth mechanismfromoftencommerciallyaccessible monomers.11–27 Additionally, for sulfur-containing polymers resulting synthesized through these methodologies, examples of metal binding exist such as recent reports on the sequestra-tion of lead from aqueous solutions.28', 'As part of our recent efforts in sulfur-containing ROCOP, we found that the monomer combination of oxetane with either phenylisothiocyanate (PhNCS), phthalic thioanhydride (PTA) or CS2 yields poly(monothioimidocarbonates), poly(ester-alt-thioester)andpoly(dithiocarbonates)respectively (Fig. 1(a)).29–31 Moving from epoxides to oxetane (OX) results insubstantiallymorecontrolledpolymerizationsas primary chain-ends are formed for which propagation is thermodynamicallymorefavoured.Thisledtohighly sequence-selective polymerizations that yield high molecular weight semi-crystalline materials with field-leading melting points of up to 181 °C.32 The chemistry of these novel sulfur-containing copolymers as for example their capability to coor-dinate transition metals remains to be explored. Preliminary experiments in the case of PhNCS suggested the suitability of these methods for block polymer formation via a macro-chain transfer strategy (Fig. 1(b)) that could be employed in self-assembly to form micellar aggregates. However, the extent to which this is transferable to other sulfur-containing ROCOP comonomers remained unresolved. In principle, the formation of these sulfur-containing block copolymers could give access to polymer structures that can spatially confine the coordi-nation of transition metals via combination of the sulfur-con-taining ROCOP block with a non-coordinating block, which we report in this contribution (Fig. 1(c)).', '@', '@', 'Our study begins by surveying all recently developed oxetane-based ROCOPs for block polymer formation. For this α-Me,ω-OH terminated polyethylene glycol (mPEG-OH, sup-plied with a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 5 kDa, 20 eq.) was employed as a macro-chain transfer agent to a polymerization containing 1000 eq. of oxetane and 1000 eq. of arylisothiocyanates (ArNCS), PTA or CS2 respectively per equi-valent of catalyst at 80 °C. Aryl isothiocyanates with different substituents(C6H5(PhNCS),4-methyl-C6H4(MePhNCS), 4-fluoro-C6H4(FPhNCS),3,5-bistrifluoromethyl-C6H4 (CF3PhNCS)) and a chromium(III) based catalyst that has shown quantitative polymerization and >95% linkage selectivity in these types of polymerizations previously were employed.31 In this process, the extension of mPEG-OH by the oxetane copoly-mers occurs on the basis that the alcohol chain ends are deprotonated in situ by catalyst-bound alkoxide intermediates formed from oxetane ring-opening. Hereby, a mPEG alkoxide is transferred onto the catalyst and thereafter propagates to attach the sulfur-containing block, which we established pre-viouslywiththecombinationofoxetaneandPhNCS. Conceptually, mPEG-OH functions as a macro-chain transfer agent.33a Following complete oxetane consumption (as estab-lished by spectroscopic analysis of aliquots) in the respective ROCOPs outlined in Table 1, the resulting polymer was easily isolated by precipitation from methanol. 1H NMR analysis of the purified polymers indicates successful block polymer syn-thesis showing a set of resonances between 4.0 and 1.8 ppm corresponding to ring-opened oxetane as well as resonances for aryl hydrogens in addition to the signals corresponding to mPEG at 3.6 ppm. An integrative ratio of 2.4 to 3.4 repeat units of the ROCOP copolymer per repeat unit of the mPEG block is observed. Importantly, the integrative ratio for the two respect-ive blocks remains unchanged after precipitation of a polymer solution in dichloromethane into methanol. The latter rep-resents a good solvent for mPEG but a poor solvent for the stand-alone ROCOP copolymers so that if the respective blocks were not covalently attached, one would precipitate preferen-tially, thereby changing the ratio of polymers in the mixture. 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) reveals that an alternating microstructure of the ROCOP block is obtained for both PTA and all ArNCS, with no signs of ether linkages formation or scrambling from oxygen/sulfur exchange processes.', 'Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) in tetrahydrofuran compared to a narrow polystyrene standard reference shows an increase in the apparent molecular weight relative to the mPEG macroinitiator (see ESI Fig. S36†) and narrow dispersity values of Đ = 1.1–1.3 in all cases qualitatively supporting block polymer formation. Although dispersity values are low, distri-butionsarenotperfectlymonomodal(seeforexample Fig. 2(b)) visible as, for example, shoulders at the higher mole-cular weight part of the GPC trace. Furthermore, some broad-ening is observed compared to the macroinitiator. This can be tentatively explained by side reactions resembling transesterifi-cation as well as chain end-coupling and an exemplary reac-tion pathway is shown in the ESI (Scheme S6†).33b Hence it is unlikely that the sample exclusively comprises diblock archi-tectures. As summarized in Table 1, the apparent molecular weights by GPC are lower than those determined by NMR pre-sumably due to the differences in chemical structure with respect to the polystyrene standard.', 'Furthermore, the thermal properties of the polymers also support the block formation. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) first heating scans of the as-synthesized 4-F-PhNCS (Fig. S8†), 4-Me-PhNCS (Fig. S17†), and PTA-derived block poly-mers (Fig. S27†) show two distinct melting points for the mPEG and the sulfur-containing blocks. As in the case of the stand-alone ROCOP copolymer, the crystallization from the melt of the sulfur-containing block is very slow. Therefore, thematerialcouldnotcrystallizefromthemelt,even when employing rates as low as 1 °C min−1.

In the corresponding DSC second heating scans, the temperature region corres-ponding to the melting of the sulfur-containing block shows a flat baseline, as these blocks could not crystallize during cooling but also do not exhibit cold crystallization. Fig. S17† shows that for the mPEG-b-(OX-co-MePhNCS) copolymer, the mPEG block exhibits cold crystallization during the second heating scan, followed by melting. However, once again no crystallization or melting could be observed for the sulfur-con-taining blocks.', 'To accelerate the crystallization of the slow-crystallizing sulfur-containing blocks, we have modified the classical self-nucleation protocol to allow the sample to crystallize.35 In the modified self-nucleation strategy,31 the existing crystals in the as-obtained samples are partially melted (see Fig. S1†). The remaining crystal fragments or self-seeds can efficiently nucleate these sulfur-con-taining blocks upon cooling from the self-seeding temperature. In this way, crystallization from the self-seeded melt was observed for the MePhNCS derived copolymers.30,31 The DSC cooling scans from three characteristic self-nucleating temperatures for the mPEG-b-(OX-co-FPhNCS) copolymer are presented in Fig. S9† (left) together with the subsequent heating scans (Fig. S9,† right). The appearance of an exotherm corresponding to the sulfur-con-taining block crystallization can be clearly observed, and the size of the exotherm increases, as expected, with the decrease in the self-nucleation temperature (as a higher number of self-seeds are produced at lower self-nucleation temperatures). In the sub-sequent heating scans, the cold crystallization of the mPEG block can be observed (for two of the self-nucleation temperatures employed), followed by the melting of these crystals at around 40 °C. At higher temperatures, the melting endotherms corres-ponding to the sulfur-containing block crystals can be clearly observed at around 150 °C. These results demonstrate the effec-tiveness of the modified self-nucleation protocol (illustrated in Fig. S1†) in accelerating the overall crystallization of the sulfur-containing blocks. Similar self-nucleation results are presented for the other block copolymers in Fig. S18, S27, and S34.†', 'Furthermore, a stepwise decomposition profile in the thermogravimetric analysis is observed for the isothiocyanate-derivedblockcopolymerscorrespondingtothethermal decomposition of the two respective blocks with the ROCOP block decomposing before the mPEG block. However, not all of the recently developed oxetane ROCOPs tolerate chain transfer agents and block polymerization was not as successful with CS2, although without a macro chain-transfer agent, the polymeriz-ation is highly controlled, delivering poly(dithiocarbonate).29Instead, a complex mixture of different (thio)carbonate linkages is formed alongside small-molecule cyclic thiocarbonate bypro-ducts. Furthermore, GPC analysis of the crude mixture does not reveal an increase in the apparent molecular weight compared to the starting mPEG-OH polymer. These observations can be interpreted in light of recent findings showing that CS2 ROCOP is more prone to side reactions originating from alkoxide chain ends than other sulfur-containing ROCOPs. We infer that chain-transfer agents promote the dissociation of alkoxide chain ends from the catalyst through competitive binding to the catalyst, which subsequently leads to linkage scrambling and cyclic thio-carbonate formation via attack on polymer linkages by the dis-sociated alkoxide.36', 'With a range of block polymers in hand, we studied their self-assembly behavior in water, as the mPEG block is water-soluble while the oxetane-derived blocks are not. For this purpose, the respective block polymer was dissolved in 1,4-dioxane and then added dropwise into water under vigorous stirring. As previously observed for the mPEG-b-(PhNCS-co-OX) polymer, a cloudy but homogeneous solution was formed by nanoprecipitation for all block polymers.31 Dynamic light scat-tering (DLS) experiments suggest the presence of nano-objects with sizes between 69 and 269 nm. Although solutions of the different assembled polymers are all stable over time, they show different stabilities with respect to concentration. To investigate this, DLS-supported dilution experiments were conducted to monitor the evolution of the light scattering intensity, steadily decreasing the concentration of the polymers. As the light scat-tering intensity is proportional to the concentration of a scatter-ing species, this approach efficiently determines the critical con-centration at which the aggregates remain stable prior to disas-sembly. Compared to other techniques, such as fluorescence, DLS has the advantage of allowing a label-free determination of the critical concentration. This not only simplifies determi-nation but also excludes secondary effects between the label (or cargo) and the polymer to influence outcomes, hence not deli-vering the true stability of the pure aggregates. Although there is some uncertainty due to a gradual transition from a signal decrease to the plateau region in some of the DLS traces of the block polymers, they all exhibit excellent stabilities of below 2 mg L−1 which can rival some of the most performant, highly engineered systems in the literature.34 However, in contrast to those, our copolymers are obtained from simple and in most cases, commercially available or easy-to-synthesize building blocks in a one-pot fashion and are hence attractive candidates for applications. Furthermore, we find that the mPEG-b-(PhNCS-co-OX) exhibits a lower critical concentration and hence higher stability than other aggregates, which can be tentatively attribu-ted to more pronounced π–π interactions within the aggregates as has been previously described for highly stable micelles fea-turing an aromatic core.34', 'Accordingly, we thereafter focused our attention on coordi-nation and encapsulation studies employing the assembled mPEG-b-(PhNCS-co-OX) polymer. In order to confirm whether the sulfur-containing block is capable of coordinating tran-sition metals, we first investigated the reaction of the stand-alone PhNCS-co-OX copolymer. Thus, the copolymer was reacted with bright orange bis(benzonitrile)palladium(II)chlor-ide ((PhCN)2PdCl2) featuring easily displaceable benzonitrile coligands and chemically soft PdII for sulfur coordination (Fig. 3(a)). In fact, the addition of a saturated (PhCN)2PdCl2 solution in CH3Cl to a solution of the copolymer results in the immediate precipitation of a dark orange solid, which is in-soluble in all common non-coordinating solvents. While the color change already immediately indicates palladium coordi-nation within the precipitate, energy-dispersive X-ray spec-troscopy (EDX) in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used as a quick test to justify the continuation of the experi-ment. Since no film could be cast due to a lack of solvent and the sample was only to be pressed at room temperature, the surface quality was sufficient for SEM/EDX (see Fig. S38†). The line intensities differ locally due to the roughness but are qualitatively unambiguous and identify the elements Pd and Cl in addition to the elements of the polymer.', '@', '@', 'Motivated by this finding, we then turned to coordinating Pd within our aggregates. Therefore, mPEG-b-(PhNCS-co-OX) was dissolved with 20 wt% (PhCN)2PdCl2 with respect to the polymer in 1,4-dioxane and then added dropwise into water under vigorous stirring. Gratifyingly, a stable orange colloidal solution forms, exhibiting a Tyndall effect. DLS reveals a size increase of the aggregates from 126 nm (without PdCl2) to 170 nm, suggesting some morphological adjustment due to loading with the metal salt, thereby supporting encapsulation. Since we suspected that not all PdCl2 was bound during pre-cipitation, we subjected the aggregates to size exclusion chromatography (SEC). As schematically illustrated in Fig. 3(b) we observed the elution of a sharp orange band corresponding to aggregates with PdCl2 while free palladium salt remained on top of the column.', 'Cryo-transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) reveals the morphology of the aggregates under native, hydrated con-ditions rather than dried conditions. Spherical aggregates were observed to merge into elongated worm-like aggregates with an approximate length of 100 to 300 nm and a thickness of 20–40 nm, which were, however, too irregular for statistical evaluation. The elongated worm-like aggregates consist of mul-tiple merging micelles rather than regular cylindrical structures suggesting that the sulfur-containing cores are likely amorphous in nature rather than semi-crystalline. Interestingly, regions of increased electron density in the aggregates are observed, visible as black dots in the images presented in Fig. 3. These likely correspond to the encapsulated PdCl2 as regions rich in palla-dium, a second-row transition metal, exhibit higher electron densitythanthesurroundingareascomprisinglighter elements. Hence, the encapsulated PdCl2 appears to form dis-crete clusters within the polymer aggregates. We then turned to cryo-electron tomography to spatially resolve where PdCl2 resides. As shown in Fig. 3 areas of increased electron density, highlighted in gold, could be identified in the 3D volume recon-structed from tilt series images (±64°, with 2° increment), and which are highly suspected to be PdCl2. These do not appear to be homogeneously distributed throughout the nanostructure but much rather form a shell around the interior. This could either be due to the coordination of palladium on the surface of a micellar core or within the interior of a vesicular morphology.', 'Having demonstrated the coordination capability of our block polymers, we proceeded to investigate the coordinative encapsulation of complex fragments featuring functional coli- gands. Here, the [(bipyridine)2Ru]2+ was chosen, as it contains coligands that induce phosphorescent metal-to-ligand charge transfer(MLCT)transitions.(Bipyridine)2Ru(BArF)2with hydrophobictetrakis(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)borate (BArF) counteranions was employed in encapsulation studies to support encapsulation within the hydrophobic interior of the aggregates with this hydrophobic counter anion.', 'Initially, the possibility of polymer coordination to the ruthenium complex investigated spectroscopically in a block-non-selective solvent by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Interestingly, the 1H NMR resonances of (bipyridine)2Ru(BArF)2 in CDCl3 exhibit substantial shifting and broadening upon addition of the copolymer with those closest to the ruthenium center being most affected. This clearly indicates a change in coordi-nation environment of the metal and hence coordination of the polymer to ruthenium.', 'Therefore,mPEG-b-(PhNCS-co-OX)wasdissolvedwith 40 wt% ruthenium complex with respect to polymer in 1,4-dioxane and then added dropwise into water under vigorous stirring, forming a turbid luminescent solution (Fig. 4). Importantly, the complex itself is not water-soluble meaning that the homogeneity of the mixture immediately indicates encapsulation into the aggregates. DLS reveals a size of 122 nm for these, and Cryo-TEM shows a spherical mor-phology with a homogeneous electron density distribution throughout the aggregate suggesting a uniform distribution of the complex.', 'Encapsulation is clearly indicated by the optoelectronic pro-perties of the assembly. While (bipyridine)2Ru(BArF)2 in CH3CN solvent shows an emission maximum at approximately 560 nm, it is shifted to 600 nm for the ruthenium complex encapsulated. Having evidenced ruthenium encapsulation, we turned to example applications, such as the generation of singlet oxygen, which is useful in the context of photocatalysis for pollution remediation or organic transformations.37,38 For this, ruthenium-loaded micelles in a buffer solution contain-ing 9,10-anthracenediyl-bis(methylene)dimalonic acid, a dye sensitive to singlet oxygen, were irradiated at 440 nm and ultraviolet–visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra were recorded every 5 minutes.39 As shown in Fig. 4(c) a continuous intensity decrease over time is observed for the diagnostic absorption bands of the dye between 320 and 420 nm clearly demonstrat-ing the capability of our micellar system to produce singlet oxygen.', 'In conclusion, we have presented a series of block polymer syntheses in which sulfur-containing oxetane ROCOP polymers were attached to mPEG via a macro-chain transfer strategy. While a variety of isothiocyanates, as well as phthalic thioanhy-dride, successfully facilitated block polymer formation, side reactions during CS2 ROCOP were exacerbated by the presence of chain-transfer agents. Most block polymers exhibited phase separation in the bulk, resulting in two distinct melting points observed in DSC experiments.

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25�C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 �C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 �10�4 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 �0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 �C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 �C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by significant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of �4 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers.', '�2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through proton exchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Nafion�as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18].', 'Transport properties and nanostructure of sulfonated polyimide (SPI) membranes have been studied using pulsed field gradient NMR and NMR quadrupolar relaxation rates determinations [19,20], and small angle scattering methods (SAXS and SANS), respectively [21,22].', 'The microstructure of sulfonated polyetherether ketone (sPEEK) has been investigated by SAXS [12]. We recently reported a class of ionomers based on aromatic hydrocarbon copolymers with high proton conductivity and excellent thermal mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states [22e29]. Sulfonated poly-arylenethioethersulfone(SPTES)copolymershavefollowing chemical structures (Fig. 1).', 'SPTES copolymers including SPTES-50, SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80, have equivalent weight (EW) and IEC (mequiv./g) values of 610, 515, 459, 417, and 1.64, 1.94, 2.18, and 2.4, respectively [22]. They exhibited proton conductivity of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm respectively, at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity [22]. Their excellent proton conductivity at high temperatures combined with their high glass transition temperature (w200 �C) and mechanical stability (both in the dry and hydrated states) make them excellent potentials as high temperature PEM materials for fuel cells. SPTES-50 copolymer membrane has successfully been fabricated to membrane electrode assemblies and exhibited polarization curves and durability up to 400 h [29]. Their successful operations at 90e100 �C were limited by boiling point of water (100 �C at 1 atm). Replacing water molecules with heterocycles such as imidazolium where the charge carrier has a very low vapor pressure can result in proton conductivity at higher temperatures. Despite excellent electrochemical properties, excessive water uptake of SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes provide difficulties to be made as membrane electrode assembly [22,27] The proton transport and performance of SPTES copolymers highly depend on the presence of water molecules. In addition to the number of sulfonic groups, their acidity (pKa) ability to dissociate water molecules to proton, water activity coefficient, and number of water molecules associated with each sulfonic group, the supermolecular structure of the hydro-phobic and hydrophilic phases is also defined by polymer chain characteristics such as chain persistent length, and presence of sulfonic group on the backbone or in the side chains. We reported the presence of ionic nanodomains containing water molecules in the SPTES-70 using in-situ x-ray scattering [27]. The morphology and the nanostructure of SPTES-50 were approximated by corre-lated polydisperse spherical aggregates and a larger scale water domain network and were quantified by modeling of the SANS spectra with polydisperse hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [29]. This study reports the nanostructure and morphology of sulfonated polyarylenethioethersulfone (SPTES) copolymer membranes which is directly related to the proton transport through the membrane in terms of their degree of sulfonation and temperature dependency.', '2. Materials and methods', '2.1. Materials', 'Visually observed defect free films of SPTES copolymers were prepared by dissolving the purified copolymer in dimethyl acet-amide (DMAc, Sigma Aldrich) (5e10 wt%) filtering, placing in a flat dish in a vacuum oven with a gradual temperature rise to 100 �C for 24 h and 120 �C for 2 h. The resulting uniform flat films were immersed for 2 h in deionized water and dried under vacuum (24 h, 80 �C) after they were acidified in sulfuric acid (4 M, 24 h) to ensure complete conversion of sulfonic groups to their protonated forms.', '2.2. Characterization', 'SANS experiments were performed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Neutron Center for Research using 30 m NG-7 SANS instrument with a neutron wavelength, l, of 6 Å (Dl/l ¼ 10%) and three sample-to-detector distance of 1.5 m, 10 m (l ¼ 6 Å), and 15 m (l ¼ 8 Å), 0.001 < q < 0.3168 Å�1 at 25, and 55 �C (accuracy of 0.5 �C). Hydrated membranes were placed in demountable 1 mm thick titanium liquid cells filled with D2O after equilibrium in D2O (24 h). Scattered intensities were reduced, corrected for the transmission and background and placed on absolute scale. Then, circularly averaged to produce absolute scale scattering intensity, I(q), as a function of the wave vector, q, where q ¼ (4p/l)sin(q/2) and q is the scattering angle. Calculations were performed using Igor Pro�software [30,31]. USANS experiments covered a q-range of 0.00005 < q (Å�1) < 0.01, corresponding to a real-space length scale of 0.1 microne10 micron.', '3. Results and discussions', '3.1. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 25 �C', 'SPTES copolymers have high proton conductivity at high relative humidities and elevated temperatures; e.g. 65 �C and 85% RH of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers, respectively [27]. The degree of sulfonation increases for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6%, respectively. SPTES-50 copolymer has the lowest the degree of sulfonation and SPTES-80 copolymer has the highest degree of sulfonation in this class of copolymers [22,27]. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers at 25 �C show a scattering behavior of a two phase structure (Fig. 2a). The contribution of sulfonic groups to the scattering is considered to be negligible due to their small volume compared to the polymer and the water phase volume. It was visually observed that membranes do not dissociate when fully hydrated in the examined temperature. It was also determined by weight measurement that the membranes maintain the weight after deswelling. Therefore, the hydrophobic polymeric structure is the supporting network even at high water content and increased temperatures. Fig. 2a presents enhanced scattering intensity data (vertically shifted) for the hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copol-ymer membranes in the order of 20X, 1000X, and 2 �105X for the clarity of data presentation. The absolute scale scattering intensities in the medium q range of 0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1 are almost in the same intensity range for all SPTES copolymers. The high q scattering spectra for all copolymers exhibit a feature which is attributed to the presence of ionic domains containing water molecules. According to the scattering results, the morphology of all hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C can be approximated as correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates with liquid-like ordering (P.Y. ordering) and a power law decay [29]. The scattering data for the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C were compared and quantified using polydisperse (Schulz polydispersity) hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [32e34] and a low q power law decay [29]. The modeling of the SPETS 50 nanostructure and its properties have been reported elsewhere but presented here for clarity and completeness of the SPTES series analysis [29]. Fig. 2b shows the experimental scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 25 �C compared with the theoretical calculations of the model (solid line). The results of the comparison of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes scattering data with the model are summarized in Table 1. According to this modeling the domain radius increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 13.45,14.9,15.4, and 16.9 Å for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes. The hard sphere packing density increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 19.8%, 23%, 25%, 29% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. This could indicate that ionic domains are capable of holding more water molecules with the presence of more sulfonic groups on the polymer backbone (increasing the degree of sulfonation). The high-q scattering spectra exhibits onset of a peak formation when the degree of sulfonation was increased to 71.6% for SPTES-80 copolymer. Pres-ence of scattering maxima can be due to the scattering from an ordered structure (periodicity) or the oscillations resulted from the structural factor effects or the excluded volume effect arising from short range liquid-like ordering. The onset of peak formation is attributed to the excluded volume effects related to the liquid-like ordering [33e35]. The low-q power law decay of nearly �3 was observed for all SPTES copolymers in the range of 1 �10�4 < q (1/ Å) < 3 �10�3. The power law decay of �3 is attributed to the presence of interacting three-dimensional fractal morphology. In addition, a Guinier plateau [35] was present for the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer at the very low q (q (1/Å) < 9 �10�5). This is in addition to the nearly identical scattering intensity in the inter-mediate q-range (0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1). It can be concluded that the change in the degree of sulfonation had little or no effect on the intermediate and low angle scattering wave vector. The low-q power law decay was nearly �3 �0.1 for all SPTES copolymers. The presence of sharp interface between hydrophobic and hydro-philic domains was deduced from the power law decay of �4 at large angle wave vectors for all hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes. All scattering data presented in Fig. 2a shows a power slope of �3.85 to �4.15 which is approximated as w �4. The presence of Porod behavior (decay of �4) has been attributed to the two immiscible phase with a sharp boundary [35e37]. This shows that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are separated with a distinct interface containing sulfonic groups.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Presence of a plateau in the scattering spectra is characteristics of isolated scatterers [35]. The radius of gyration (Rg) of the isolated scatterers can be approximated by IðqÞ ¼ I0expðð�q2R2gÞ=3Þ, where I0 is the extrapolated zero scattering intensity (Guinier approxi-mation) [35]. Presence of the Guinier plateau in the q range of 4.3 �10�5 < q (1/Å) < 8.2 �10�5 for SPTES-80 copolymer suggests segregation of the isolated large scale hydrophilic water pockets when the degree of sulfonation increased to 71.6%. Radius of gyration of the isolated larger scale water pockets in fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was 1.3 �0.18 micron which was calculated from this approximation (Fig. 2c).', '@', '@', '3.2. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 55 �C', 'Based on the physical observations, water saturated membranes at 55 �C were swollen films without visual dissociation. Fig. 3 exhibits the scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. The inter-mediate scattering intensity decreased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes start to form scattering maxima at high q range when the degree of sulfonation increased. This indicated the increase in the excluded volume due to the increase in the volume of the scatterers at higher degree of sulfonation and increased temperature (55 �C). The presence of scattering maxima is more significant for SPTES-70 copolymer and SPTES-80 copolymer with 63.3 and 71.6% degree of sulfonation. The large angle scattering feature shows scattering maxima at qmax of 0.103 and 0.1108 1/Å for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers which correspond to spatial characteristics lengths (l ¼ 2p/qmax) of 60.97 and 56.7 Å due to concentration fluctuations of hydrated domains (hard spheres). The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes changed significantlywith increasing degree of sulfonation. This indicates a substantial change in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology with increasing degree of sulfonation at 55 �C which is more pronounced for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers (degree of sulfonation 63.3 and 71.6%, respectively). Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are segregated distinctly by the sulfonic groups at the interface which is repre-sented by the Porod behavior, asymptotic behavior of w �4 for all SPTES copolymers [35e37]. The morphology of these membranes is complex and controlled by interfacial phenomena. The number of sulfonic groups per repeat unit volume and their acidity com-plemented with the chain persistent length and chain mobility are governing factors in the formed morphology. This study approxi-mates the morphology of the fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55 �C are approximated as spherical nanodomains containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering similar to their morphology at 25 �C. It is also proposed that this morphology changedtofractalmorphologywithincreasing temperature (increasing the intermediate scattering decay). The domain radius and the sphere packing density were increased from 26.4 Å and 28% for SPTES-50 copolymer to 32 Å and 33% for SPTES-60copolymerwhiletheintermediatescatteringintensity decreased. The domain radius and packing density of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane increased from 13.45 Å and 19.8% to 26.4 Å and 28% when the temperature increased from 25 �C to 55 �C with this approximation. The same increasing trend of 14.9 Åe32 Å for the average domain radius and 23%e33% of the sphere packing density was observed. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane compared to the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane is attributed to the disruption of the large scale morphology. The low q power law decay of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane was close to the decay of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane.', 'The increase in the degree of sulfonation of SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymers from 54.9, to 63.3 and 71.6% resulted in a shift in the position of the high q scattering maxima of the hydrated membranes toward the large angle scattering regime. This peak formation is more prominent for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copoly-mers with higher sulfonation degree. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering intensity in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers is attributed to the loss of the large scale water network, intermediate fractal morphology within the polymer and onset of a morphology change to a two large scale phase morphology. The closed domain morphology of polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with fractal network were present for fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55�C (Figs. 3 and 4a). However, substantialchangesinthemorphologyoffullyhydrated membranes occurred when the degree of sulfonation is increased to 63.3 and 71.6% for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers at higher temperature of 55 �C. Combination of high temperature, high density of sulfonic groups, and significant amount of water mole-cules within the polymer backbone could have resulted in the coalescence of the small spherical ionic domains and fractal water network into a larger scale bicontinuous network of intermeshed hydrophobic and hydrophilic morphology for fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane at 55 �C. The bicontinuous model origi-nally proposed for micro-emulsion of two immiscible phases of water and oil with comparable amount based on Landau theory [38,39]. This model describes two irregular shapes with distinct boundary and has been used for intermesh of hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure when the particle shape is not well-defined [40,41]. This model proposes I(q) ¼ (a2þc1q þ c2q2)�1 for a2 > 0, c1 < 0, and c2 > 0, a single broad scattering maxima, and power law decay of �4 at large scattering angles. Two characteristics lengths of d and x are deduced from this analysis having a2, c1, and c2[39,40], d is the domain periodicity or interdomain distance and x is the correlation length which has been attributed to the dispersion of d. According to this theory, c1 is negative due to the surfactant. The absolute values of c1 and the ratio of x/d should increase with increasing surfactant. The specific internal surface area can be derived from the ratio of S/V ¼ 44(1�4)/x [38,39].', 'The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane has a low-q upturn, a lower intermediate scattering intensity compared to the hydrated SPTES-60 and SPTES-50 copolymers, and a large angle maxima followed by a power law decay of �4. This indicates the onset of the coalescence of the ionic aggregates, disruption of the fractal water network, and the formation of the two irregular large scale bicontinuous phase morphology. The high q range (q > 0.037 1/Å) of the scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 55 �C was compared with the T.S. bicontinuous model (Fig. 4b). This simulation resulted in a periodicity, d, of 59.9 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima position, 60.97 Å. According to this simulation, the correlation length (x) is 31.14 Å. The medium-q range scattering still exhibits the larger scale morphology which is not completely converted to the bi-continuous phase morphology. However, they are partially collapsed characterized by a lower scattering intensity in the intermediate q range. The high q maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 is approximated as bicontinuous morphology. The low and medium q (q < 0.037 1/Å) scattering spectra of the SPTES 70 is due to the presence of fractal network of waters which have not coalesce yet.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The scattering spectra of the SPTES-80 copolymer are consistent with a bicontinuous two phase structure of irregular shapes with sulfonic groups as interfacial ionic region. The scattering experi-mental data of the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was compared with this model (q > 0.015 1/Å), (Fig. 4c and Table 2). The periodicity of the water domains (or hydrophobic domains), d, predicted by this model is w54 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima (qmax), 56.7 Å. This value is the distance between water domains. The correlation length (x) obtained from this model is 37.86 Å which is a measure of dispersion.', 'The distance between the water phases, periodicity, was decreased from 59.9 Å to 54 Å with increasing degree of sulfona-tion. The correlation length, x, was increased from 31.14 Å to 37.86 Å when the degree of sulfonation increased. Increasing the interfacial area results in an increase in the x/d ratio. The presence of the upturn in the low range of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 at 55 �C (Fig. 4b and c) is attributed to the fractal morphology of the large scale features.', '3.3. Discussions', 'Scattering data of series of SPTES membranes were obtained in the full hydration state with increasing the sulfonation degree in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. Complete study was performed to provide understanding membranes morphology with increasing the temperature of the hydrated membranes from 25 �C to 55 �C. Proposed model assumes spherical nanodomains containing water molecules forming from clustering of the sulfonation groups. This assumption was performed based on previously reported study which showed spherical nanodomains in the dry SPTES 50 membrane under HR-TEM [29]. The scattering spectra of the membranes with high degree of sulfonation (SPTES 70, and 80) changed significantly when the temperature increased to 55 �C. The morphology is approximated as bi-continuous system where the hydrocarbon is the main support network containing water. This model has been recently proposed by Wnek et al. [40], Gebel [8], and Kreuer [12], Wnek also provided visualization of the hydro-phobic cluster using SYBYL version 6.7 (Tripos) and HINT (Hydro-pathicINTeractions)computationalmodelingsoftware[40]. Despite the support of the transport studies of this model [42], there is no direct visualization method for this proposed approxi-mation. The T. S. model is also supported by high proton conduc-tivity of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 membranes at 55 �C where a larger number of hydronium ions in a larger domain can facilitate proton transport. A summary of the structural evolution of the SPTES membranes as a function of temperature and degree of sulfonation is illustrated in Table 3. This study attempted to study a full range of SPTES membrane nanostructure for the first time and provide an understanding of large membrane water uptakes, and their morphology and their relation with high conductivity of the membranes using both liquid like ordering of polydisperse nano-spheres and bi-continuous T.S. model approximation.', '@', '@', 'Table 3 Summary of membrane structural changes (SPTES 50, 60, 70, and 80 at 25 �C, and SPTES 50 and 60 at 55 �C) as a function of degree of sulfonation and temperature by polydisperse hard sphere model with liquid-like ordering ordering). T.S. bi-continuous model was approximated for higher sulfonation degree copolymers, SPTES 70 and 80, at 55 �C.', '@', '4. Conclusions', 'A series of SPTES copolymers with high proton conductivity of 100e215 mS/cm at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity as potential fuel cells membranes were studied. SANS studies of fully hydrated membranes showed that the nanostructure of the fully hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C in agreement with ionic aggregates containing water molecules with a large scale morphology network of water pockets morphology. This model predicted that the increase in the degree of sulfonation resulted in an increase in the radius of ionic domains and an increase in the volume packing density of water in the aggregates. It was assumed that the same morphology of polydisperse correlated spherical ionic domains were present in the SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymers when the temperature increased to 55 �C. Increase in the degree of sulfonation for fully hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer at 55 �C led to a substantial reorganization of the membrane morphology which was described by a bi-continuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic network.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to thank the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Nano-structured andBiological Materials Branch forfunding this research.

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25�C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 �C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 �10�4 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 �0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 �C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 �C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by significant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of �4 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers.', '�2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through proton exchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Nafion�as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18].', 'Transport properties and nanostructure of sulfonated polyimide (SPI) membranes have been studied using pulsed field gradient NMR and NMR quadrupolar relaxation rates determinations [19,20], and small angle scattering methods (SAXS and SANS), respectively [21,22].', 'The microstructure of sulfonated polyetherether ketone (sPEEK) has been investigated by SAXS [12]. We recently reported a class of ionomers based on aromatic hydrocarbon copolymers with high proton conductivity and excellent thermal mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states [22e29]. Sulfonated poly-arylenethioethersulfone(SPTES)copolymershavefollowing chemical structures (Fig. 1).', 'SPTES copolymers including SPTES-50, SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80, have equivalent weight (EW) and IEC (mequiv./g) values of 610, 515, 459, 417, and 1.64, 1.94, 2.18, and 2.4, respectively [22]. They exhibited proton conductivity of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm respectively, at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity [22]. Their excellent proton conductivity at high temperatures combined with their high glass transition temperature (w200 �C) and mechanical stability (both in the dry and hydrated states) make them excellent potentials as high temperature PEM materials for fuel cells. SPTES-50 copolymer membrane has successfully been fabricated to membrane electrode assemblies and exhibited polarization curves and durability up to 400 h [29]. Their successful operations at 90e100 �C were limited by boiling point of water (100 �C at 1 atm). Replacing water molecules with heterocycles such as imidazolium where the charge carrier has a very low vapor pressure can result in proton conductivity at higher temperatures. Despite excellent electrochemical properties, excessive water uptake of SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes provide difficulties to be made as membrane electrode assembly [22,27] The proton transport and performance of SPTES copolymers highly depend on the presence of water molecules. In addition to the number of sulfonic groups, their acidity (pKa) ability to dissociate water molecules to proton, water activity coefficient, and number of water molecules associated with each sulfonic group, the supermolecular structure of the hydro-phobic and hydrophilic phases is also defined by polymer chain characteristics such as chain persistent length, and presence of sulfonic group on the backbone or in the side chains. We reported the presence of ionic nanodomains containing water molecules in the SPTES-70 using in-situ x-ray scattering [27]. The morphology and the nanostructure of SPTES-50 were approximated by corre-lated polydisperse spherical aggregates and a larger scale water domain network and were quantified by modeling of the SANS spectra with polydisperse hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [29]. This study reports the nanostructure and morphology of sulfonated polyarylenethioethersulfone (SPTES) copolymer membranes which is directly related to the proton transport through the membrane in terms of their degree of sulfonation and temperature dependency.', '2. Materials and methods', '2.1. Materials', 'Visually observed defect free films of SPTES copolymers were prepared by dissolving the purified copolymer in dimethyl acet-amide (DMAc, Sigma Aldrich) (5e10 wt%) filtering, placing in a flat dish in a vacuum oven with a gradual temperature rise to 100 �C for 24 h and 120 �C for 2 h. The resulting uniform flat films were immersed for 2 h in deionized water and dried under vacuum (24 h, 80 �C) after they were acidified in sulfuric acid (4 M, 24 h) to ensure complete conversion of sulfonic groups to their protonated forms.', '2.2. Characterization', 'SANS experiments were performed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Neutron Center for Research using 30 m NG-7 SANS instrument with a neutron wavelength, l, of 6 Å (Dl/l ¼ 10%) and three sample-to-detector distance of 1.5 m, 10 m (l ¼ 6 Å), and 15 m (l ¼ 8 Å), 0.001 < q < 0.3168 Å�1 at 25, and 55 �C (accuracy of 0.5 �C). Hydrated membranes were placed in demountable 1 mm thick titanium liquid cells filled with D2O after equilibrium in D2O (24 h). Scattered intensities were reduced, corrected for the transmission and background and placed on absolute scale. Then, circularly averaged to produce absolute scale scattering intensity, I(q), as a function of the wave vector, q, where q ¼ (4p/l)sin(q/2) and q is the scattering angle. Calculations were performed using Igor Pro�software [30,31]. USANS experiments covered a q-range of 0.00005 < q (Å�1) < 0.01, corresponding to a real-space length scale of 0.1 microne10 micron.', '3. Results and discussions', '3.1. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 25 �C', 'SPTES copolymers have high proton conductivity at high relative humidities and elevated temperatures; e.g. 65 �C and 85% RH of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers, respectively [27]. The degree of sulfonation increases for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6%, respectively. SPTES-50 copolymer has the lowest the degree of sulfonation and SPTES-80 copolymer has the highest degree of sulfonation in this class of copolymers [22,27]. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers at 25 �C show a scattering behavior of a two phase structure (Fig. 2a). The contribution of sulfonic groups to the scattering is considered to be negligible due to their small volume compared to the polymer and the water phase volume. It was visually observed that membranes do not dissociate when fully hydrated in the examined temperature. It was also determined by weight measurement that the membranes maintain the weight after deswelling. Therefore, the hydrophobic polymeric structure is the supporting network even at high water content and increased temperatures. Fig. 2a presents enhanced scattering intensity data (vertically shifted) for the hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copol-ymer membranes in the order of 20X, 1000X, and 2 �105X for the clarity of data presentation. The absolute scale scattering intensities in the medium q range of 0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1 are almost in the same intensity range for all SPTES copolymers. The high q scattering spectra for all copolymers exhibit a feature which is attributed to the presence of ionic domains containing water molecules. According to the scattering results, the morphology of all hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C can be approximated as correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates with liquid-like ordering (P.Y. ordering) and a power law decay [29]. The scattering data for the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C were compared and quantified using polydisperse (Schulz polydispersity) hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [32e34] and a low q power law decay [29]. The modeling of the SPETS 50 nanostructure and its properties have been reported elsewhere but presented here for clarity and completeness of the SPTES series analysis [29]. Fig. 2b shows the experimental scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 25 �C compared with the theoretical calculations of the model (solid line). The results of the comparison of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes scattering data with the model are summarized in Table 1. According to this modeling the domain radius increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 13.45,14.9,15.4, and 16.9 Å for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes. The hard sphere packing density increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 19.8%, 23%, 25%, 29% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. This could indicate that ionic domains are capable of holding more water molecules with the presence of more sulfonic groups on the polymer backbone (increasing the degree of sulfonation). The high-q scattering spectra exhibits onset of a peak formation when the degree of sulfonation was increased to 71.6% for SPTES-80 copolymer. Pres-ence of scattering maxima can be due to the scattering from an ordered structure (periodicity) or the oscillations resulted from the structural factor effects or the excluded volume effect arising from short range liquid-like ordering. The onset of peak formation is attributed to the excluded volume effects related to the liquid-like ordering [33e35]. The low-q power law decay of nearly �3 was observed for all SPTES copolymers in the range of 1 �10�4 < q (1/ Å) < 3 �10�3. The power law decay of �3 is attributed to the presence of interacting three-dimensional fractal morphology. In addition, a Guinier plateau [35] was present for the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer at the very low q (q (1/Å) < 9 �10�5). This is in addition to the nearly identical scattering intensity in the inter-mediate q-range (0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1). It can be concluded that the change in the degree of sulfonation had little or no effect on the intermediate and low angle scattering wave vector. The low-q power law decay was nearly �3 �0.1 for all SPTES copolymers. The presence of sharp interface between hydrophobic and hydro-philic domains was deduced from the power law decay of �4 at large angle wave vectors for all hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes. All scattering data presented in Fig. 2a shows a power slope of �3.85 to �4.15 which is approximated as w �4. The presence of Porod behavior (decay of �4) has been attributed to the two immiscible phase with a sharp boundary [35e37]. This shows that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are separated with a distinct interface containing sulfonic groups.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Presence of a plateau in the scattering spectra is characteristics of isolated scatterers [35]. The radius of gyration (Rg) of the isolated scatterers can be approximated by IðqÞ ¼ I0expðð�q2R2gÞ=3Þ, where I0 is the extrapolated zero scattering intensity (Guinier approxi-mation) [35]. Presence of the Guinier plateau in the q range of 4.3 �10�5 < q (1/Å) < 8.2 �10�5 for SPTES-80 copolymer suggests segregation of the isolated large scale hydrophilic water pockets when the degree of sulfonation increased to 71.6%. Radius of gyration of the isolated larger scale water pockets in fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was 1.3 �0.18 micron which was calculated from this approximation (Fig. 2c).', '@', '@', '3.2. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 55 �C', 'Based on the physical observations, water saturated membranes at 55 �C were swollen films without visual dissociation. Fig. 3 exhibits the scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. The inter-mediate scattering intensity decreased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes start to form scattering maxima at high q range when the degree of sulfonation increased. This indicated the increase in the excluded volume due to the increase in the volume of the scatterers at higher degree of sulfonation and increased temperature (55 �C). The presence of scattering maxima is more significant for SPTES-70 copolymer and SPTES-80 copolymer with 63.3 and 71.6% degree of sulfonation. The large angle scattering feature shows scattering maxima at qmax of 0.103 and 0.1108 1/Å for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers which correspond to spatial characteristics lengths (l ¼ 2p/qmax) of 60.97 and 56.7 Å due to concentration fluctuations of hydrated domains (hard spheres). The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes changed significantlywith increasing degree of sulfonation. This indicates a substantial change in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology with increasing degree of sulfonation at 55 �C which is more pronounced for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers (degree of sulfonation 63.3 and 71.6%, respectively). Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are segregated distinctly by the sulfonic groups at the interface which is repre-sented by the Porod behavior, asymptotic behavior of w �4 for all SPTES copolymers [35e37]. The morphology of these membranes is complex and controlled by interfacial phenomena. The number of sulfonic groups per repeat unit volume and their acidity com-plemented with the chain persistent length and chain mobility are governing factors in the formed morphology. This study approxi-mates the morphology of the fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55 �C are approximated as spherical nanodomains containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering similar to their morphology at 25 �C. It is also proposed that this morphology changedtofractalmorphologywithincreasing temperature (increasing the intermediate scattering decay). The domain radius and the sphere packing density were increased from 26.4 Å and 28% for SPTES-50 copolymer to 32 Å and 33% for SPTES-60copolymerwhiletheintermediatescatteringintensity decreased. The domain radius and packing density of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane increased from 13.45 Å and 19.8% to 26.4 Å and 28% when the temperature increased from 25 �C to 55 �C with this approximation. The same increasing trend of 14.9 Åe32 Å for the average domain radius and 23%e33% of the sphere packing density was observed. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane compared to the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane is attributed to the disruption of the large scale morphology. The low q power law decay of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane was close to the decay of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane.', 'The increase in the degree of sulfonation of SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymers from 54.9, to 63.3 and 71.6% resulted in a shift in the position of the high q scattering maxima of the hydrated membranes toward the large angle scattering regime. This peak formation is more prominent for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copoly-mers with higher sulfonation degree. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering intensity in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers is attributed to the loss of the large scale water network, intermediate fractal morphology within the polymer and onset of a morphology change to a two large scale phase morphology. The closed domain morphology of polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with fractal network were present for fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55�C (Figs. 3 and 4a). However, substantialchangesinthemorphologyoffullyhydrated membranes occurred when the degree of sulfonation is increased to 63.3 and 71.6% for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers at higher temperature of 55 �C. Combination of high temperature, high density of sulfonic groups, and significant amount of water mole-cules within the polymer backbone could have resulted in the coalescence of the small spherical ionic domains and fractal water network into a larger scale bicontinuous network of intermeshed hydrophobic and hydrophilic morphology for fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane at 55 �C. The bicontinuous model origi-nally proposed for micro-emulsion of two immiscible phases of water and oil with comparable amount based on Landau theory [38,39]. This model describes two irregular shapes with distinct boundary and has been used for intermesh of hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure when the particle shape is not well-defined [40,41]. This model proposes I(q) ¼ (a2þc1q þ c2q2)�1 for a2 > 0, c1 < 0, and c2 > 0, a single broad scattering maxima, and power law decay of �4 at large scattering angles. Two characteristics lengths of d and x are deduced from this analysis having a2, c1, and c2[39,40], d is the domain periodicity or interdomain distance and x is the correlation length which has been attributed to the dispersion of d. According to this theory, c1 is negative due to the surfactant. The absolute values of c1 and the ratio of x/d should increase with increasing surfactant. The specific internal surface area can be derived from the ratio of S/V ¼ 44(1�4)/x [38,39].', 'The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane has a low-q upturn, a lower intermediate scattering intensity compared to the hydrated SPTES-60 and SPTES-50 copolymers, and a large angle maxima followed by a power law decay of �4. This indicates the onset of the coalescence of the ionic aggregates, disruption of the fractal water network, and the formation of the two irregular large scale bicontinuous phase morphology. The high q range (q > 0.037 1/Å) of the scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 55 �C was compared with the T.S. bicontinuous model (Fig. 4b). This simulation resulted in a periodicity, d, of 59.9 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima position, 60.97 Å. According to this simulation, the correlation length (x) is 31.14 Å. The medium-q range scattering still exhibits the larger scale morphology which is not completely converted to the bi-continuous phase morphology. However, they are partially collapsed characterized by a lower scattering intensity in the intermediate q range. The high q maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 is approximated as bicontinuous morphology. The low and medium q (q < 0.037 1/Å) scattering spectra of the SPTES 70 is due to the presence of fractal network of waters which have not coalesce yet.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The scattering spectra of the SPTES-80 copolymer are consistent with a bicontinuous two phase structure of irregular shapes with sulfonic groups as interfacial ionic region. The scattering experi-mental data of the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was compared with this model (q > 0.015 1/Å), (Fig. 4c and Table 2). The periodicity of the water domains (or hydrophobic domains), d, predicted by this model is w54 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima (qmax), 56.7 Å. This value is the distance between water domains. The correlation length (x) obtained from this model is 37.86 Å which is a measure of dispersion.', 'The distance between the water phases, periodicity, was decreased from 59.9 Å to 54 Å with increasing degree of sulfona-tion. The correlation length, x, was increased from 31.14 Å to 37.86 Å when the degree of sulfonation increased. Increasing the interfacial area results in an increase in the x/d ratio. The presence of the upturn in the low range of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 at 55 �C (Fig. 4b and c) is attributed to the fractal morphology of the large scale features.', '3.3. Discussions', 'Scattering data of series of SPTES membranes were obtained in the full hydration state with increasing the sulfonation degree in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. Complete study was performed to provide understanding membranes morphology with increasing the temperature of the hydrated membranes from 25 �C to 55 �C. Proposed model assumes spherical nanodomains containing water molecules forming from clustering of the sulfonation groups. This assumption was performed based on previously reported study which showed spherical nanodomains in the dry SPTES 50 membrane under HR-TEM [29]. The scattering spectra of the membranes with high degree of sulfonation (SPTES 70, and 80) changed significantly when the temperature increased to 55 �C. The morphology is approximated as bi-continuous system where the hydrocarbon is the main support network containing water. This model has been recently proposed by Wnek et al. [40], Gebel [8], and Kreuer [12], Wnek also provided visualization of the hydro-phobic cluster using SYBYL version 6.7 (Tripos) and HINT (Hydro-pathicINTeractions)computationalmodelingsoftware[40]. Despite the support of the transport studies of this model [42], there is no direct visualization method for this proposed approxi-mation. The T. S. model is also supported by high proton conduc-tivity of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 membranes at 55 �C where a larger number of hydronium ions in a larger domain can facilitate proton transport. A summary of the structural evolution of the SPTES membranes as a function of temperature and degree of sulfonation is illustrated in Table 3. This study attempted to study a full range of SPTES membrane nanostructure for the first time and provide an understanding of large membrane water uptakes, and their morphology and their relation with high conductivity of the membranes using both liquid like ordering of polydisperse nano-spheres and bi-continuous T.S. model approximation.', '@', '@', 'Table 3 Summary of membrane structural changes (SPTES 50, 60, 70, and 80 at 25 �C, and SPTES 50 and 60 at 55 �C) as a function of degree of sulfonation and temperature by polydisperse hard sphere model with liquid-like ordering ordering).

Conclusions', 'A series of SPTES copolymers with high proton conductivity of 100e215 mS/cm at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity as potential fuel cells membranes were studied. SANS studies of fully hydrated membranes showed that the nanostructure of the fully hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C in agreement with ionic aggregates containing water molecules with a large scale morphology network of water pockets morphology. This model predicted that the increase in the degree of sulfonation resulted in an increase in the radius of ionic domains and an increase in the volume packing density of water in the aggregates. It was assumed that the same morphology of polydisperse correlated spherical ionic domains were present in the SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymers when the temperature increased to 55 �C. Increase in the degree of sulfonation for fully hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer at 55 �C led to a substantial reorganization of the membrane morphology which was described by a bi-continuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic network.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to thank the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Nano-structured andBiological Materials Branch forfunding this research.

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25�C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 �C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 �10�4 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 �0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 �C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 �C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by significant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of �4 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers.', '�2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through proton exchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Nafion�as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18].', 'Transport properties and nanostructure of sulfonated polyimide (SPI) membranes have been studied using pulsed field gradient NMR and NMR quadrupolar relaxation rates determinations [19,20], and small angle scattering methods (SAXS and SANS), respectively [21,22].', 'The microstructure of sulfonated polyetherether ketone (sPEEK) has been investigated by SAXS [12]. We recently reported a class of ionomers based on aromatic hydrocarbon copolymers with high proton conductivity and excellent thermal mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states [22e29]. Sulfonated poly-arylenethioethersulfone(SPTES)copolymershavefollowing chemical structures (Fig. 1).', 'SPTES copolymers including SPTES-50, SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80, have equivalent weight (EW) and IEC (mequiv./g) values of 610, 515, 459, 417, and 1.64, 1.94, 2.18, and 2.4, respectively [22]. They exhibited proton conductivity of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm respectively, at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity [22]. Their excellent proton conductivity at high temperatures combined with their high glass transition temperature (w200 �C) and mechanical stability (both in the dry and hydrated states) make them excellent potentials as high temperature PEM materials for fuel cells. SPTES-50 copolymer membrane has successfully been fabricated to membrane electrode assemblies and exhibited polarization curves and durability up to 400 h [29]. Their successful operations at 90e100 �C were limited by boiling point of water (100 �C at 1 atm). Replacing water molecules with heterocycles such as imidazolium where the charge carrier has a very low vapor pressure can result in proton conductivity at higher temperatures. Despite excellent electrochemical properties, excessive water uptake of SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes provide difficulties to be made as membrane electrode assembly [22,27] The proton transport and performance of SPTES copolymers highly depend on the presence of water molecules. In addition to the number of sulfonic groups, their acidity (pKa) ability to dissociate water molecules to proton, water activity coefficient, and number of water molecules associated with each sulfonic group, the supermolecular structure of the hydro-phobic and hydrophilic phases is also defined by polymer chain characteristics such as chain persistent length, and presence of sulfonic group on the backbone or in the side chains. We reported the presence of ionic nanodomains containing water molecules in the SPTES-70 using in-situ x-ray scattering [27]. The morphology and the nanostructure of SPTES-50 were approximated by corre-lated polydisperse spherical aggregates and a larger scale water domain network and were quantified by modeling of the SANS spectra with polydisperse hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [29]. This study reports the nanostructure and morphology of sulfonated polyarylenethioethersulfone (SPTES) copolymer membranes which is directly related to the proton transport through the membrane in terms of their degree of sulfonation and temperature dependency.', '2. Materials and methods', '2.1. Materials', 'Visually observed defect free films of SPTES copolymers were prepared by dissolving the purified copolymer in dimethyl acet-amide (DMAc, Sigma Aldrich) (5e10 wt%) filtering, placing in a flat dish in a vacuum oven with a gradual temperature rise to 100 �C for 24 h and 120 �C for 2 h. The resulting uniform flat films were immersed for 2 h in deionized water and dried under vacuum (24 h, 80 �C) after they were acidified in sulfuric acid (4 M, 24 h) to ensure complete conversion of sulfonic groups to their protonated forms.', '2.2. Characterization', 'SANS experiments were performed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Neutron Center for Research using 30 m NG-7 SANS instrument with a neutron wavelength, l, of 6 Å (Dl/l ¼ 10%) and three sample-to-detector distance of 1.5 m, 10 m (l ¼ 6 Å), and 15 m (l ¼ 8 Å), 0.001 < q < 0.3168 Å�1 at 25, and 55 �C (accuracy of 0.5 �C). Hydrated membranes were placed in demountable 1 mm thick titanium liquid cells filled with D2O after equilibrium in D2O (24 h). Scattered intensities were reduced, corrected for the transmission and background and placed on absolute scale. Then, circularly averaged to produce absolute scale scattering intensity, I(q), as a function of the wave vector, q, where q ¼ (4p/l)sin(q/2) and q is the scattering angle. Calculations were performed using Igor Pro�software [30,31]. USANS experiments covered a q-range of 0.00005 < q (Å�1) < 0.01, corresponding to a real-space length scale of 0.1 microne10 micron.', '3. Results and discussions', '3.1. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 25 �C', 'SPTES copolymers have high proton conductivity at high relative humidities and elevated temperatures; e.g. 65 �C and 85% RH of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers, respectively [27]. The degree of sulfonation increases for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6%, respectively. SPTES-50 copolymer has the lowest the degree of sulfonation and SPTES-80 copolymer has the highest degree of sulfonation in this class of copolymers [22,27]. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers at 25 �C show a scattering behavior of a two phase structure (Fig. 2a). The contribution of sulfonic groups to the scattering is considered to be negligible due to their small volume compared to the polymer and the water phase volume. It was visually observed that membranes do not dissociate when fully hydrated in the examined temperature. It was also determined by weight measurement that the membranes maintain the weight after deswelling. Therefore, the hydrophobic polymeric structure is the supporting network even at high water content and increased temperatures. Fig. 2a presents enhanced scattering intensity data (vertically shifted) for the hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copol-ymer membranes in the order of 20X, 1000X, and 2 �105X for the clarity of data presentation. The absolute scale scattering intensities in the medium q range of 0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1 are almost in the same intensity range for all SPTES copolymers. The high q scattering spectra for all copolymers exhibit a feature which is attributed to the presence of ionic domains containing water molecules. According to the scattering results, the morphology of all hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C can be approximated as correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates with liquid-like ordering (P.Y. ordering) and a power law decay [29]. The scattering data for the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C were compared and quantified using polydisperse (Schulz polydispersity) hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [32e34] and a low q power law decay [29]. The modeling of the SPETS 50 nanostructure and its properties have been reported elsewhere but presented here for clarity and completeness of the SPTES series analysis [29]. Fig. 2b shows the experimental scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 25 �C compared with the theoretical calculations of the model (solid line). The results of the comparison of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes scattering data with the model are summarized in Table 1. According to this modeling the domain radius increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 13.45,14.9,15.4, and 16.9 Å for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes. The hard sphere packing density increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 19.8%, 23%, 25%, 29% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. This could indicate that ionic domains are capable of holding more water molecules with the presence of more sulfonic groups on the polymer backbone (increasing the degree of sulfonation). The high-q scattering spectra exhibits onset of a peak formation when the degree of sulfonation was increased to 71.6% for SPTES-80 copolymer. Pres-ence of scattering maxima can be due to the scattering from an ordered structure (periodicity) or the oscillations resulted from the structural factor effects or the excluded volume effect arising from short range liquid-like ordering. The onset of peak formation is attributed to the excluded volume effects related to the liquid-like ordering [33e35]. The low-q power law decay of nearly �3 was observed for all SPTES copolymers in the range of 1 �10�4 < q (1/ Å) < 3 �10�3. The power law decay of �3 is attributed to the presence of interacting three-dimensional fractal morphology. In addition, a Guinier plateau [35] was present for the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer at the very low q (q (1/Å) < 9 �10�5). This is in addition to the nearly identical scattering intensity in the inter-mediate q-range (0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1). It can be concluded that the change in the degree of sulfonation had little or no effect on the intermediate and low angle scattering wave vector. The low-q power law decay was nearly �3 �0.1 for all SPTES copolymers. The presence of sharp interface between hydrophobic and hydro-philic domains was deduced from the power law decay of �4 at large angle wave vectors for all hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes. All scattering data presented in Fig. 2a shows a power slope of �3.85 to �4.15 which is approximated as w �4. The presence of Porod behavior (decay of �4) has been attributed to the two immiscible phase with a sharp boundary [35e37]. This shows that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are separated with a distinct interface containing sulfonic groups.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Presence of a plateau in the scattering spectra is characteristics of isolated scatterers [35]. The radius of gyration (Rg) of the isolated scatterers can be approximated by IðqÞ ¼ I0expðð�q2R2gÞ=3Þ, where I0 is the extrapolated zero scattering intensity (Guinier approxi-mation) [35]. Presence of the Guinier plateau in the q range of 4.3 �10�5 < q (1/Å) < 8.2 �10�5 for SPTES-80 copolymer suggests segregation of the isolated large scale hydrophilic water pockets when the degree of sulfonation increased to 71.6%. Radius of gyration of the isolated larger scale water pockets in fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was 1.3 �0.18 micron which was calculated from this approximation (Fig. 2c).', '@', '@', '3.2. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 55 �C', 'Based on the physical observations, water saturated membranes at 55 �C were swollen films without visual dissociation. Fig. 3 exhibits the scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. The inter-mediate scattering intensity decreased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes start to form scattering maxima at high q range when the degree of sulfonation increased. This indicated the increase in the excluded volume due to the increase in the volume of the scatterers at higher degree of sulfonation and increased temperature (55 �C). The presence of scattering maxima is more significant for SPTES-70 copolymer and SPTES-80 copolymer with 63.3 and 71.6% degree of sulfonation. The large angle scattering feature shows scattering maxima at qmax of 0.103 and 0.1108 1/Å for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers which correspond to spatial characteristics lengths (l ¼ 2p/qmax) of 60.97 and 56.7 Å due to concentration fluctuations of hydrated domains (hard spheres). The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes changed significantlywith increasing degree of sulfonation. This indicates a substantial change in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology with increasing degree of sulfonation at 55 �C which is more pronounced for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers (degree of sulfonation 63.3 and 71.6%, respectively). Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are segregated distinctly by the sulfonic groups at the interface which is repre-sented by the Porod behavior, asymptotic behavior of w �4 for all SPTES copolymers [35e37]. The morphology of these membranes is complex and controlled by interfacial phenomena. The number of sulfonic groups per repeat unit volume and their acidity com-plemented with the chain persistent length and chain mobility are governing factors in the formed morphology. This study approxi-mates the morphology of the fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55 �C are approximated as spherical nanodomains containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering similar to their morphology at 25 �C. It is also proposed that this morphology changedtofractalmorphologywithincreasing temperature (increasing the intermediate scattering decay). The domain radius and the sphere packing density were increased from 26.4 Å and 28% for SPTES-50 copolymer to 32 Å and 33% for SPTES-60copolymerwhiletheintermediatescatteringintensity decreased. The domain radius and packing density of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane increased from 13.45 Å and 19.8% to 26.4 Å and 28% when the temperature increased from 25 �C to 55 �C with this approximation. The same increasing trend of 14.9 Åe32 Å for the average domain radius and 23%e33% of the sphere packing density was observed. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane compared to the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane is attributed to the disruption of the large scale morphology. The low q power law decay of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane was close to the decay of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane.', 'The increase in the degree of sulfonation of SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymers from 54.9, to 63.3 and 71.6% resulted in a shift in the position of the high q scattering maxima of the hydrated membranes toward the large angle scattering regime. This peak formation is more prominent for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copoly-mers with higher sulfonation degree. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering intensity in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers is attributed to the loss of the large scale water network, intermediate fractal morphology within the polymer and onset of a morphology change to a two large scale phase morphology. The closed domain morphology of polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with fractal network were present for fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55�C (Figs. 3 and 4a). However, substantialchangesinthemorphologyoffullyhydrated membranes occurred when the degree of sulfonation is increased to 63.3 and 71.6% for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers at higher temperature of 55 �C. Combination of high temperature, high density of sulfonic groups, and significant amount of water mole-cules within the polymer backbone could have resulted in the coalescence of the small spherical ionic domains and fractal water network into a larger scale bicontinuous network of intermeshed hydrophobic and hydrophilic morphology for fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane at 55 �C. The bicontinuous model origi-nally proposed for micro-emulsion of two immiscible phases of water and oil with comparable amount based on Landau theory [38,39]. This model describes two irregular shapes with distinct boundary and has been used for intermesh of hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure when the particle shape is not well-defined [40,41]. This model proposes I(q) ¼ (a2þc1q þ c2q2)�1 for a2 > 0, c1 < 0, and c2 > 0, a single broad scattering maxima, and power law decay of �4 at large scattering angles. Two characteristics lengths of d and x are deduced from this analysis having a2, c1, and c2[39,40], d is the domain periodicity or interdomain distance and x is the correlation length which has been attributed to the dispersion of d. According to this theory, c1 is negative due to the surfactant. The absolute values of c1 and the ratio of x/d should increase with increasing surfactant. The specific internal surface area can be derived from the ratio of S/V ¼ 44(1�4)/x [38,39].', 'The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane has a low-q upturn, a lower intermediate scattering intensity compared to the hydrated SPTES-60 and SPTES-50 copolymers, and a large angle maxima followed by a power law decay of �4. This indicates the onset of the coalescence of the ionic aggregates, disruption of the fractal water network, and the formation of the two irregular large scale bicontinuous phase morphology. The high q range (q > 0.037 1/Å) of the scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 55 �C was compared with the T.S. bicontinuous model (Fig. 4b). This simulation resulted in a periodicity, d, of 59.9 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima position, 60.97 Å. According to this simulation, the correlation length (x) is 31.14 Å. The medium-q range scattering still exhibits the larger scale morphology which is not completely converted to the bi-continuous phase morphology. However, they are partially collapsed characterized by a lower scattering intensity in the intermediate q range. The high q maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 is approximated as bicontinuous morphology. The low and medium q (q < 0.037 1/Å) scattering spectra of the SPTES 70 is due to the presence of fractal network of waters which have not coalesce yet.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The scattering spectra of the SPTES-80 copolymer are consistent with a bicontinuous two phase structure of irregular shapes with sulfonic groups as interfacial ionic region. The scattering experi-mental data of the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was compared with this model (q > 0.015 1/Å), (Fig. 4c and Table 2). The periodicity of the water domains (or hydrophobic domains), d, predicted by this model is w54 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima (qmax), 56.7 Å. This value is the distance between water domains. The correlation length (x) obtained from this model is 37.86 Å which is a measure of dispersion.', 'The distance between the water phases, periodicity, was decreased from 59.9 Å to 54 Å with increasing degree of sulfona-tion. The correlation length, x, was increased from 31.14 Å to 37.86 Å when the degree of sulfonation increased. Increasing the interfacial area results in an increase in the x/d ratio. The presence of the upturn in the low range of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 at 55 �C (Fig. 4b and c) is attributed to the fractal morphology of the large scale features.', '3.3. Discussions', 'Scattering data of series of SPTES membranes were obtained in the full hydration state with increasing the sulfonation degree in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. Complete study was performed to provide understanding membranes morphology with increasing the temperature of the hydrated membranes from 25 �C to 55 �C. Proposed model assumes spherical nanodomains containing water molecules forming from clustering of the sulfonation groups. This assumption was performed based on previously reported study which showed spherical nanodomains in the dry SPTES 50 membrane under HR-TEM [29]. The scattering spectra of the membranes with high degree of sulfonation (SPTES 70, and 80) changed significantly when the temperature increased to 55 �C. The morphology is approximated as bi-continuous system where the hydrocarbon is the main support network containing water. This model has been recently proposed by Wnek et al. [40], Gebel [8], and Kreuer [12], Wnek also provided visualization of the hydro-phobic cluster using SYBYL version 6.7 (Tripos) and HINT (Hydro-pathicINTeractions)computationalmodelingsoftware[40]. Despite the support of the transport studies of this model [42], there is no direct visualization method for this proposed approxi-mation. The T. S. model is also supported by high proton conduc-tivity of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 membranes at 55 �C where a larger number of hydronium ions in a larger domain can facilitate proton transport. A summary of the structural evolution of the SPTES membranes as a function of temperature and degree of sulfonation is illustrated in Table 3. This study attempted to study a full range of SPTES membrane nanostructure for the first time and provide an understanding of large membrane water uptakes, and their morphology and their relation with high conductivity of the membranes using both liquid like ordering of polydisperse nano-spheres and bi-continuous T.S. model approximation.', '@', '@', 'Table 3 Summary of membrane structural changes (SPTES 50, 60, 70, and 80 at 25 �C, and SPTES 50 and 60 at 55 �C) as a function of degree of sulfonation and temperature by polydisperse hard sphere model with liquid-like ordering ordering). T.S. bi-continuous model was approximated for higher sulfonation degree copolymers, SPTES 70 and 80, at 55 �C.', '@', '4. Conclusions', 'A series of SPTES copolymers with high proton conductivity of 100e215 mS/cm at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity as potential fuel cells membranes were studied. SANS studies of fully hydrated membranes showed that the nanostructure of the fully hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C in agreement with ionic aggregates containing water molecules with a large scale morphology network of water pockets morphology. This model predicted that the increase in the degree of sulfonation resulted in an increase in the radius of ionic domains and an increase in the volume packing density of water in the aggregates. It was assumed that the same morphology of polydisperse correlated spherical ionic domains were present in the SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymers when the temperature increased to 55 �C. Increase in the degree of sulfonation for fully hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer at 55 �C led to a substantial reorganization of the membrane morphology which was described by a bi-continuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic network.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to thank the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Nano-structured andBiological Materials Branch forfunding this research.

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25�C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 �C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 �10�4 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 �0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 �C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 �C).

All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through proton exchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Nafion�as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18].', 'Transport properties and nanostructure of sulfonated polyimide (SPI) membranes have been studied using pulsed field gradient NMR and NMR quadrupolar relaxation rates determinations [19,20], and small angle scattering methods (SAXS and SANS), respectively [21,22].', 'The microstructure of sulfonated polyetherether ketone (sPEEK) has been investigated by SAXS [12]. We recently reported a class of ionomers based on aromatic hydrocarbon copolymers with high proton conductivity and excellent thermal mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states [22e29]. Sulfonated poly-arylenethioethersulfone(SPTES)copolymershavefollowing chemical structures (Fig. 1).', 'SPTES copolymers including SPTES-50, SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80, have equivalent weight (EW) and IEC (mequiv./g) values of 610, 515, 459, 417, and 1.64, 1.94, 2.18, and 2.4, respectively [22]. They exhibited proton conductivity of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm respectively, at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity [22]. Their excellent proton conductivity at high temperatures combined with their high glass transition temperature (w200 �C) and mechanical stability (both in the dry and hydrated states) make them excellent potentials as high temperature PEM materials for fuel cells. SPTES-50 copolymer membrane has successfully been fabricated to membrane electrode assemblies and exhibited polarization curves and durability up to 400 h [29]. Their successful operations at 90e100 �C were limited by boiling point of water (100 �C at 1 atm). Replacing water molecules with heterocycles such as imidazolium where the charge carrier has a very low vapor pressure can result in proton conductivity at higher temperatures. Despite excellent electrochemical properties, excessive water uptake of SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes provide difficulties to be made as membrane electrode assembly [22,27] The proton transport and performance of SPTES copolymers highly depend on the presence of water molecules. In addition to the number of sulfonic groups, their acidity (pKa) ability to dissociate water molecules to proton, water activity coefficient, and number of water molecules associated with each sulfonic group, the supermolecular structure of the hydro-phobic and hydrophilic phases is also defined by polymer chain characteristics such as chain persistent length, and presence of sulfonic group on the backbone or in the side chains. We reported the presence of ionic nanodomains containing water molecules in the SPTES-70 using in-situ x-ray scattering [27]. The morphology and the nanostructure of SPTES-50 were approximated by corre-lated polydisperse spherical aggregates and a larger scale water domain network and were quantified by modeling of the SANS spectra with polydisperse hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [29]. This study reports the nanostructure and morphology of sulfonated polyarylenethioethersulfone (SPTES) copolymer membranes which is directly related to the proton transport through the membrane in terms of their degree of sulfonation and temperature dependency.', '2. Materials and methods', '2.1. Materials', 'Visually observed defect free films of SPTES copolymers were prepared by dissolving the purified copolymer in dimethyl acet-amide (DMAc, Sigma Aldrich) (5e10 wt%) filtering, placing in a flat dish in a vacuum oven with a gradual temperature rise to 100 �C for 24 h and 120 �C for 2 h. The resulting uniform flat films were immersed for 2 h in deionized water and dried under vacuum (24 h, 80 �C) after they were acidified in sulfuric acid (4 M, 24 h) to ensure complete conversion of sulfonic groups to their protonated forms.', '2.2. Characterization', 'SANS experiments were performed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Neutron Center for Research using 30 m NG-7 SANS instrument with a neutron wavelength, l, of 6 Å (Dl/l ¼ 10%) and three sample-to-detector distance of 1.5 m, 10 m (l ¼ 6 Å), and 15 m (l ¼ 8 Å), 0.001 < q < 0.3168 Å�1 at 25, and 55 �C (accuracy of 0.5 �C). Hydrated membranes were placed in demountable 1 mm thick titanium liquid cells filled with D2O after equilibrium in D2O (24 h). Scattered intensities were reduced, corrected for the transmission and background and placed on absolute scale. Then, circularly averaged to produce absolute scale scattering intensity, I(q), as a function of the wave vector, q, where q ¼ (4p/l)sin(q/2) and q is the scattering angle. Calculations were performed using Igor Pro�software [30,31]. USANS experiments covered a q-range of 0.00005 < q (Å�1) < 0.01, corresponding to a real-space length scale of 0.1 microne10 micron.', '3. Results and discussions', '3.1. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 25 �C', 'SPTES copolymers have high proton conductivity at high relative humidities and elevated temperatures; e.g. 65 �C and 85% RH of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers, respectively [27]. The degree of sulfonation increases for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6%, respectively. SPTES-50 copolymer has the lowest the degree of sulfonation and SPTES-80 copolymer has the highest degree of sulfonation in this class of copolymers [22,27]. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers at 25 �C show a scattering behavior of a two phase structure (Fig. 2a). The contribution of sulfonic groups to the scattering is considered to be negligible due to their small volume compared to the polymer and the water phase volume. It was visually observed that membranes do not dissociate when fully hydrated in the examined temperature. It was also determined by weight measurement that the membranes maintain the weight after deswelling. Therefore, the hydrophobic polymeric structure is the supporting network even at high water content and increased temperatures. Fig. 2a presents enhanced scattering intensity data (vertically shifted) for the hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copol-ymer membranes in the order of 20X, 1000X, and 2 �105X for the clarity of data presentation. The absolute scale scattering intensities in the medium q range of 0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1 are almost in the same intensity range for all SPTES copolymers. The high q scattering spectra for all copolymers exhibit a feature which is attributed to the presence of ionic domains containing water molecules. According to the scattering results, the morphology of all hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C can be approximated as correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates with liquid-like ordering (P.Y. ordering) and a power law decay [29]. The scattering data for the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C were compared and quantified using polydisperse (Schulz polydispersity) hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [32e34] and a low q power law decay [29]. The modeling of the SPETS 50 nanostructure and its properties have been reported elsewhere but presented here for clarity and completeness of the SPTES series analysis [29]. Fig. 2b shows the experimental scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 25 �C compared with the theoretical calculations of the model (solid line). The results of the comparison of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes scattering data with the model are summarized in Table 1. According to this modeling the domain radius increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 13.45,14.9,15.4, and 16.9 Å for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes. The hard sphere packing density increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 19.8%, 23%, 25%, 29% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. This could indicate that ionic domains are capable of holding more water molecules with the presence of more sulfonic groups on the polymer backbone (increasing the degree of sulfonation). The high-q scattering spectra exhibits onset of a peak formation when the degree of sulfonation was increased to 71.6% for SPTES-80 copolymer. Pres-ence of scattering maxima can be due to the scattering from an ordered structure (periodicity) or the oscillations resulted from the structural factor effects or the excluded volume effect arising from short range liquid-like ordering. The onset of peak formation is attributed to the excluded volume effects related to the liquid-like ordering [33e35]. The low-q power law decay of nearly �3 was observed for all SPTES copolymers in the range of 1 �10�4 < q (1/ Å) < 3 �10�3. The power law decay of �3 is attributed to the presence of interacting three-dimensional fractal morphology. In addition, a Guinier plateau [35] was present for the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer at the very low q (q (1/Å) < 9 �10�5). This is in addition to the nearly identical scattering intensity in the inter-mediate q-range (0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1). It can be concluded that the change in the degree of sulfonation had little or no effect on the intermediate and low angle scattering wave vector. The low-q power law decay was nearly �3 �0.1 for all SPTES copolymers. The presence of sharp interface between hydrophobic and hydro-philic domains was deduced from the power law decay of �4 at large angle wave vectors for all hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes. All scattering data presented in Fig. 2a shows a power slope of �3.85 to �4.15 which is approximated as w �4. The presence of Porod behavior (decay of �4) has been attributed to the two immiscible phase with a sharp boundary [35e37]. This shows that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are separated with a distinct interface containing sulfonic groups.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Presence of a plateau in the scattering spectra is characteristics of isolated scatterers [35]. The radius of gyration (Rg) of the isolated scatterers can be approximated by IðqÞ ¼ I0expðð�q2R2gÞ=3Þ, where I0 is the extrapolated zero scattering intensity (Guinier approxi-mation) [35]. Presence of the Guinier plateau in the q range of 4.3 �10�5 < q (1/Å) < 8.2 �10�5 for SPTES-80 copolymer suggests segregation of the isolated large scale hydrophilic water pockets when the degree of sulfonation increased to 71.6%. Radius of gyration of the isolated larger scale water pockets in fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was 1.3 �0.18 micron which was calculated from this approximation (Fig. 2c).', '@', '@', '3.2. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 55 �C', 'Based on the physical observations, water saturated membranes at 55 �C were swollen films without visual dissociation. Fig. 3 exhibits the scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. The inter-mediate scattering intensity decreased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes start to form scattering maxima at high q range when the degree of sulfonation increased. This indicated the increase in the excluded volume due to the increase in the volume of the scatterers at higher degree of sulfonation and increased temperature (55 �C). The presence of scattering maxima is more significant for SPTES-70 copolymer and SPTES-80 copolymer with 63.3 and 71.6% degree of sulfonation. The large angle scattering feature shows scattering maxima at qmax of 0.103 and 0.1108 1/Å for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers which correspond to spatial characteristics lengths (l ¼ 2p/qmax) of 60.97 and 56.7 Å due to concentration fluctuations of hydrated domains (hard spheres). The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes changed significantlywith increasing degree of sulfonation. This indicates a substantial change in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology with increasing degree of sulfonation at 55 �C which is more pronounced for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers (degree of sulfonation 63.3 and 71.6%, respectively). Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are segregated distinctly by the sulfonic groups at the interface which is repre-sented by the Porod behavior, asymptotic behavior of w �4 for all SPTES copolymers [35e37]. The morphology of these membranes is complex and controlled by interfacial phenomena. The number of sulfonic groups per repeat unit volume and their acidity com-plemented with the chain persistent length and chain mobility are governing factors in the formed morphology. This study approxi-mates the morphology of the fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55 �C are approximated as spherical nanodomains containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering similar to their morphology at 25 �C. It is also proposed that this morphology changedtofractalmorphologywithincreasing temperature (increasing the intermediate scattering decay). The domain radius and the sphere packing density were increased from 26.4 Å and 28% for SPTES-50 copolymer to 32 Å and 33% for SPTES-60copolymerwhiletheintermediatescatteringintensity decreased. The domain radius and packing density of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane increased from 13.45 Å and 19.8% to 26.4 Å and 28% when the temperature increased from 25 �C to 55 �C with this approximation. The same increasing trend of 14.9 Åe32 Å for the average domain radius and 23%e33% of the sphere packing density was observed. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane compared to the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane is attributed to the disruption of the large scale morphology. The low q power law decay of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane was close to the decay of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane.', 'The increase in the degree of sulfonation of SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymers from 54.9, to 63.3 and 71.6% resulted in a shift in the position of the high q scattering maxima of the hydrated membranes toward the large angle scattering regime. This peak formation is more prominent for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copoly-mers with higher sulfonation degree. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering intensity in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers is attributed to the loss of the large scale water network, intermediate fractal morphology within the polymer and onset of a morphology change to a two large scale phase morphology. The closed domain morphology of polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with fractal network were present for fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55�C (Figs. 3 and 4a). However, substantialchangesinthemorphologyoffullyhydrated membranes occurred when the degree of sulfonation is increased to 63.3 and 71.6% for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers at higher temperature of 55 �C. Combination of high temperature, high density of sulfonic groups, and significant amount of water mole-cules within the polymer backbone could have resulted in the coalescence of the small spherical ionic domains and fractal water network into a larger scale bicontinuous network of intermeshed hydrophobic and hydrophilic morphology for fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane at 55 �C. The bicontinuous model origi-nally proposed for micro-emulsion of two immiscible phases of water and oil with comparable amount based on Landau theory [38,39]. This model describes two irregular shapes with distinct boundary and has been used for intermesh of hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure when the particle shape is not well-defined [40,41]. This model proposes I(q) ¼ (a2þc1q þ c2q2)�1 for a2 > 0, c1 < 0, and c2 > 0, a single broad scattering maxima, and power law decay of �4 at large scattering angles. Two characteristics lengths of d and x are deduced from this analysis having a2, c1, and c2[39,40], d is the domain periodicity or interdomain distance and x is the correlation length which has been attributed to the dispersion of d. According to this theory, c1 is negative due to the surfactant. The absolute values of c1 and the ratio of x/d should increase with increasing surfactant. The specific internal surface area can be derived from the ratio of S/V ¼ 44(1�4)/x [38,39].', 'The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane has a low-q upturn, a lower intermediate scattering intensity compared to the hydrated SPTES-60 and SPTES-50 copolymers, and a large angle maxima followed by a power law decay of �4. This indicates the onset of the coalescence of the ionic aggregates, disruption of the fractal water network, and the formation of the two irregular large scale bicontinuous phase morphology. The high q range (q > 0.037 1/Å) of the scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 55 �C was compared with the T.S. bicontinuous model (Fig. 4b). This simulation resulted in a periodicity, d, of 59.9 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima position, 60.97 Å. According to this simulation, the correlation length (x) is 31.14 Å. The medium-q range scattering still exhibits the larger scale morphology which is not completely converted to the bi-continuous phase morphology. However, they are partially collapsed characterized by a lower scattering intensity in the intermediate q range. The high q maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 is approximated as bicontinuous morphology. The low and medium q (q < 0.037 1/Å) scattering spectra of the SPTES 70 is due to the presence of fractal network of waters which have not coalesce yet.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The scattering spectra of the SPTES-80 copolymer are consistent with a bicontinuous two phase structure of irregular shapes with sulfonic groups as interfacial ionic region. The scattering experi-mental data of the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was compared with this model (q > 0.015 1/Å), (Fig. 4c and Table 2). The periodicity of the water domains (or hydrophobic domains), d, predicted by this model is w54 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima (qmax), 56.7 Å. This value is the distance between water domains. The correlation length (x) obtained from this model is 37.86 Å which is a measure of dispersion.', 'The distance between the water phases, periodicity, was decreased from 59.9 Å to 54 Å with increasing degree of sulfona-tion. The correlation length, x, was increased from 31.14 Å to 37.86 Å when the degree of sulfonation increased. Increasing the interfacial area results in an increase in the x/d ratio. The presence of the upturn in the low range of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 at 55 �C (Fig. 4b and c) is attributed to the fractal morphology of the large scale features.', '3.3. Discussions', 'Scattering data of series of SPTES membranes were obtained in the full hydration state with increasing the sulfonation degree in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. Complete study was performed to provide understanding membranes morphology with increasing the temperature of the hydrated membranes from 25 �C to 55 �C. Proposed model assumes spherical nanodomains containing water molecules forming from clustering of the sulfonation groups. This assumption was performed based on previously reported study which showed spherical nanodomains in the dry SPTES 50 membrane under HR-TEM [29]. The scattering spectra of the membranes with high degree of sulfonation (SPTES 70, and 80) changed significantly when the temperature increased to 55 �C. The morphology is approximated as bi-continuous system where the hydrocarbon is the main support network containing water. This model has been recently proposed by Wnek et al. [40], Gebel [8], and Kreuer [12], Wnek also provided visualization of the hydro-phobic cluster using SYBYL version 6.7 (Tripos) and HINT (Hydro-pathicINTeractions)computationalmodelingsoftware[40]. Despite the support of the transport studies of this model [42], there is no direct visualization method for this proposed approxi-mation. The T. S. model is also supported by high proton conduc-tivity of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 membranes at 55 �C where a larger number of hydronium ions in a larger domain can facilitate proton transport. A summary of the structural evolution of the SPTES membranes as a function of temperature and degree of sulfonation is illustrated in Table 3. This study attempted to study a full range of SPTES membrane nanostructure for the first time and provide an understanding of large membrane water uptakes, and their morphology and their relation with high conductivity of the membranes using both liquid like ordering of polydisperse nano-spheres and bi-continuous T.S. model approximation.', '@', '@', 'Table 3 Summary of membrane structural changes (SPTES 50, 60, 70, and 80 at 25 �C, and SPTES 50 and 60 at 55 �C) as a function of degree of sulfonation and temperature by polydisperse hard sphere model with liquid-like ordering ordering). T.S. bi-continuous model was approximated for higher sulfonation degree copolymers, SPTES 70 and 80, at 55 �C.', '@', '4. Conclusions', 'A series of SPTES copolymers with high proton conductivity of 100e215 mS/cm at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity as potential fuel cells membranes were studied. SANS studies of fully hydrated membranes showed that the nanostructure of the fully hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C in agreement with ionic aggregates containing water molecules with a large scale morphology network of water pockets morphology. This model predicted that the increase in the degree of sulfonation resulted in an increase in the radius of ionic domains and an increase in the volume packing density of water in the aggregates. It was assumed that the same morphology of polydisperse correlated spherical ionic domains were present in the SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymers when the temperature increased to 55 �C. Increase in the degree of sulfonation for fully hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer at 55 �C led to a substantial reorganization of the membrane morphology which was described by a bi-continuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic network.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to thank the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Nano-structured andBiological Materials Branch forfunding this research.

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25�C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 �C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 �10�4 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 �0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 �C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 �C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by significant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of �4 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers.', '�2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through proton exchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Nafion�as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18].', 'Transport properties and nanostructure of sulfonated polyimide (SPI) membranes have been studied using pulsed field gradient NMR and NMR quadrupolar relaxation rates determinations [19,20], and small angle scattering methods (SAXS and SANS), respectively [21,22].', 'The microstructure of sulfonated polyetherether ketone (sPEEK) has been investigated by SAXS [12]. We recently reported a class of ionomers based on aromatic hydrocarbon copolymers with high proton conductivity and excellent thermal mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states [22e29]. Sulfonated poly-arylenethioethersulfone(SPTES)copolymershavefollowing chemical structures (Fig. 1).', 'SPTES copolymers including SPTES-50, SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80, have equivalent weight (EW) and IEC (mequiv./g) values of 610, 515, 459, 417, and 1.64, 1.94, 2.18, and 2.4, respectively [22]. They exhibited proton conductivity of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm respectively, at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity [22]. Their excellent proton conductivity at high temperatures combined with their high glass transition temperature (w200 �C) and mechanical stability (both in the dry and hydrated states) make them excellent potentials as high temperature PEM materials for fuel cells. SPTES-50 copolymer membrane has successfully been fabricated to membrane electrode assemblies and exhibited polarization curves and durability up to 400 h [29]. Their successful operations at 90e100 �C were limited by boiling point of water (100 �C at 1 atm). Replacing water molecules with heterocycles such as imidazolium where the charge carrier has a very low vapor pressure can result in proton conductivity at higher temperatures. Despite excellent electrochemical properties, excessive water uptake of SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes provide difficulties to be made as membrane electrode assembly [22,27] The proton transport and performance of SPTES copolymers highly depend on the presence of water molecules. In addition to the number of sulfonic groups, their acidity (pKa) ability to dissociate water molecules to proton, water activity coefficient, and number of water molecules associated with each sulfonic group, the supermolecular structure of the hydro-phobic and hydrophilic phases is also defined by polymer chain characteristics such as chain persistent length, and presence of sulfonic group on the backbone or in the side chains. We reported the presence of ionic nanodomains containing water molecules in the SPTES-70 using in-situ x-ray scattering [27]. The morphology and the nanostructure of SPTES-50 were approximated by corre-lated polydisperse spherical aggregates and a larger scale water domain network and were quantified by modeling of the SANS spectra with polydisperse hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [29]. This study reports the nanostructure and morphology of sulfonated polyarylenethioethersulfone (SPTES) copolymer membranes which is directly related to the proton transport through the membrane in terms of their degree of sulfonation and temperature dependency.', '2. Materials and methods', '2.1. Materials', 'Visually observed defect free films of SPTES copolymers were prepared by dissolving the purified copolymer in dimethyl acet-amide (DMAc, Sigma Aldrich) (5e10 wt%) filtering, placing in a flat dish in a vacuum oven with a gradual temperature rise to 100 �C for 24 h and 120 �C for 2 h. The resulting uniform flat films were immersed for 2 h in deionized water and dried under vacuum (24 h, 80 �C) after they were acidified in sulfuric acid (4 M, 24 h) to ensure complete conversion of sulfonic groups to their protonated forms.', '2.2. Characterization', 'SANS experiments were performed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Neutron Center for Research using 30 m NG-7 SANS instrument with a neutron wavelength, l, of 6 Å (Dl/l ¼ 10%) and three sample-to-detector distance of 1.5 m, 10 m (l ¼ 6 Å), and 15 m (l ¼ 8 Å), 0.001 < q < 0.3168 Å�1 at 25, and 55 �C (accuracy of 0.5 �C). Hydrated membranes were placed in demountable 1 mm thick titanium liquid cells filled with D2O after equilibrium in D2O (24 h). Scattered intensities were reduced, corrected for the transmission and background and placed on absolute scale. Then, circularly averaged to produce absolute scale scattering intensity, I(q), as a function of the wave vector, q, where q ¼ (4p/l)sin(q/2) and q is the scattering angle. Calculations were performed using Igor Pro�software [30,31]. USANS experiments covered a q-range of 0.00005 < q (Å�1) < 0.01, corresponding to a real-space length scale of 0.1 microne10 micron.', '3. Results and discussions', '3.1. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 25 �C', 'SPTES copolymers have high proton conductivity at high relative humidities and elevated temperatures; e.g. 65 �C and 85% RH of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers, respectively [27]. The degree of sulfonation increases for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6%, respectively. SPTES-50 copolymer has the lowest the degree of sulfonation and SPTES-80 copolymer has the highest degree of sulfonation in this class of copolymers [22,27]. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers at 25 �C show a scattering behavior of a two phase structure (Fig. 2a). The contribution of sulfonic groups to the scattering is considered to be negligible due to their small volume compared to the polymer and the water phase volume. It was visually observed that membranes do not dissociate when fully hydrated in the examined temperature. It was also determined by weight measurement that the membranes maintain the weight after deswelling. Therefore, the hydrophobic polymeric structure is the supporting network even at high water content and increased temperatures. Fig. 2a presents enhanced scattering intensity data (vertically shifted) for the hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copol-ymer membranes in the order of 20X, 1000X, and 2 �105X for the clarity of data presentation. The absolute scale scattering intensities in the medium q range of 0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1 are almost in the same intensity range for all SPTES copolymers. The high q scattering spectra for all copolymers exhibit a feature which is attributed to the presence of ionic domains containing water molecules. According to the scattering results, the morphology of all hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C can be approximated as correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates with liquid-like ordering (P.Y. ordering) and a power law decay [29]. The scattering data for the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C were compared and quantified using polydisperse (Schulz polydispersity) hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [32e34] and a low q power law decay [29]. The modeling of the SPETS 50 nanostructure and its properties have been reported elsewhere but presented here for clarity and completeness of the SPTES series analysis [29]. Fig. 2b shows the experimental scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 25 �C compared with the theoretical calculations of the model (solid line). The results of the comparison of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes scattering data with the model are summarized in Table 1. According to this modeling the domain radius increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 13.45,14.9,15.4, and 16.9 Å for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes. The hard sphere packing density increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 19.8%, 23%, 25%, 29% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. This could indicate that ionic domains are capable of holding more water molecules with the presence of more sulfonic groups on the polymer backbone (increasing the degree of sulfonation). The high-q scattering spectra exhibits onset of a peak formation when the degree of sulfonation was increased to 71.6% for SPTES-80 copolymer. Pres-ence of scattering maxima can be due to the scattering from an ordered structure (periodicity) or the oscillations resulted from the structural factor effects or the excluded volume effect arising from short range liquid-like ordering. The onset of peak formation is attributed to the excluded volume effects related to the liquid-like ordering [33e35]. The low-q power law decay of nearly �3 was observed for all SPTES copolymers in the range of 1 �10�4 < q (1/ Å) < 3 �10�3. The power law decay of �3 is attributed to the presence of interacting three-dimensional fractal morphology. In addition, a Guinier plateau [35] was present for the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer at the very low q (q (1/Å) < 9 �10�5). This is in addition to the nearly identical scattering intensity in the inter-mediate q-range (0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1). It can be concluded that the change in the degree of sulfonation had little or no effect on the intermediate and low angle scattering wave vector. The low-q power law decay was nearly �3 �0.1 for all SPTES copolymers. The presence of sharp interface between hydrophobic and hydro-philic domains was deduced from the power law decay of �4 at large angle wave vectors for all hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes. All scattering data presented in Fig. 2a shows a power slope of �3.85 to �4.15 which is approximated as w �4. The presence of Porod behavior (decay of �4) has been attributed to the two immiscible phase with a sharp boundary [35e37]. This shows that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are separated with a distinct interface containing sulfonic groups.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Presence of a plateau in the scattering spectra is characteristics of isolated scatterers [35]. The radius of gyration (Rg) of the isolated scatterers can be approximated by IðqÞ ¼ I0expðð�q2R2gÞ=3Þ, where I0 is the extrapolated zero scattering intensity (Guinier approxi-mation) [35]. Presence of the Guinier plateau in the q range of 4.3 �10�5 < q (1/Å) < 8.2 �10�5 for SPTES-80 copolymer suggests segregation of the isolated large scale hydrophilic water pockets when the degree of sulfonation increased to 71.6%. Radius of gyration of the isolated larger scale water pockets in fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was 1.3 �0.18 micron which was calculated from this approximation (Fig. 2c).', '@', '@', '3.2. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 55 �C', 'Based on the physical observations, water saturated membranes at 55 �C were swollen films without visual dissociation. Fig. 3 exhibits the scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. The inter-mediate scattering intensity decreased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes start to form scattering maxima at high q range when the degree of sulfonation increased. This indicated the increase in the excluded volume due to the increase in the volume of the scatterers at higher degree of sulfonation and increased temperature (55 �C). The presence of scattering maxima is more significant for SPTES-70 copolymer and SPTES-80 copolymer with 63.3 and 71.6% degree of sulfonation. The large angle scattering feature shows scattering maxima at qmax of 0.103 and 0.1108 1/Å for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers which correspond to spatial characteristics lengths (l ¼ 2p/qmax) of 60.97 and 56.7 Å due to concentration fluctuations of hydrated domains (hard spheres). The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes changed significantlywith increasing degree of sulfonation. This indicates a substantial change in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology with increasing degree of sulfonation at 55 �C which is more pronounced for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers (degree of sulfonation 63.3 and 71.6%, respectively). Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are segregated distinctly by the sulfonic groups at the interface which is repre-sented by the Porod behavior, asymptotic behavior of w �4 for all SPTES copolymers [35e37]. The morphology of these membranes is complex and controlled by interfacial phenomena. The number of sulfonic groups per repeat unit volume and their acidity com-plemented with the chain persistent length and chain mobility are governing factors in the formed morphology. This study approxi-mates the morphology of the fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55 �C are approximated as spherical nanodomains containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering similar to their morphology at 25 �C. It is also proposed that this morphology changedtofractalmorphologywithincreasing temperature (increasing the intermediate scattering decay). The domain radius and the sphere packing density were increased from 26.4 Å and 28% for SPTES-50 copolymer to 32 Å and 33% for SPTES-60copolymerwhiletheintermediatescatteringintensity decreased. The domain radius and packing density of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane increased from 13.45 Å and 19.8% to 26.4 Å and 28% when the temperature increased from 25 �C to 55 �C with this approximation. The same increasing trend of 14.9 Åe32 Å for the average domain radius and 23%e33% of the sphere packing density was observed. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane compared to the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane is attributed to the disruption of the large scale morphology. The low q power law decay of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane was close to the decay of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane.', 'The increase in the degree of sulfonation of SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymers from 54.9, to 63.3 and 71.6% resulted in a shift in the position of the high q scattering maxima of the hydrated membranes toward the large angle scattering regime. This peak formation is more prominent for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copoly-mers with higher sulfonation degree. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering intensity in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers is attributed to the loss of the large scale water network, intermediate fractal morphology within the polymer and onset of a morphology change to a two large scale phase morphology. The closed domain morphology of polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with fractal network were present for fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55�C (Figs. 3 and 4a). However, substantialchangesinthemorphologyoffullyhydrated membranes occurred when the degree of sulfonation is increased to 63.3 and 71.6% for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers at higher temperature of 55 �C. Combination of high temperature, high density of sulfonic groups, and significant amount of water mole-cules within the polymer backbone could have resulted in the coalescence of the small spherical ionic domains and fractal water network into a larger scale bicontinuous network of intermeshed hydrophobic and hydrophilic morphology for fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane at 55 �C. The bicontinuous model origi-nally proposed for micro-emulsion of two immiscible phases of water and oil with comparable amount based on Landau theory [38,39]. This model describes two irregular shapes with distinct boundary and has been used for intermesh of hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure when the particle shape is not well-defined [40,41]. This model proposes I(q) ¼ (a2þc1q þ c2q2)�1 for a2 > 0, c1 < 0, and c2 > 0, a single broad scattering maxima, and power law decay of �4 at large scattering angles. Two characteristics lengths of d and x are deduced from this analysis having a2, c1, and c2[39,40], d is the domain periodicity or interdomain distance and x is the correlation length which has been attributed to the dispersion of d. According to this theory, c1 is negative due to the surfactant. The absolute values of c1 and the ratio of x/d should increase with increasing surfactant. The specific internal surface area can be derived from the ratio of S/V ¼ 44(1�4)/x [38,39].', 'The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane has a low-q upturn, a lower intermediate scattering intensity compared to the hydrated SPTES-60 and SPTES-50 copolymers, and a large angle maxima followed by a power law decay of �4. This indicates the onset of the coalescence of the ionic aggregates, disruption of the fractal water network, and the formation of the two irregular large scale bicontinuous phase morphology. The high q range (q > 0.037 1/Å) of the scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 55 �C was compared with the T.S. bicontinuous model (Fig. 4b). This simulation resulted in a periodicity, d, of 59.9 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima position, 60.97 Å. According to this simulation, the correlation length (x) is 31.14 Å. The medium-q range scattering still exhibits the larger scale morphology which is not completely converted to the bi-continuous phase morphology. However, they are partially collapsed characterized by a lower scattering intensity in the intermediate q range. The high q maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 is approximated as bicontinuous morphology. The low and medium q (q < 0.037 1/Å) scattering spectra of the SPTES 70 is due to the presence of fractal network of waters which have not coalesce yet.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The scattering spectra of the SPTES-80 copolymer are consistent with a bicontinuous two phase structure of irregular shapes with sulfonic groups as interfacial ionic region. The scattering experi-mental data of the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was compared with this model (q > 0.015 1/Å), (Fig. 4c and Table 2). The periodicity of the water domains (or hydrophobic domains), d, predicted by this model is w54 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima (qmax), 56.7 Å. This value is the distance between water domains. The correlation length (x) obtained from this model is 37.86 Å which is a measure of dispersion.', 'The distance between the water phases, periodicity, was decreased from 59.9 Å to 54 Å with increasing degree of sulfona-tion. The correlation length, x, was increased from 31.14 Å to 37.86 Å when the degree of sulfonation increased. Increasing the interfacial area results in an increase in the x/d ratio. The presence of the upturn in the low range of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 at 55 �C (Fig. 4b and c) is attributed to the fractal morphology of the large scale features.', '3.3. Discussions', 'Scattering data of series of SPTES membranes were obtained in the full hydration state with increasing the sulfonation degree in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. Complete study was performed to provide understanding membranes morphology with increasing the temperature of the hydrated membranes from 25 �C to 55 �C. Proposed model assumes spherical nanodomains containing water molecules forming from clustering of the sulfonation groups. This assumption was performed based on previously reported study which showed spherical nanodomains in the dry SPTES 50 membrane under HR-TEM [29]. The scattering spectra of the membranes with high degree of sulfonation (SPTES 70, and 80) changed significantly when the temperature increased to 55 �C. The morphology is approximated as bi-continuous system where the hydrocarbon is the main support network containing water. This model has been recently proposed by Wnek et al. [40], Gebel [8], and Kreuer [12], Wnek also provided visualization of the hydro-phobic cluster using SYBYL version 6.7 (Tripos) and HINT (Hydro-pathicINTeractions)computationalmodelingsoftware[40]. Despite the support of the transport studies of this model [42], there is no direct visualization method for this proposed approxi-mation. The T. S. model is also supported by high proton conduc-tivity of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 membranes at 55 �C where a larger number of hydronium ions in a larger domain can facilitate proton transport. A summary of the structural evolution of the SPTES membranes as a function of temperature and degree of sulfonation is illustrated in Table 3. This study attempted to study a full range of SPTES membrane nanostructure for the first time and provide an understanding of large membrane water uptakes, and their morphology and their relation with high conductivity of the membranes using both liquid like ordering of polydisperse nano-spheres and bi-continuous T.S. model approximation.', '@', '@', 'Table 3 Summary of membrane structural changes (SPTES 50, 60, 70, and 80 at 25 �C, and SPTES 50 and 60 at 55 �C) as a function of degree of sulfonation and temperature by polydisperse hard sphere model with liquid-like ordering ordering). T.S. bi-continuous model was approximated for higher sulfonation degree copolymers, SPTES 70 and 80, at 55 �C.', '@', '4. Conclusions', 'A series of SPTES copolymers with high proton conductivity of 100e215 mS/cm at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity as potential fuel cells membranes were studied. SANS studies of fully hydrated membranes showed that the nanostructure of the fully hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C in agreement with ionic aggregates containing water molecules with a large scale morphology network of water pockets morphology. This model predicted that the increase in the degree of sulfonation resulted in an increase in the radius of ionic domains and an increase in the volume packing density of water in the aggregates. It was assumed that the same morphology of polydisperse correlated spherical ionic domains were present in the SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymers when the temperature increased to 55 �C. Increase in the degree of sulfonation for fully hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer at 55 �C led to a substantial reorganization of the membrane morphology which was described by a bi-continuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic network.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to thank the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Nano-structured andBiological Materials Branch forfunding this research.

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25�C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 �C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 �10�4 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 �0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 �C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 �C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by significant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of �4 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers.', '�2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through proton exchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Nafion�as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18].', 'Transport properties and nanostructure of sulfonated polyimide (SPI) membranes have been studied using pulsed field gradient NMR and NMR quadrupolar relaxation rates determinations [19,20], and small angle scattering methods (SAXS and SANS), respectively [21,22].', 'The microstructure of sulfonated polyetherether ketone (sPEEK) has been investigated by SAXS [12]. We recently reported a class of ionomers based on aromatic hydrocarbon copolymers with high proton conductivity and excellent thermal mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states [22e29]. Sulfonated poly-arylenethioethersulfone(SPTES)copolymershavefollowing chemical structures (Fig. 1).', 'SPTES copolymers including SPTES-50, SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80, have equivalent weight (EW) and IEC (mequiv./g) values of 610, 515, 459, 417, and 1.64, 1.94, 2.18, and 2.4, respectively [22]. They exhibited proton conductivity of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm respectively, at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity [22]. Their excellent proton conductivity at high temperatures combined with their high glass transition temperature (w200 �C) and mechanical stability (both in the dry and hydrated states) make them excellent potentials as high temperature PEM materials for fuel cells. SPTES-50 copolymer membrane has successfully been fabricated to membrane electrode assemblies and exhibited polarization curves and durability up to 400 h [29]. Their successful operations at 90e100 �C were limited by boiling point of water (100 �C at 1 atm). Replacing water molecules with heterocycles such as imidazolium where the charge carrier has a very low vapor pressure can result in proton conductivity at higher temperatures. Despite excellent electrochemical properties, excessive water uptake of SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes provide difficulties to be made as membrane electrode assembly [22,27] The proton transport and performance of SPTES copolymers highly depend on the presence of water molecules. In addition to the number of sulfonic groups, their acidity (pKa) ability to dissociate water molecules to proton, water activity coefficient, and number of water molecules associated with each sulfonic group, the supermolecular structure of the hydro-phobic and hydrophilic phases is also defined by polymer chain characteristics such as chain persistent length, and presence of sulfonic group on the backbone or in the side chains. We reported the presence of ionic nanodomains containing water molecules in the SPTES-70 using in-situ x-ray scattering [27]. The morphology and the nanostructure of SPTES-50 were approximated by corre-lated polydisperse spherical aggregates and a larger scale water domain network and were quantified by modeling of the SANS spectra with polydisperse hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [29]. This study reports the nanostructure and morphology of sulfonated polyarylenethioethersulfone (SPTES) copolymer membranes which is directly related to the proton transport through the membrane in terms of their degree of sulfonation and temperature dependency.', '2. Materials and methods', '2.1. Materials', 'Visually observed defect free films of SPTES copolymers were prepared by dissolving the purified copolymer in dimethyl acet-amide (DMAc, Sigma Aldrich) (5e10 wt%) filtering, placing in a flat dish in a vacuum oven with a gradual temperature rise to 100 �C for 24 h and 120 �C for 2 h. The resulting uniform flat films were immersed for 2 h in deionized water and dried under vacuum (24 h, 80 �C) after they were acidified in sulfuric acid (4 M, 24 h) to ensure complete conversion of sulfonic groups to their protonated forms.', '2.2. Characterization', 'SANS experiments were performed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Neutron Center for Research using 30 m NG-7 SANS instrument with a neutron wavelength, l, of 6 Å (Dl/l ¼ 10%) and three sample-to-detector distance of 1.5 m, 10 m (l ¼ 6 Å), and 15 m (l ¼ 8 Å), 0.001 < q < 0.3168 Å�1 at 25, and 55 �C (accuracy of 0.5 �C). Hydrated membranes were placed in demountable 1 mm thick titanium liquid cells filled with D2O after equilibrium in D2O (24 h). Scattered intensities were reduced, corrected for the transmission and background and placed on absolute scale. Then, circularly averaged to produce absolute scale scattering intensity, I(q), as a function of the wave vector, q, where q ¼ (4p/l)sin(q/2) and q is the scattering angle. Calculations were performed using Igor Pro�software [30,31]. USANS experiments covered a q-range of 0.00005 < q (Å�1) < 0.01, corresponding to a real-space length scale of 0.1 microne10 micron.', '3. Results and discussions', '3.1. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 25 �C', 'SPTES copolymers have high proton conductivity at high relative humidities and elevated temperatures; e.g. 65 �C and 85% RH of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers, respectively [27]. The degree of sulfonation increases for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6%, respectively. SPTES-50 copolymer has the lowest the degree of sulfonation and SPTES-80 copolymer has the highest degree of sulfonation in this class of copolymers [22,27]. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers at 25 �C show a scattering behavior of a two phase structure (Fig. 2a). The contribution of sulfonic groups to the scattering is considered to be negligible due to their small volume compared to the polymer and the water phase volume. It was visually observed that membranes do not dissociate when fully hydrated in the examined temperature. It was also determined by weight measurement that the membranes maintain the weight after deswelling. Therefore, the hydrophobic polymeric structure is the supporting network even at high water content and increased temperatures. Fig. 2a presents enhanced scattering intensity data (vertically shifted) for the hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copol-ymer membranes in the order of 20X, 1000X, and 2 �105X for the clarity of data presentation. The absolute scale scattering intensities in the medium q range of 0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1 are almost in the same intensity range for all SPTES copolymers. The high q scattering spectra for all copolymers exhibit a feature which is attributed to the presence of ionic domains containing water molecules. According to the scattering results, the morphology of all hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C can be approximated as correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates with liquid-like ordering (P.Y. ordering) and a power law decay [29]. The scattering data for the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C were compared and quantified using polydisperse (Schulz polydispersity) hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [32e34] and a low q power law decay [29]. The modeling of the SPETS 50 nanostructure and its properties have been reported elsewhere but presented here for clarity and completeness of the SPTES series analysis [29]. Fig. 2b shows the experimental scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 25 �C compared with the theoretical calculations of the model (solid line). The results of the comparison of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes scattering data with the model are summarized in Table 1. According to this modeling the domain radius increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 13.45,14.9,15.4, and 16.9 Å for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes. The hard sphere packing density increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 19.8%, 23%, 25%, 29% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. This could indicate that ionic domains are capable of holding more water molecules with the presence of more sulfonic groups on the polymer backbone (increasing the degree of sulfonation). The high-q scattering spectra exhibits onset of a peak formation when the degree of sulfonation was increased to 71.6% for SPTES-80 copolymer. Pres-ence of scattering maxima can be due to the scattering from an ordered structure (periodicity) or the oscillations resulted from the structural factor effects or the excluded volume effect arising from short range liquid-like ordering. The onset of peak formation is attributed to the excluded volume effects related to the liquid-like ordering [33e35]. The low-q power law decay of nearly �3 was observed for all SPTES copolymers in the range of 1 �10�4 < q (1/ Å) < 3 �10�3. The power law decay of �3 is attributed to the presence of interacting three-dimensional fractal morphology. In addition, a Guinier plateau [35] was present for the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer at the very low q (q (1/Å) < 9 �10�5). This is in addition to the nearly identical scattering intensity in the inter-mediate q-range (0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1). It can be concluded that the change in the degree of sulfonation had little or no effect on the intermediate and low angle scattering wave vector. The low-q power law decay was nearly �3 �0.1 for all SPTES copolymers. The presence of sharp interface between hydrophobic and hydro-philic domains was deduced from the power law decay of �4 at large angle wave vectors for all hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes. All scattering data presented in Fig. 2a shows a power slope of �3.85 to �4.15 which is approximated as w �4. The presence of Porod behavior (decay of �4) has been attributed to the two immiscible phase with a sharp boundary [35e37]. This shows that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are separated with a distinct interface containing sulfonic groups.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Presence of a plateau in the scattering spectra is characteristics of isolated scatterers [35]. The radius of gyration (Rg) of the isolated scatterers can be approximated by IðqÞ ¼ I0expðð�q2R2gÞ=3Þ, where I0 is the extrapolated zero scattering intensity (Guinier approxi-mation) [35]. Presence of the Guinier plateau in the q range of 4.3 �10�5 < q (1/Å) < 8.2 �10�5 for SPTES-80 copolymer suggests segregation of the isolated large scale hydrophilic water pockets when the degree of sulfonation increased to 71.6%. Radius of gyration of the isolated larger scale water pockets in fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was 1.3 �0.18 micron which was calculated from this approximation (Fig. 2c).', '@', '@', '3.2. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 55 �C', 'Based on the physical observations, water saturated membranes at 55 �C were swollen films without visual dissociation. Fig. 3 exhibits the scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. The inter-mediate scattering intensity decreased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes start to form scattering maxima at high q range when the degree of sulfonation increased. This indicated the increase in the excluded volume due to the increase in the volume of the scatterers at higher degree of sulfonation and increased temperature (55 �C). The presence of scattering maxima is more significant for SPTES-70 copolymer and SPTES-80 copolymer with 63.3 and 71.6% degree of sulfonation. The large angle scattering feature shows scattering maxima at qmax of 0.103 and 0.1108 1/Å for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers which correspond to spatial characteristics lengths (l ¼ 2p/qmax) of 60.97 and 56.7 Å due to concentration fluctuations of hydrated domains (hard spheres). The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes changed significantlywith increasing degree of sulfonation. This indicates a substantial change in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology with increasing degree of sulfonation at 55 �C which is more pronounced for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers (degree of sulfonation 63.3 and 71.6%, respectively). Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are segregated distinctly by the sulfonic groups at the interface which is repre-sented by the Porod behavior, asymptotic behavior of w �4 for all SPTES copolymers [35e37]. The morphology of these membranes is complex and controlled by interfacial phenomena. The number of sulfonic groups per repeat unit volume and their acidity com-plemented with the chain persistent length and chain mobility are governing factors in the formed morphology. This study approxi-mates the morphology of the fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55 �C are approximated as spherical nanodomains containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering similar to their morphology at 25 �C. It is also proposed that this morphology changedtofractalmorphologywithincreasing temperature (increasing the intermediate scattering decay). The domain radius and the sphere packing density were increased from 26.4 Å and 28% for SPTES-50 copolymer to 32 Å and 33% for SPTES-60copolymerwhiletheintermediatescatteringintensity decreased. The domain radius and packing density of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane increased from 13.45 Å and 19.8% to 26.4 Å and 28% when the temperature increased from 25 �C to 55 �C with this approximation. The same increasing trend of 14.9 Åe32 Å for the average domain radius and 23%e33% of the sphere packing density was observed. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane compared to the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane is attributed to the disruption of the large scale morphology. The low q power law decay of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane was close to the decay of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane.', 'The increase in the degree of sulfonation of SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymers from 54.9, to 63.3 and 71.6% resulted in a shift in the position of the high q scattering maxima of the hydrated membranes toward the large angle scattering regime. This peak formation is more prominent for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copoly-mers with higher sulfonation degree. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering intensity in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers is attributed to the loss of the large scale water network, intermediate fractal morphology within the polymer and onset of a morphology change to a two large scale phase morphology. The closed domain morphology of polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with fractal network were present for fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55�C (Figs. 3 and 4a). However, substantialchangesinthemorphologyoffullyhydrated membranes occurred when the degree of sulfonation is increased to 63.3 and 71.6% for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers at higher temperature of 55 �C. Combination of high temperature, high density of sulfonic groups, and significant amount of water mole-cules within the polymer backbone could have resulted in the coalescence of the small spherical ionic domains and fractal water network into a larger scale bicontinuous network of intermeshed hydrophobic and hydrophilic morphology for fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane at 55 �C. The bicontinuous model origi-nally proposed for micro-emulsion of two immiscible phases of water and oil with comparable amount based on Landau theory [38,39]. This model describes two irregular shapes with distinct boundary and has been used for intermesh of hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure when the particle shape is not well-defined [40,41]. This model proposes I(q) ¼ (a2þc1q þ c2q2)�1 for a2 > 0, c1 < 0, and c2 > 0, a single broad scattering maxima, and power law decay of �4 at large scattering angles. Two characteristics lengths of d and x are deduced from this analysis having a2, c1, and c2[39,40], d is the domain periodicity or interdomain distance and x is the correlation length which has been attributed to the dispersion of d. According to this theory, c1 is negative due to the surfactant. The absolute values of c1 and the ratio of x/d should increase with increasing surfactant. The specific internal surface area can be derived from the ratio of S/V ¼ 44(1�4)/x [38,39].', 'The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane has a low-q upturn, a lower intermediate scattering intensity compared to the hydrated SPTES-60 and SPTES-50 copolymers, and a large angle maxima followed by a power law decay of �4. This indicates the onset of the coalescence of the ionic aggregates, disruption of the fractal water network, and the formation of the two irregular large scale bicontinuous phase morphology. The high q range (q > 0.037 1/Å) of the scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 55 �C was compared with the T.S. bicontinuous model (Fig. 4b). This simulation resulted in a periodicity, d, of 59.9 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima position, 60.97 Å. According to this simulation, the correlation length (x) is 31.14 Å. The medium-q range scattering still exhibits the larger scale morphology which is not completely converted to the bi-continuous phase morphology. However, they are partially collapsed characterized by a lower scattering intensity in the intermediate q range. The high q maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 is approximated as bicontinuous morphology. The low and medium q (q < 0.037 1/Å) scattering spectra of the SPTES 70 is due to the presence of fractal network of waters which have not coalesce yet.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The scattering spectra of the SPTES-80 copolymer are consistent with a bicontinuous two phase structure of irregular shapes with sulfonic groups as interfacial ionic region. The scattering experi-mental data of the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was compared with this model (q > 0.015 1/Å), (Fig. 4c and Table 2). The periodicity of the water domains (or hydrophobic domains), d, predicted by this model is w54 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima (qmax), 56.7 Å. This value is the distance between water domains. The correlation length (x) obtained from this model is 37.86 Å which is a measure of dispersion.', 'The distance between the water phases, periodicity, was decreased from 59.9 Å to 54 Å with increasing degree of sulfona-tion. The correlation length, x, was increased from 31.14 Å to 37.86 Å when the degree of sulfonation increased. Increasing the interfacial area results in an increase in the x/d ratio. The presence of the upturn in the low range of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 at 55 �C (Fig. 4b and c) is attributed to the fractal morphology of the large scale features.', '3.3. Discussions', 'Scattering data of series of SPTES membranes were obtained in the full hydration state with increasing the sulfonation degree in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. Complete study was performed to provide understanding membranes morphology with increasing the temperature of the hydrated membranes from 25 �C to 55 �C. Proposed model assumes spherical nanodomains containing water molecules forming from clustering of the sulfonation groups. This assumption was performed based on previously reported study which showed spherical nanodomains in the dry SPTES 50 membrane under HR-TEM [29]. The scattering spectra of the membranes with high degree of sulfonation (SPTES 70, and 80) changed significantly when the temperature increased to 55 �C. The morphology is approximated as bi-continuous system where the hydrocarbon is the main support network containing water. This model has been recently proposed by Wnek et al. [40], Gebel [8], and Kreuer [12], Wnek also provided visualization of the hydro-phobic cluster using SYBYL version 6.7 (Tripos) and HINT (Hydro-pathicINTeractions)computationalmodelingsoftware[40]. Despite the support of the transport studies of this model [42], there is no direct visualization method for this proposed approxi-mation. The T. S. model is also supported by high proton conduc-tivity of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 membranes at 55 �C where a larger number of hydronium ions in a larger domain can facilitate proton transport. A summary of the structural evolution of the SPTES membranes as a function of temperature and degree of sulfonation is illustrated in Table 3. This study attempted to study a full range of SPTES membrane nanostructure for the first time and provide an understanding of large membrane water uptakes, and their morphology and their relation with high conductivity of the membranes using both liquid like ordering of polydisperse nano-spheres and bi-continuous T.S. model approximation.', '@', '@', 'Table 3 Summary of membrane structural changes (SPTES 50, 60, 70, and 80 at 25 �C, and SPTES 50 and 60 at 55 �C) as a function of degree of sulfonation and temperature by polydisperse hard sphere model with liquid-like ordering ordering). T.S. bi-continuous model was approximated for higher sulfonation degree copolymers, SPTES 70 and 80, at 55 �C.', '@', '4. Conclusions', 'A series of SPTES copolymers with high proton conductivity of 100e215 mS/cm at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity as potential fuel cells membranes were studied. SANS studies of fully hydrated membranes showed that the nanostructure of the fully hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C in agreement with ionic aggregates containing water molecules with a large scale morphology network of water pockets morphology. This model predicted that the increase in the degree of sulfonation resulted in an increase in the radius of ionic domains and an increase in the volume packing density of water in the aggregates. It was assumed that the same morphology of polydisperse correlated spherical ionic domains were present in the SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymers when the temperature increased to 55 �C. Increase in the degree of sulfonation for fully hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer at 55 �C led to a substantial reorganization of the membrane morphology which was described by a bi-continuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic network.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to thank the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Nano-structured andBiological Materials Branch forfunding this research.

Here, we achieve the first cationic ring-opening polymerization (CROP) of EVL,yielding well-defined polyester PEVL with number average molecular weight up to 12.8 kg/mol and lowdispersity of 1.2. The obtained PEVL contains two kinds of structural units derived from EVL and three kinds of alkenyl groups, indicating an isomerizationduring propagation.

In the 1H NMR spectrum (Figure 1A), thesignal at 6.84-7.02 ppm (H3) is attributed to the proton of C=C double bond adjacent to carbonylgroup, confirming that EVL undergoes a ring-opening processduringpolymerizationratherthananyreactions based on the conjugate C=C double bond. The methylene proton (H10) signal of isomerized EVLrepeating unit (U2) is assigned to 4.55-4.67 ppm while the methine proton (H9) signal originated from EVL repeating unit (U1) at 5.30 ppm is overlappedwith the methylene protons (H6) signal of vinyl group in U1 at 5.16-5.27 ppm. The signals at 5.57-5.85 ppmare ascribed to the methine protons (H5, H7, H8) of the isolated C=C double bonds. The U2 proportion in PEVL calculated by the intensities of H10 versus H3 is 61% and the U1 proportion determined by theintensities of H5,6,9 versus H3 is 38%.', 'In the 13C NMR spectrum (Figure 1B), there are twokinds of signals of alkoxyl carbon next to the carbonyl group (C9 at 74.26 ppm, C10 at 65.01 ppm) and two sets of carbonyl group signals (C1 adjacent to C10 at166.63-166.79 ppm, C2 adjacent to C9 at 167.18-167.33 ppm), in good accordance with the twostructural units (U1 and U2). The signals of C=C double bond of U2 in the backbone appear at 124.37 ppm (C7) and 134.86 ppm (C8). The DEPT 135spectrum (Figure 1C) authenticates that C10 is a secondary carbon whose signal is inverted while C7-9are tertiary ones with upright signals. The above assignments are affirmed by the coupling signals of H9-C9 and H10-C10 in the 1H-13C HSQC NMR spectrum(Figure S4) and those of H5-C9, H6-C9, H7-C10, and H8-C10 in the 1H-13C HMBC NMR spectrum (Figure S5).', 'The alcoholysis of PEVL by methanol is carried outto confirm the existence of the structural unit U2. The methanolizedU2isseparatedbycolumnchromatography and the proton signals of its isolated C=C double bond (HB and HC) appear at 5.67 ppm(Figure 1D, bottom) which are totally different from those (5.91 and 5.09-5.28 ppm) of methanolized EVL (Figure S6). The structure is well confirmed by its 13Cand 1H-13C HSQC NMR spectra (Figure S7-8). EVL is recovered from catalyst-free esterification of themethanolized U1 by removing the generated water (Figure 1D).The characterization of obtainedpolymer indicates the isomerization based on the δ-vinyl group of EVL. The isomerization CROP endowsthe obtained polyester with three kinds of C=C double bonds, including a conjugated one, an isolatedpendent alkenyl group and another one in the backbone.', 'In the Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionizationtime-of-light mass spectrum (MALDI-ToF MS), only one population is observed and the mass interval is152.1 Da corresponding to the molar mass of EVL (Figure 1E). The observation of the molecular weightof polymer chain without any residues of initiators or terminators like methanol added during the work-up suggests the cyclic topology of PEVL. To furtherconfirm the cyclic topology, the ammonolysis of PEVL is carefully conducted to obtain its linear analogue.As detected by MALDI-ToF MS, part of cyclic PEVL is broken by benzyl amine and water (Figure 1F). No shoulder of low molecular weight appears on the SECcurve and the Mn keeps constant (before: 6.8 kg/mol, Ɖ = 1.4; after: 7.2 kg/mol, Ɖ = 1.4, Figure S9) thanksto the cyclic topology of the original PEVL. The topology fidelity of cyclic PEVL is further verified bythe linear relationship of Mn to retention time accordingtoMALS-SECtest(FigureS10).Traditionally, cyclic structure is accessible via ringclosing or ring expansion mechanisms. The former strategy requires extreme diluted condition25,26 andthe latter one includes ring-opening metathesis polymerization27andzwitterionicpolymerization.28,29 The formation of cyclic PEVL issimilar to that in zwitterionic polymerization but following the CROP mechanism (Scheme 1). The carboxylic group stabilized by Ph3C+ is ready to attackthe positive propagating chain end as intramolecular transfer reaction, to form cyclic PEVL and liberate anew initiator (Ph3C+PF6-) for further initiation. To our best knowledge, it is the first time that cyclic polyester is synthesized via the CROP of lactonewithout any linear contaminants.', '@', '@', 'Accordingly, the CROP of EVL is investigated indetail using Ph3C+PF6- as initiator. The results are summarized in Table 1.When polymerizationtemperature increases from 0 to 40 ℃, the bulk of polymerizationisgelledafter1dayandtheconversion of EVL reaches 74.2% (Entry 2 in Table 1). However, NMR analysis (Figure S11-13) of the obtained polymer with decreased Mn of 1.3 kg/molindicates a hybrid polymerization of EVL (CROP and addition polymerization of its δ-vinyl group) at 40 ℃.Additionally, the yield of polymer is reduced to 37.6% after precipitation in hexane. In the hexane soluble fraction,anisomerofEVL,(E)-2-ethylidene-5-heptene-4-olide(EHO)isseparatedandcharacterized(FigureS14-15),explainingthemismatch between conversion and yield. EHO has been reported as a by-product in the synthesis ofEVL.3,30Decreasingpolymerizationtemperaturesignificantly suppresses the side reaction formingEHO and switches hybrid polymerization into CROP.', 'As the temperature decreases from 10 to -30 ℃, theMn of PEVL increases from 6.5 to 12.8 kg/mol (Entries 1, 3-6 in Table 1, Figure S16). Solvents nomattering their polarity are all adverse to the Ph3C+PF6--initiated CROP of EVL (Table S2). Only indioxane(Entry4inTableS2),PEVLwithasignificantly lower yield (11.9%) than those in bulk (31.5%) is obtained. Increasing the feed ratio ofcationic initiators results in higher conversion of EVL, but the Mns and Ɖs are constant indicating a non-living polymerization characteristic (Entry 1, 7, 8 in Table 1).', 'A kinetic study of CROP of EVL is conducted at 0 ℃.A linear relationship between ln([M]0/[M]) and polymerization time is observed, confirming a first-orderkinetics(FigureS17).Aspolymerizationprocess progresses, the conversion of EVL increaseswhile the Mns and Ɖs are changeless. Specially, the U2 proportion in PEVL has no significant alterationduring the polymerization process (59-61%, Entries 1, 9-14), indicating a random distribution of U1 and U2 in PEVL. The characteristics of the CROP of EVLare quite similar with those of the traditional radical polymerization,whichare“slowinitiation,fastpropagation and easy transfer/termination”. The concentration of active propagating chains can be considered as constant, resulting in the first-orderedkinetic of EVL.', 'To reveal thepolymerizationmechanism,thehexane-soluble fraction of CROP of EVL at 0 ℃is investigated and another five-membered lactone, (E)-3-ethylidene-5-(3,3,3-triphenylprop-1-en-1-yl)dihydrofuran-2(3H)-one (EtPPL), is isolated. The structure of EtPPL, which is exactly a trityl-attachedEHO, is characterized by NMR spectrometry and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (Figure S18-23). EtPPL is generated by the side reaction between the δ-vinyl group of EVL and trityl (SchemeS1),whichisconfirmedbydensityfunctional theory (DFT) calculation (Figure S24). The exocyclic carbenium (intermediate S-1 in Scheme S1),generated by the attack of δ-vinyl group of EVL to trityl, undergoes [1,3]-H shifts to form an intra-ring carbenium (S-2 in Scheme S1) and the calculatedGibbs free energy barrier (ΔG≠) is low (9.0 kcal/mol). Then the carbon-oxygen bond shifts to the endocycliccarbenium through an oxonium intermediate (S-3 in Scheme S1) with ΔG≠of 7.0 kcal/mol, generating a five-membered lactone with an exocyclic carbenium(S-4, Scheme S1). The shrinkage of ring size from six to five is exothermic with ΔG of -3.9 kcal/mol. The β-proton elimination of species S-4 generate EtPPL and H+PF6-. The later one catalyzes the isomerization of EVL into EHO at 40 ℃.', '@', '@', 'a Polymerizations are conducted in bulk. b Determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy of the polymerization mixture. c The molar ratio of isomerized EVL unit (U2) in PEVL determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy of the obtained PEVL. dDetermined by SEC equipped with multi angle light scattering detector. e The obtained polymer is hybrid withpolyester and polyolefin (Figure S11), which is not polyester PEVL. The U2 portion versus (U1+U2) portion is 63%. fDetermined by SEC equipped with refractive index detector because of its different structure from PEVL.', 'To demonstrate the necessity of isomerization toCROP, the semi-hydrogenated EVL derivative, α-ethylidene-δ-ethyl-δ-valerolactone (EEL, Figure S25-27), is prepared for CROP initiated by Ph3C+PF6-. It turns out that the homo-polymerization of EELinitiated by Ph3C+PF6- at 0 ℃for 7 d yields no polymer (Entry 1 in Table S3). The copolymerization of EVL with EEL results in trace polymer (Entry 2 inTable S3). In the 1H NMR spectrum of the polymer (Figure S28), the intensity ratio of signals at 4.51-5.95 ppm (H2-7) versus those at 6.86-7.02 ppm (H1) is 4.0, which confirms only PEVL from CROP is obtainedwithout EEL unit. Otherwise, the intensity ratio should be lower than 4.0 due to the absence of vinylgroup in EEL. In addition, no signals near 1.00 ppm are observed, to which the methyl proton of EEL unit shouldbeassigned.Furthermore,onlyonepopulation with 152.1 Da mass interval is detected by the MALDI-ToF MS (Figure S29), confirming no incorporation of EEL. The results indicates that theresonance of the vinyl group with the carbenium propagating chain end is essential to the CROP of EVL(Scheme 1) and CROP fails when the δ-vinyl group is absent (EEL).', 'DFT calculation provides further insight in theisomerization CROP of EVL (Figure 2). The ester group of EVL cooperates with the carbenium E+(Ph3C+) and EVL ring-opens to generate an active carbenium (Scheme 1) stabilized by as well as resonated with the neighboring vinyl group. The nextEVLmonomercomestobeattackedbythecarbenium at α- or γ-position (i.e. α- or γ-propagation,Figure 2A), followed by the ring-opening of the coming EVL. In γ-propagation, the vinyl group rearranges generating ethylene on backbone and EVLis inserted into the polymer in an isomerized structure (U2). According to DFT calculation, theGibbs free energy profiles of α- and γ-propagation to form different units (U1 and U2) are demonstrated (Figure 2B). The propagations include two transitionsteps consisting of cationic addition and cleavage of alkoxyl bonds. In cationic addition, alkoxyl oxygen onEVL is attacked by active carbenium (INT0α and INT0γ) to give stable species (INT1α and INT1γ) travelled by TS1α and TS1γ. The new allyl cations(INT2α and INT2γ) are formed via cleavage of alkoxyl bond as a typical cationic polymerization process.', '@', '@', 'Theresultsconfirmthatbothoftheratedetermined steps of α- and γ-propagation are the cleavage of alkoxyl bond (TS2α and TS2γ). The energybarrier ΔGγ-a≠of 10.5 kcal/mol is slightly lower than ΔGα-a≠of 10.9 kcal/mol and the ΔG (2.8 kcal/mol) of γ-propagation is also lower than that (5.6 kcal/mol)of α-propagation, indicating that the γ-propagation is both kinetically and thermodynamically favored overα-propagation. According to the RRKM theory,31 the proportion of γ-propagation is about 63% (Equation S1), in accordance with the experimental results thatthe U2 portion in the obtained PEVL is 59-61%. It is worthy of noticing that the energy barrier of the sidereaction of vinyl group and carbenium (ΔGre≠= 16.0 kcal/mol)ishigherthanthoseofα-andγ-propagation, implying that the main reaction is CROPof EVL rather than the formation of EtPPL byproduct.', 'The yielded PEVL exhibits great thermal stabilitywith decomposition temperature at 5% mass loss (Td,5%) of 279 ℃(Figure S30). The glass transition temperature (Tg) of cyclic PEVL is barely dependenton its Mn (-33.6 ℃for Mn = 7.1 kg/mol and -33.1 ℃ for Mn = 12.8 kg/mol, Figure 3A). On the contrary, theobtained polymer from polymerization of EVL at 40 ℃possesses a Tg of 0.7 ℃(Figure S31) as the result of hybrid polymer backbone.', 'The intact C=C double bonds in PEVL is ready forpost-polymerization functionalization.

The introductionof crystalline octadecyl side group endows PEVL with a melting point (Tm) of 42.2 ℃and crystallizationtemperature (Tc) of 32.8 ℃(Figure 3B), different from those of free 1-octadecanethiol (Figure S34).', '@', '@', 'Inconclusion,thering-openinghomo-polymerizationofα-ethylidene-δ-vinyl-δ-valerolactone (EVL), a difunctional lactone derived fromCO2and1,3-butadiene,isrealizedviaisomerization CROP initiated by robust cationic initiators(e.g.,Ph3C+PF6-).Theobtainedcyclicpolyester PEVL is carefully characterized to bear twostructural units derived from EVL and three kinds of alkenyl groups (an ethylidene and a vinyl group inthe side chain and a C=C double bond in the main chain).Itisthefirstexampleofquantitativeformation of cyclic polymer in CROP of lactone.
