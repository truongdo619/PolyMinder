2025-05-21 11:43:38 - WARNING: ['Polyurethanes synthesized from diisocyanate trimers and polyethylene glycol undergo crosslinking via thermally reversible Diels–Alder reactions', 'Heru Santoso1,2 · Sabrina Aufar Salma2 · Frita Yuliati2 · Shayrilla Chairunnisa Nur Afifa3 · Sumarno Sumarno1', 'Received: 11 November 2024 / Revised: 17 February 2025 / Accepted: 7 March 2025  © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Polymer Society of Korea 2025', 'Abstract', 'A series of self-healing polyurethane (PU) polymers were synthesized via the Diels–Alder reaction between the furan-functionalized PU prepolymer and bismaleimide (BMI). The PU prepolymer is a reaction product of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and a pentamethylene diisocyanate trimer (PDI-t). Furfuryl amine was attached to the terminal isocyanic groups of PU, resulting in furfuryl amine polyurethane (PU-FA). PU-FA was cross-linked via dynamic bonds between the furan groups and BMI, generating reversible bonds with the material. This study explored reversible polymer networks under various thermal conditions, including different reaction parameters, prepolymer ratios, and healing temperatures, to evaluate the healing capabilities of these polymers. The results demonstrated that PU-DA exhibits thermal reversibility, as evidenced by the appearance of an endothermic peak in the DSC analysis, indicating bond cleavage via the retro-Diels–Alder (r-DA) reaction. This endothermic peak re-emerged after cooling at 70 °C for 24 h, further confirming the reversibility of the reac-tion. Additionally, crack healing in the PU-DA film was facilitated by the synergistic effects of the thermally reversible Diels–Alder reaction and the thermal mobility of molecular chains. The self-healing performance evaluation revealed that PU-DA samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 exhibited a reduction in tensile strength after healing compared to the original PU-DA specimens before heat treatment. Conversely, samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 demonstrated a healing efficiency exceeding 100%, attributed to the enhanced cross-link density, which contributed to a more robust network structure.', '@', '@', "In this study, self-healing Diels-Alder polyurethane (PU-DA) was successfully synthesized using PDI trimer. The findings confirmed that the material's healing mechanism is activated by the reversible interaction between furan and maleimide groups within PU-DA, enabling it to autonomously repair structural damage", 'Keywords Polyurethane · Prepolymer · Self-healing · Pentamethylene diisocyanate trimer · Diels–Alder', '1 Introduction', 'Polyurethane has profoundly improved the quality of modern life through its diverse applications across multiple industries. It is integral in enhancing the performance and functionality of products in sectors, such as coatings, automotive, textiles, synthetic leather, electronics, construction materials, aerospace, and medicine. This versatile material not only improves the durability and efficiency of these products but also contributes to advances in technology and quality of life [1–4]. In practical applications, polyurethane is susceptible to the development of small cracks due to factors, such as heat, mechanical stress, and exposure to chemicals. These microcracks can significantly reduce the service life of polyurethane and are often challenging to detect visually [5]. Inspired by the self-repair mechanisms observed in nature, scientists have engineered polymers with inherent self-healing capabilities within certain limits. Self-healing strategies can be broadly categorized as extrinsic or intrinsic [6]. Extrinsic self-healing involves the incorporation of a healing agent within a polymer matrix; however, this method lacks reusability, because the healing agent is depleted upon each use. With this method, no external stimuli are needed for healing to occur. Conversely, the intrinsic self-healing system enables repetitive healing across multiple cycles of damage, although most methods in this system require external stimuli to initiate the healing process. As a result, intrinsic self-healing materials have attracted increasing attention in recent years [7].', 'Intrinsic self-healing materials normally contain dynamic bonds or interactions that can be broken and reformed to heal the material. These bonds can be covalent or nonco-valent in nature. Covalent bonds are often used because of their high strength of the bonds. Some examples of these bonds are Diels–Alder, disulfide, radical interactions, and cyclic compounds [8, 9]. Numerous studies have been conducted to develop self-healing polyurethanes with Diels–Alder chemistry. Self-healing polyurethanes (SH-PU) via the Diels–Alder method mostly comprise isocyanic polyurethane (to differ from nonisocyanic polyurethane) and commonly employ two main approaches. The first method involves the incorporation of furan terminals into the PU prepolymer, which are subsequently crosslinked with bis-maleimide (BMI). The second method involves the prepa-ration of a PU prepolymer containing maleimide pendant groups, which consequently react with difunctional furan compounds to produce SH-PU [5].', 'For isocyanates, researchers prefer the use of aliphatic isocyanate trimers for polyurethane coatings, because they offer lower toxicity, enhanced thermal stability, superior mechanical properties, and increased weather resistance [10]. The use of isocyanate trimers in the synthesis of self-healing polyurethane via the Diels–Alder system is wide-spread among researchers, with isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) trimers being the most commonly used [11–13]. IPDI is a cycloaliphatic isocyanate with one ring structure, whereas the IPDI trimer comprises a structure with four rings. These rings make the obtained polyurethane more rigid than when the diisocyanate is fully aliphatic, while more flexible materials are needed. To fill this gap, the entirely aliphatic hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and its trimers (HDI-t) were used. Researchers have used HDI-t to fabricate self-healing polymers [14–22]. To answer the demand for greener materials, the bio-based pentamethyl-ene diisocyanate and its trimer are already available in the market. Some researchers have employed pentamethylene diisocyanate trimers (PDI-t) in the synthesis of functional polyurethanes [23–25]. Most studies on self-healing polyu-rethanes primarily use the conventional isocyanates derived from fossil resources, such as 1,6-diisocyanatohexane (HDI), which does not align with the growing demand for more environmentally sustainable and eco-friendly materials [26, 27]. Despite its promising potential to improve cross-linking density and mechanical properties, the use of PDI-trimer derived from bio-based sources as an isocyanate has not been widely explored. In this study, we investigated the self-healing synthesis of PDI-trimer as an isocyanate through the Diels–Alder reaction method, focusing on the impact of the NCO/OH ratio on its thermal behavior, healing efficiency, and mechanical performance. A series of PU prepolymer formulations were synthesized from polyethylene glycol (PEG) and PDI-trimer (PDI-t) at different reaction times, temperatures, and NCO/OH ratios. These prepolymers were then reacted with furfuryl amine (FA) to yield PU-FA. Addi-tionally, self-healing polyurethane (SH-PU) was synthesized by cross-linking PU-FA with bismaleimide (BMI) via the Diels–Alder reaction. These experiments were performed to understand how the different synthesis conditions affect the mechanical properties and healing behavior of the end polymer products. The knowledge is expected to contribute to the development of green polyurethane, particularly for coating application.', '2 \x07Experimental', '2.1 \x07Materials', "Furfurylamine (99%, FA), 1,1'-(methylenedi-4,1-phenylene) bismaleimide (BMI), polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG), and dibutyltin dilaurate (95%, DBTDL) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Before polymerization, polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG) with a molecular weight of 4000 g/mol was dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 2 h. The isocyanate trimer Desmodur® eco N7300 (pentamethylene diisocy-anate/PDI-t), with an NCO content of 21.9% and an equiva-lent weight of 195, was sourced directly from PT Covestro Indonesia without further purification. Dimethylformamide (DMF), which was used as the solvent in the procedure, was purchased from Merck. Polyurethane with a furan terminal (PU-FA) and self-healing polyurethane (PU-DA) were syn-thesized as described in the previous studies [11, 28]. The synthesis details are described in the supporting information. FTIR spectroscopy spectra were acquired using a Brucker Tensor 27 spectrometer via the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) method, which uses 64 scans with a resolution of 4 \xadcm − 1 in transmittance mode in the wavenumber range of 4000–500 \xadcm − 1. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis was conducted using a Bruker Avance Neo 700 MHz NMR spectrophotometer with DMSO-d6 and \xadCDCl3 as solvents. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of PU-furan and PU-DA was performed using a Linseis STA instrument (STA PT1600) under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 °C min1 from 30 to 900 °C. The thermal behavior of PU-DA was assessed via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) using a Perkin Elmer DSC 8000 instru-ment in the temperature range of 0–190 °C. The heating and cooling rates were 20 °C/min, and all experiments were conducted under a protective nitrogen atmosphere. The melting temperature \xad(Tm) and entropy of fusion (ΔHm) data were collected during the second heating run. The density of the crosslinked polyurethanes (PUs) was determined using a pycnometer with distilled water as the immersion liquid. To assess the crosslink density of the samples, the degree of swelling, and gel content, the samples were measured. Samples 10 × 10x0.3 mm in size were immersed in 10 mL of toluene at room temperature in sealed containers for 24 h. Afterward, the film was washed with toluene and weighed to determine its mass \xad(ms). The films were subsequently sub-jected to drying at 35 °C initially under atmospheric pressure and then under vacuum, after which the weight of the dried film \xad(md) was recorded. The degree of swelling (Q) and gel content (G) were calculated using Eqs. (1) and (2) [29, 30]", '2.2 \x07Characterization', 'Q = 1 + 휌1휌2( msmd −1).', 'Furthermore', 'G(%) = mdmiso × 100.', 'Here, ρ1 and ρ2 represent the densities of the solvent (tol-uene, ρ: 0.8669 g/cm3) and the PU polymer, respectively.

The sheet samples were intentionally scratched at a depth of 0.5 mm and then subjected to five dif-ferent heating treatments to observe their self-healing ability. The treatments involved heating at temperatures of 100 °C, 110 °C, 120 °C, and 130 °C for 10 min, heating at 130 °C for 2 h, and cooling at 70 °C for 24 h. A quantitative study was conducted to evaluate the recovery of tensile strength following the self-healing process, utilizing a universal test-ing machine (Shimadzu AG–X Plus 50 kN). PU-DA samples were prepared as specimens according to ASTM D638 type 4, which were scratched in the center with a knife blade measuring 1 cm in length and 1 mm in depth. The self-healing process was then performed by heating the samples at 130 °C for 2 h, followed by a 24-h period at 70 °C. The self-healing efficiency was calculated based on the recovery of tensile strength using Eq. (3)', 'Healing Efficiency (% ) = Tensile strength healedTensile strength original × 100%.', '3 \x07Results and discussion', '3.1 \x07Synthesis of polyurethane Diels–Alder (PU‑DA)', 'The synthesis pathway of PU-DA is depicted in Fig. 1, and the reaction conditions are explained in Table 1. Initially, PEG was reacted with an excess PDI-trimer to obtain a prepolymer with isocyanates as the terminal functional groups. Because of the different reaction conditions applied during this step, the prepolymers were assumed to possess different properties, as observed during the reaction. The prepolymer was subsequently reacted with furfuryl amine (FA), resulting in the formation of furan-terminated polyurethane (PU-FA). The final product polyurethane Diels–Alder (PU-DA) was obtained through the Diels–Alder reaction between PU-FA and bismaleimide (BMI) at 80 °C, followed by solvent evaporation at 60 °C under vacuum. Structural analysis of polyethylene glycol (PEG), the PDI-trimer, PU-FA, and PU-DA was performed using 1H-NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 2).', 'The NMR spectrum of PU-FA (Fig. 2c) reveals the suc-cessful synthesis of the PU prepolymer and the subsequent incorporation of the furan group. The PU prepolymer struc-ture is revealed by the emergence of a carbamate bond (NH‒COO) peak at 3.41 ppm (c). The furan group attached to the prepolymer is distinguished by the presence of distinct furan ring peaks at 6.18 ppm (m), 6.37 ppm (n), and 7.55 ppm (o). Additionally, an amide group, which indicates the urethane or urea proton NH, was observed at 5.90 ppm (d, k). Further-more, the product of the PU-FA and BMI reactions (Fig. 2d), a Diels–Alder adduct, is characterized by notable proton shifts at 3.07 ppm (r), 5.18 ppm (q), and 6.42–6.59 ppm (p). The aromatic structure of BMI is indicated by peaks in the range of 7.26–7.35 ppm (s, t). Additionally, the characteris-tic methylene peak originating from BMI was identified at 3.9 ppm (u).', '@', '@', "The formation of the polyurethane prepolymer from the reaction between polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the pentamethylene diisocyanate (PDI) trimer was confirmed through FTIR spectroscopy, as depicted in Fig. 3 and S1. The FTIR spectrum reveals a characteristic absorption peak at 2270 cm⁻1, which corresponds to the stretching vibration of the isocyanate (NCO) group. This distinct peak serves as a definitive indicator of the presence of the polyurethane prepolymer and remains detectable throughout the progression of the reaction, providing consistent evidence of the NCO group's role in the synthesis process. The ATR-FTIR spectra shown in Fig. 3 for the PU prepolymer, PU-FA, and PU-DA support the findings of the 1H NMR analysis. The lack of a peak at 2270 cm⁻1 in PU-FA confirms that the isocyanate group has reacted, indicating no residual isocyanate group remains. In contrast, the emergence of peaks at 1012, 736, and 811 \xadcm−1 distinctly confirms the incorporation of a furan ring in PU–FA [31, 32]. Compared with PU-FA, PU-DA has an obvious shoulder peak at 1710 \xadcm−1, which is characteristic of the DA adduct (–C = O band of imide) [33]. Simultaneously, the intensity decreases at 1012, 811, and 736 \xadcm−1, stemming from the consumption of the furan ring by the BMI molecule (Fig. 3b). This reduction clearly indicates the success of the PU–FA reaction with BMI through the Diels–Alder reaction.", '@', '@ DSC analyses of both the pristine PEG and PU-DA formulations were carried out over a temperature range of 0 °C to 190 °C. Figure 4a shows the DSC curve of pristine PEG, which shows distinct melting and crystallization peaks at 61.1 °C and 21.5 °C, respectively. In contrast, Fig. 4b shows that the endothermic peak (melting temperature) of PU-DA is generally lower than that of pristine PEG (61.1 °C). This difference results from the hindrance of multiple PEG crystalline segments as they interact during the formation of Diels–Alder cross-links, restricting their ability to organize into a well-defined crystalline structure. [34]. The cooling DSC curve (Fig. 4c) shows the reformation of PEG characterized by an exothermic peak. Owing to the inhibition of chain mobility by Diels–Alder crosslinks, PU-DA formulations tend to display higher crystallization temperatures than pristine PEG, indicating that recrystallization occurred earlier during cooling. Figure 4d shows the first and second heating–cooling cycles in the DSC thermogram of PU-DA formula 6. In the first heating cycle (black line), the thermogram of PU shows a modest endothermic peak between 110 and 150 °C, indicating the occurrence of a retro-DA reaction (release of furan and maleimide group bonds) [35]. Moreover, in the cooling curve (red line), a small exothermic peak at approximately 72 °C (as clearly shown in the inset photograph) suggests', '3.2 \x07Thermal characteristics and reversibility of Diels–Alder (DA) bonds the reformation of DA adduct bonds, which are possibly obscured by PEG recrystallization. Meanwhile, during the second heating cycle (blue line), the absence of the endothermic peak can be attributed to the insufficient interval between the two cycles, which prevented the complete reconstruction of the DA bonds. This inadequacy led to the peak not being discernible by DSC during the second heating cycle [36, 37].', 'In Table 2, the melting enthalpies of the eight polyu-rethane Diels–Alder (PU-DA) formulations ranged from 25.5 to 134.5 J/g, while the crystallization enthalpies (ΔHc) ranged from 26.2 to 136.8 J/g. Compared to pristine PEG (ΔHm = 158.3 J/g, ΔHc = 137.0 J/g), the PU-DA formulation exhibits a lower melting and crystallization enthalpy, sug-gesting that the crystallization and melting of PEG segments are hindered. This reduction is attributed to the restricted molecular mobility imposed by Diels–Alder cross-linking, which limits the ability of PEG chains to organize into a well-defined crystalline structure [38]. The synthesis of PU-DA involved NCO/OH ratios of 1.5 and 3. Notably, the data in Table 2 indicate that an NCO/OH ratio of 3 resulted in lower melting and crystallization enthalpies than an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5. This difference may stem from the higher NCO/OH ratio, which intensifies the disruption of PEG crystalline segments as a result of increased Diels–Alder cross-link formation. Consequently, the restricted molecular mobility leads to lower melting and crystallization enthalp-ies compared to the sample with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5. This is further evidenced by the NCO/OH ratio of 3, which corresponds to a higher gel content value compared to the ratio of 1.5.', 'One advantage of intrinsic self-healing materials lies in the repeatability of their healing process, which stems from the reversibility of dynamic bonds. The thermal reversibility of Diels–Alder bonds further elucidate this mechanism. The thermal treatment of the PU-DA samples (Fig. 5a) and subsequent DSC measurements with consistent parameters revealed significant insights. In Fig. 5b, the observed peak (38–60 °C) indicates the melting of PEG crystals within the Diels–Alder polyurethane matrix. The thermograms also revealed modest endothermic peaks, indicating the breakage of DA adducts from the original polymer synthesis', '@', '@ process (DA1) at 120 °C (sample F5-PUDA) and 140 °C (F6-PUDA). After heat treatment and cooling at 70 °C, DSC observations (Fig. 5c and Table S2) revealed decreased melting and crystallization enthalpies of PEG in DA2 compared with those in DA1, which was attributed to the presence of DA2 bonds hindering the mobility of the PEG crystalline segments [39]. The decrease in enthalpies indicates Diels–Alder bond reconstruction during heating at 70 °C for 24 h. This phenomenon confirmed the reproducible thermal reversibility of the synthesized PU-DA samples.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Tm and \xadTc represent the melting/crystallization temperature, respectively; ΔHm and ΔHc represent the melt-ing/crystallization enthalpy, respectively, and the density (ρ), degree of swelling (Q), and gel content (G) were measured experimentally', '@', '@', 'Figure 6 shows the TGA and DTG curves of the Diels–Alder polyurethane sample under consistent heating conditions. The DTG curve reveals two distinct stages of thermal decomposition, marked by a minor peak in the initial stage and a substantial mass loss in the subsequent stage. The observed minor peak at approximately 160 °C likely arises from the evaporation of residual DMF within the material [40]. While the TGA curves of the PU-DA series are similar, the polyurethane samples F2 and F8 exhibit lower thermal stability, which can be related to their lower gel contents. In this sample, the rapid formation of the PU prepolymer restricts the extent to which furan groups can react with the prepolymer. Consequently, furan groups face challenges in integrating into the maleimide structure, leading to decreased formation of Diels–Alder crosslinks.', '3.3 \x07Healing ability', 'The self-healing behaviors of the eight PU-DA samples were comprehensively assessed using qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The qualitative evaluation involved a scratch test to visually assess the material’s healing capacity, whereas quantitative analysis was performed by determining the percentage of healing efficiency via hardness measurements. To qualitatively explore the healing process, the PU-DA film samples were subjected to five distinct heating treatments. The four treatments included heating the samples at temperatures ranging from 100 to 130 °C for 10 min each, followed by cooling to ambient temperature. The fifth treatment consisted of heating the sample at 130 °C for 2 h to promote the retro-Diels–Alder reaction, followed by heating at 70 °C for 24 h to facilitate the Diels–Alder reaction. The outcomes were evaluated using a digital microscope set at 100 × magnification. The results of the four thermal treatments are shown in Figure S2-S3, and the results of the fifth thermal treatment are shown in Fig. 8.', '@', '@', 'Polyurethane chains consist of soft segments derived from polyols and hard segments derived from isocyanates, with thermal energy influencing the mobility of these segments. Generally, soft segments exhibit greater mobility than hard segments upon heating, while hard segments restrict the thermal motion of molecular chains. Consequently, the self-healing capability of PU-DA is significantly influenced by the ratio of soft-to-hard segments, which can be controlled by adjusting the NCO/OH molar ratio. Observations from optical microscopy (Fig. 7) of the healing test conducted at 100 °C indicate that samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 (formulas F1–F4) exhibit faster scratch recovery compared to those with a ratio of 3 (formulas F5–F8). Similar trends were observed at 110, 120, and 130 °C (Figure S2.I-II and S3.III-IV), where samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 demonstrated superior healing efficiency. This phenomenon can be attributed to the higher proportion of soft segments in the 1.5 ratio, which enhances the mobility of the PU chains, allowing PU-FA and BMI to reflow and fill cracks after heat treatment. Conversely, samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 contain fewer soft segments, restricting polymer chain mobility and impeding the healing process [41].', '@', '@', '@', '@', "The thermally induced self-healing property of PU-DA is linked to the dissociation and reformation of Diels–Alder (DA) bonds. The images below illustrate the response of the PU-DA samples to various temperature treatments, confirm-ing the reconstruction of the DA bonds in the crosslinked network under thermal stimulation. PU-DA film samples etched at the same position were heated at temperatures ranging from 100 to 130 °C for 10 min each. At 100 °C, most scratches remained visible, although slight healing at the scratch base was observed (Figure S2.I). At 110 °C, some PU-DA samples exhibited increased healing, although small scars from incomplete healing were still present (Fig-ure S2.II). Treatments at 120 °C and 130 °C (Figures S3. III-IV) resulted in significantly better healing responses than those at lower temperatures, with tightly closed cracks indi-cating a reversible reaction between the furan and maleimide groups on the PU-DA surface [34]. Wool and O'Connor’s theory posits that the polymer chain diffusion rate is cru-cial in controlling the healing speed during the crack heal-ing process [42]. The temperature significantly affected the diffusion rate. When heated, the scratched surface deforms back to its original position, bringing the separated surfaces into contact. Simultaneously, the retro-DA reaction acceler-ates chain interdiffusion between the crack surfaces after clo-sure, leading to successful healing [43]. The scratches on the PU-PA film disappeared completely after heating to 130 °C for 2 h (Figure S3). This heating caused fluidization, which facilitated self-healing of the damaged area. Upon cooling to 70 °C, rebonding occurred, leading to the reconstruction of the Diels–Alder cross-linked network [44].", 'The quantitative evaluation of self-healing was conducted by measuring the recovery of tensile strength using a univer-sal testing machine (Shimadzu AG–X Plus 50kN). PU-DA samples were prepared by casting polymer films from a DMF solution, with dimensions of 17 cm in length, 16 cm in width, and a thickness ranging from 0.5 to 1 mm. The films were then subjected to solvent evaporation at 65 °C for 24 h. Specimens were prepared by punching the films according to the ASTM D638 type 4 standard, followed by introducing a scratch measuring 1 cm in length and 1 mm in depth at the center using a knife blade. The self-healing process was performed by heating the specimens at 130 °C for 2 h, and then maintaining them at 70 °C for 24 h. The healing efficiency was quantified based on the recovery of tensile strength, calculated using Eq. (3).', 'In this study, the self-healing behavior of PU-DA samples was evaluated using formulations with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 for the F5-F8 samples and 1.5 for the F1-F4 samples. Figure 8b presents the representative stress–strain curves of the original and healed PU-DA samples after being scratched. The corresponding values of tensile strength, elongation at break, and elastic modulus are shown in Fig. 8c–8e. The results from the tensile strength and elongation at break tests (Fig. 8c and 8d) indicate a distinct trend in healing performance, samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 exhibited a reduction in tensile strength and elongation at break after healing, whereas those with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 showed an increase in both properties following the healing process. Furthermore, the elastic modulus (Fig. 8e) increased in all PU-DA samples, regardless of the NCO/OH ratio. The evaluation of self-healing performance in PU-DA samples revealed distinct differences in mechanical properties depending on the NCO/OH ratio used during synthesis. Specifically, PU-DA formulations with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 (Formulas F1–F5) exhibited a noticeable decline in tensile strength after the healing process when compared to PU-DA specimens that had not undergone thermal treatment. This reduction suggests that a lower cross-linking density may have limited the material’s ability to recover its original mechanical integrity. Conversely, PU-DA samples synthesized with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 (Formulas F5–F8) displayed a significant enhancement in healing efficiency, surpassing 100%. This remarkable self-healing capability is primarily attributed to the presence of a greater number of cross-links within the polymer network, which is directly correlated with the observed increase in gel content. The higher cross-link density not only facilitated more effective reformation of the molecular structure after damage but also contributed to improved tensile strength, exceeding that of the original PU-DA sample before healing. These findings highlight the critical role of cross-linking density in optimizing self-healing properties and mechanical robustness in thermally reversible polyurethane systems.', "The self-healing performance of PU-DA is governed by the synergistic effects of thermally induced polyurethane chain mobility and the thermo-reversible Diels–Alder (DA) reaction. Consequently, the self-healing capability of PU-DA is strongly influenced by the ratio of soft-to-hard segments, which can be controlled through the NCO/OH molar ratio. At an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5, the tensile strength after healing decreases compared to the original PU-DA sample (see Table 3). In contrast, when compared to a ratio of 3, both the pre- and post-healing tensile strength values are lower. This phenomenon can be attributed to the lower crosslink density, as indicated by the gel content, in PU-DA samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 compared to those with a ratio of 3 (see Fig. 9f and Table S3). The reduced crosslink density in the 1.5 ratio results in lower tensile strength relative to the 3.0 ratio. At a higher hard-segment content (i.e., an NCO/OH ratio of 3), the formation of additional crosslinks between hard segments enhances structural integrity, requiring more energy to disrupt the network [45]. Self-healing efficiency is influenced by the polymer chain's ability to diffuse across the crack area and the availability of broken cross-links for reformation. These two factors exhibit an inverse relationship: as the cross-link density increases, chain diffusion is hindered, leading to a higher number of broken cross-links. At lower cross-linking levels, mechanical strength decreases. This phenomenon explains why the self-healing efficiency of the PU-DA sample with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 is lower compared to the ratio of 3, where the gel content is higher. Additionally, self-healing values exceeding 100%, which are attributed to the presence of cross-links reflected in the gel content, result in higher tensile strength than the original PU-DA sample [46, 47].", '4 \x07Conclusions', 'The behavior of the isocyanate trimer (PDI-trimer) in the synthesis of self-healing polyurethane (PU-DA) via the Diels–Alder (DA) reaction was investigated through the reaction between the furan-terminated prepolymer and bismaleimide. Digital microscopy and DSC observations revealed that cracks with a depth of 0.5 mm in the PU-DA film could be repaired after heat treatment at 120–130 °C for 10 min, achieving complete healing at 130 °C for 10 min, followed by cooling at 70 °C for 24 h. The tightly closed cracks indicate a reversible reaction between the furan and maleimide groups on the surface of the PU-DA sample. Additionally, the DSC results revealed an endothermic peak in the PU-DA material (DA1), indicating the breakage of the Diels–Alder bond (r-DA). After cooling at 70 °C for 24 h, the endothermic peak remained visible (DA2), demonstrating the thermal reversibility of the synthesized PU-DA samples, which allows for repeated healing due to the reversibility of the Diels–Alder bond.', '@', '@', 'a A self-healing efficiency of 100% is attained when a PU-DA sample that undergoes a healing process—comprising heat treatment at 130 °C for 2 h followed by additional heating at 70 °C for 24 h—restores its tensile strength to the same level as the original, unhealed sample that has not undergone any thermal treatment. It is important to note that PU-DA1 refers to the pristine PU-DA sample, while PU-DA2 represents the healed PU-DA specimen', '@', '@', 'The NCO/OH ratio significantly influences the forma-tion of the furan‒maleimide crosslink bond structure. At a ratio of 3, the formation of PEG crystals is smaller than that at a ratio of 1.5, indicating that a higher ratio leads to more crosslink bonds and a decrease in the melting enthalpy value in DSC measurements. The healing efficiency of PU-DA samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 (Formulas F1-F5) showed a reduction in tensile strength compared to the unheated PU-DA specimens. In contrast, PU-DA sam-ples with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 (Formulas F5-F8) dem-onstrated enhanced healing efficiency, exceeding 100%, which can be attributed to the higher density of cross-links. This increased cross-linking, as reflected in the gel content, resulted in greater tensile strength than the original PU-DA sample. These findings provide valuable insights into the development of self-healing materials utilizing PDI-trimer via the Diels–Alder reaction, a relatively underexplored area in polymer research.', 'Supplementary Information The online version containssupplementary material available at https://\u200bdoi.\u200borg/\u200b10.\u200b1007/s13233-\u200b025-\u200b00400-y.', 'Acknowledgements This research was supported by the ResearchOrganization for Nanotechnology and Materials [National Researchand Innovation Agency of Indonesia (No. 3/III.10/HK/2023)] and theResearch Center for Polymer Technology.', 'Author contributions All authors contributed to the study conception and design.
