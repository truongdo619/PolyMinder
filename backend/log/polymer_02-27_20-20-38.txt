Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang-', '∗Corresponding author.

For PPBI/modified nanoparticles nanocomposites membranes (PPBI/modified nanocomposite consists of the PPBI and surface-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles by PVI and PSV chains and PPBI/unmodified nanocomposite includes PPBI and SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles without any treatment), the presence of ionic linkages between PPBI and silica particles can be assigned to their high Young’s modulus. Introduction of modified and un-modified nanoparticles increases the brittleness of the nanocomposite mem-branes with a decrease in their elongations at break. The effects of modified and unmodified nanoparticles on the elongations at break of the nanocomposite membranes were different. The decrease in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness were widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inorganic reinforcement [37–39]. Moreover, the ionic linkages in nanocomposite membranes prepared from modi-fied nanoparticles are higher than hydrogen bonding in PPBI/SiO2and PPBI/TiO2.', 'Fig. 14. Stress–strain curves of PPBI and nanocomposite membranes containing 10% nanoparticles.', 'H. Namazi, H. Ahmadi / Journal of Power Sources 196 (2011) 2573–25832581', 'Fig. 15. The SEM photograph of a) pure PPBI membrane and TiO2-PSV nanocomposite membranes containing of b) 5%, c) 10% and d) 15% nanoparticles.', 'The brittleness of PPBI/TiO2 based nanocomposite membranes is higher than PPBI/SiO2 ones. The brittleness of membranes pre-pared from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI are less than PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV membranes which are perhaps due to more com-patibility of PVI grafted chains onto the nanoparticles surface with PPBI backbone. ', 'Comparing the brittleness of the nanocomposite membranes of the PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/SiO2-PVI with PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, respectively indicates that the brittleness of the membranes prepared with modified SiO2 nanoparticles is less than the modified TiO2 ones.', '3.6. Morphological analysis', 'The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photographs of the PPBI/TiO2-PSV nanocomposite membranes surface with various amounts of TiO2-PSV are shown in Fig. 15. ', 'A relatively flat surface is observed for thin membranes of pure PPBI (Fig. 15(a)). Fig. 15(b–d) display surface morphological properties of nanocomposite membranes having 5, 10 and 15% of TiO2-PSV, respectively. ', 'As seen in Fig. 15, TiO2-PSV nanoparticles are dispersed homo-geneously in PPBI matrixes and are increased with increasing of the percentage of TiO2-PSV nanoparticles. Also the major amounts of nanoparticles size are in the range of nanoscale and the bigger parti-cles as evidence for the formation of aggregations are not observed.', 'The size of the TiO2-PSV particles are about 25–40 nm and the size of particles on the surface of the nanocomposite are determined to be 30–60 nm.', 'Fig. 16(a) shows the SEM micrographs of the modified SiO2nanoparticles. If the interactions between silica nanoparticles are stronger than that of between PPBI molecules and silica nanoparticles, the silica nanoparticles are agglomerated together to form silica domains in micrometer sizes. The compatibility between PPBI and unmodified nanoparticles and the homogene-ity of the PPBI/SiO2 or PPBI/TiO2 membranes are somewhat poor [32]. ', 'However, the dispersion homogeneity of silica nanoparticles in PPBI membranes could be significantly improved with using surface modified nanoparticles as the additives. As shown in Fig. 16(b), the dispersion homogeneity of modified nanoparticles is observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2 nanocomposite membrane, which demonstrates high compatibility between PPBI polymer and PSV-SiO2 nanoparticles and the high dispersion abil-ity of PSV-SiO2 in PPBI matrix. Particle agglomeration is still not observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2-10%. The ionic linkages between PPBI and modified nanoparticles are contributed to their higher compatibility [32]. However, in nanocompos-ite membranes prepared from un-modified SiO2 nanoparticles, thedispersionofthenanoparticlesinpolymermatrixis not homogenous and probably aggregation has been formed (Fig. 16(c)).', '2582H. Namazi, H. Ahmadi / Journal of Power Sources 196 (2011) 2573–2583', 'Fig. 16. SEM micrograph of SiO2-PSV (a); TEM micrographs of PPBI/SiO2-PSV-10% (b); and PPBI/SiO2-10% (c).', '4. Conclusion', 'The nanocomposite PPBI-based membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified and un-modified TiO2 and SiO2nanoparticles. The thermal stability of the prepared nanocompos-', 'ite membranes was similar to PPBI membrane. The water uptake of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from TiO2/PSV and SiO2/PSV nanoparticles were higher than other nanocomposite membranes. The acid doping level and proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes in dry conditions obtained from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI nanoparticles were the highest in comparison to PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV. Formation of nanocomposites with modified and un-modified nanoparticles resulted the increas-ing of tensile strengths. The decreasing in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness was widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inor-ganic reinforcement. The high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicated that this membrane could be utilized as a proton exchange membrane for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. M.-G.

Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang-', '∗Corresponding author.

The exis-tence of modified nanoparticles in PPBI nanocomposite membranes results in high proton conductivity in three ways:', '1) With increase in water uptake ', '2) With increase in the amount of doping level and ', '3) With increase in the number of proton conductive functional ', 'groups such as sulfonic acid group.', 'In PSV-modified nanocomposite membranes, acid doping decreases while the water uptake and the number of sulfonic acid groups shows an increase. Consequently, high proton conductiv-ity can be a result of these changes. It should be mentioned that in temperatures higher than 100 ◦C and in very low relative humidity, water uptake of PSV-modified membranes decreases which leads to low efficiency of the sulfonic groups attached onto the surface of the nanoparticles which in turn results in a decrease in proton conduc-tivity in both membranes, but the increase in proton conductivity resulting from high doping level is significant and also the proton conductivity of PVI-modified nanocomposite membranes increase in high temperatures. ', 'It is noteworthy that Nafion® 117 shows relatively low pro-ton conductivities under anhydrous conditions and almost lacks its proton conductivities at high temperatures. Comparing to Nafion®', '117 membranes, the high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicate that this membrane could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', '3.5. Mechanical properties', 'The mechanical properties of the PPBI-based membranes were measured. The stress–strain curves are shown in Fig. 14. Pristine', 'PPBI membrane showed an elongation at break of 38%. Mod-ification of nanocomposites with SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles results in an increase in the tensile strengths and a subse-quent decrease in the elongations at break for the PPBI-based membranes. For PPBI/modified nanoparticles nanocomposites membranes (PPBI/modified nanocomposite consists of the PPBI and surface-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles by PVI and PSV chains and PPBI/unmodified nanocomposite includes PPBI and SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles without any treatment), the presence of ionic linkages between PPBI and silica particles can be assigned to their high Young’s modulus. Introduction of modified and un-modified nanoparticles increases the brittleness of the nanocomposite mem-branes with a decrease in their elongations at break. The effects of modified and unmodified nanoparticles on the elongations at break of the nanocomposite membranes were different. The decrease in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness were widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inorganic reinforcement [37–39]. Moreover, the ionic linkages in nanocomposite membranes prepared from modi-fied nanoparticles are higher than hydrogen bonding in PPBI/SiO2and PPBI/TiO2.', 'Fig. 14. Stress–strain curves of PPBI and nanocomposite membranes containing 10% nanoparticles.', 'H. Namazi, H. Ahmadi / Journal of Power Sources 196 (2011) 2573–25832581', 'Fig. 15. The SEM photograph of a) pure PPBI membrane and TiO2-PSV nanocomposite membranes containing of b) 5%, c) 10% and d) 15% nanoparticles.', 'The brittleness of PPBI/TiO2 based nanocomposite membranes is higher than PPBI/SiO2 ones. The brittleness of membranes pre-pared from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI are less than PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV membranes which are perhaps due to more com-patibility of PVI grafted chains onto the nanoparticles surface with PPBI backbone. ', 'Comparing the brittleness of the nanocomposite membranes of the PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/SiO2-PVI with PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, respectively indicates that the brittleness of the membranes prepared with modified SiO2 nanoparticles is less than the modified TiO2 ones.', '3.6. Morphological analysis', 'The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photographs of the PPBI/TiO2-PSV nanocomposite membranes surface with various amounts of TiO2-PSV are shown in Fig. 15. ', 'A relatively flat surface is observed for thin membranes of pure PPBI (Fig. 15(a)). Fig. 15(b–d) display surface morphological properties of nanocomposite membranes having 5, 10 and 15% of TiO2-PSV, respectively. ', 'As seen in Fig. 15, TiO2-PSV nanoparticles are dispersed homo-geneously in PPBI matrixes and are increased with increasing of the percentage of TiO2-PSV nanoparticles. Also the major amounts of nanoparticles size are in the range of nanoscale and the bigger parti-cles as evidence for the formation of aggregations are not observed.', 'The size of the TiO2-PSV particles are about 25–40 nm and the size of particles on the surface of the nanocomposite are determined to be 30–60 nm.', 'Fig. 16(a) shows the SEM micrographs of the modified SiO2nanoparticles. If the interactions between silica nanoparticles are stronger than that of between PPBI molecules and silica nanoparticles, the silica nanoparticles are agglomerated together to form silica domains in micrometer sizes. The compatibility between PPBI and unmodified nanoparticles and the homogene-ity of the PPBI/SiO2 or PPBI/TiO2 membranes are somewhat poor [32]. ', 'However, the dispersion homogeneity of silica nanoparticles in PPBI membranes could be significantly improved with using surface modified nanoparticles as the additives. As shown in Fig. 16(b), the dispersion homogeneity of modified nanoparticles is observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2 nanocomposite membrane, which demonstrates high compatibility between PPBI polymer and PSV-SiO2 nanoparticles and the high dispersion abil-ity of PSV-SiO2 in PPBI matrix. Particle agglomeration is still not observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2-10%. The ionic linkages between PPBI and modified nanoparticles are contributed to their higher compatibility [32]. However, in nanocompos-ite membranes prepared from un-modified SiO2 nanoparticles, thedispersionofthenanoparticlesinpolymermatrixis not homogenous and probably aggregation has been formed (Fig. 16(c)).', '2582H. Namazi, H. Ahmadi / Journal of Power Sources 196 (2011) 2573–2583', 'Fig. 16. SEM micrograph of SiO2-PSV (a); TEM micrographs of PPBI/SiO2-PSV-10% (b); and PPBI/SiO2-10% (c).', '4. Conclusion', 'The nanocomposite PPBI-based membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified and un-modified TiO2 and SiO2nanoparticles. The thermal stability of the prepared nanocompos-', 'ite membranes was similar to PPBI membrane. The water uptake of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from TiO2/PSV and SiO2/PSV nanoparticles were higher than other nanocomposite membranes. The acid doping level and proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes in dry conditions obtained from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI nanoparticles were the highest in comparison to PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV. Formation of nanocomposites with modified and un-modified nanoparticles resulted the increas-ing of tensile strengths. The decreasing in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness was widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inor-ganic reinforcement. The high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicated that this membrane could be utilized as a proton exchange membrane for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. M.-G.

For diverse goals, polymers have', 'been used either as homopolymers, blends of homopolymers, copolymers, or as chemically modified homo- or copolymers. Nowadays, nearly all industries resort to the use of polymeric materials, in one way or another, insofar their intrinsic properties would be sought for. As known, such properties are partly contingent to the chemical featuring of the polymer, i.e., the chemical binding nature, the organic functional groups, the way these functional groups are linked and the way they are spatially disposed (tacticity)[1].

Mostly, the moieties that secure the properties for such applications are chemical organic/organometallic groups either embedded or covalently anchored onto polymer matrixes, their branches/arms, or their ends. To this end, the latter alternative, that is the covalent attach-ment, is considered the best route as the affixed group would be an integral part of the polymer. Such finished materials can be achieved by conventional chemical reactions, involving the virgin polymer and the modifying molecule. One of the require-ments for the success of such functionalization is the chemical reactivity of the polymer through the existing functional groups. There has been an escalating interest in functionalized polymers as supports, reagents, and catalysts immobilizing[8,9]. ', 'Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), a ubiquitous industrial polymer, is distinguished by its properties and applications[10–12]. Starting materials and methods of its synthesis and applica-tions were utterly described[12]. A recent synthesis of PVA with controlled molecular weight and high syndiotacticity using reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization was reported[13]. By its simple structure, PVA has drawn the attention of researchers along its history because of its readiness to chemical reaction via its secondary alcohol functionality[12]. In addition, the latter group would account for its solubility in water and organic polar solvents. Its water solubility feature consolidates its superiority as far as environ-ment and green chemistries are nowadays of great concern. The merits of PVA and PVA derivatives lie on their unique biocompatibility, proving their spread uses in biomedicals as embolic material[14], orthopedic applications[15,16], and others[17]. On the other hand, PVA served as embedding matrix and mat for metallic nanoparticles such as silver nitrate for hydrogen sensor[18] and antibacterial activity[19–21], and supporting film for Co/Ag nanoparticles[22]. The nanofibers of Fe(III)-complexed PVA were efficient in removing arsenic ions [As(III) and As(V)] from water[23]. PVA coating for cobalt ferrite nanoparticles CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) imparted their toxicity lowering[24]. ', 'Accounts of the functionalization of PVA along with their appropriate applications, up to 2008, were reported[12,25]. From then, PVA has known an increasing attention as to its applica-tions in its functionalized states, and we deemed important and timely to account for with critical discussion. In this review, it is confined mostly to covalent chemical transformation of PVA, giving rise to soluble materials. Yet, the cross-linking could be invoked if necessary for specific applications, provid-ing that the right and coveted modification has been appropri-ately made. In some instances, PVA is taken as the functionalizing agent for modifying macromolecules other than linear polymers. Practically, the modification process can occur either on the bulk of PVA (i.e., in solution), or on cross-linked one, or on PVA surface. ', 'Both conventional and novel chemistries have been applied to transform PVA through chemical bonds setting, giving rise', 'to some novel properties and applications for the virgin polymer. The secondary alcohol functionality is obviously expected to be the preferential reaction site because of its propensity to react under classical chemistry (Eq. 1). The phy-sico-chemical properties and the application extents of the func-tionalized PVA hinge on the functionalization advance, that is, the substitution degree of hydroxyl groups. Truly noting, the thus-modified PVA is actually a terpolymer consisting of three monomeric units: vinyl acetate (the mother monomeric unit), vinyl alcohol (the hydrolysis resulting monomeric unit), and the vinyl with new functional group (the functionalized vinyl alcohol unit). In some instances and purposely, the newly anchored group can be subjected to further functionalization for specific targets. It is noteworthy to mention that PVA has been viewed as a functionalizing agent for other materials to create, for example, a hydrophilic environment. On the other hand, and because of its reputed properties, not only has PVA been subjected to functionalization but also it has been served as modifying agent to many materials for various purposes. For example, its biocompatibility and biodegradability are highly appreciated when designing biomedical systems. It is worthy of note that, in the last decade, reports on the functiona-lization all allotropic carbons and derivatives [carbon black, graphite, fullerenes, carbon nanotubes (CNT), graphene, and graphene oxide (GO)] by PVA are distinctly widespread. Also, polymers of different kinds were functionalized with PVA to produce graft copolymers, cross-linked materials and copoly-mers that look like star copolymers, comb copolymers, and brush copolymers. Functionalization of materials of low molecular weights such as b-cyclodextrin with PVA was accomplished. Hence, in the first place, functionalization of PVA is delineated in parallel with their applications as mem-brane fuel cells (MFCs), biological and biomedicals, adsorption and separation, and catalysis in chemical reactions. In the second place, miscellaneous functionalizations and applications are structured under polymeric grafting, click chemistry, and chemical linkages such as ester, urethane, and ether.', 'Eq. (1)', 'MEMBRANE FUEL CELLS ', 'Membrane fuel cells are evaluated as an alternative tech-nology for the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy[26]. Polymers, including PVA, have been the indispens-able mats for developing such ongoing technology. Nafion stands as the standard polymer for MFCs.

Cross-linking with 30 wt% PVA took place only at temperatures higher than 100°C, affording black-colored membranes with defied insolubility. The degree of cross-linking fluctuated between 18 and 38%. The ion-exchange capacity (IEC) of the cross-linked S-PPESK/PVA membranes was estimated to be 0.88–1.85mmol g�1, depending on the PVA content. Water uptake and swelling ratio of the membrane declined with greater PVA content. At 80°C, they were measured to be about 110 and 35%, respectively, for 15% PVA, and were 45 and 5% for 35% PVA. Also, the proton conductivity decreased with increasing PVA content, from 2.00�10�2 to ∼0.8 S cm�1. ', 'In the aim of elaborating Nafion composite membranes for direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), the surface of nanofibers (diameter ¼ 200–300 nm) of porous PVA mats made by electrospinning technique were acetalized with 4-formyl-1,3-benzenedisulfonic acid under acidic catalysis at 60°C for 2 h[28]. The acetalized PVA was cross-linked with glutaraldehyde to be used in the composite formulation. The apparent conduc-tivity of the Nafion/functionalized PVA composite membrane was lower than that of pure Nafion at all temperatures and thicknesses. The IEC of the composite membrane was inde-pendent of the membrane thickness and varied from 0.33 to 0.58 Eq kg�1 that of Nafion was almost twice (0.93 Eq kg�1). While the conductivity rose linearly with membrane thickness for Nafion, it increased up to ∼47 lm and decreased beyond for the composite membrane. Tseng et al.[29], however, evalu-ated the PVA acetalized with 4-formyl-1,3-benzenedisulfonic acid and cross-linked with both 1,3-bis(3-glycidyloxypropyl) tetramethyldisiloxane and 4,40-oxydiphthalic anhydride as PEMs for DMFC applications. The water uptake, the IEC, and the proton conductivity decreased as the cross-linking density increased from 3 to 50 wt%; water uptake from ∼140 to ∼50%; and IEC from ∼2.5 to ∼1 mEq kg�1. The cross-linking enhanced the oxidative stability of the mem-brane. A positive temperature effect on the proton conductivity was observed. The proton conductivity of the membrane with 3% cross-linking was measured to be 0.218 S cm�1 at 70°C, a conductivity higher than that of Nafion 117 (0.127 S cm�1).

It was claimed that ODADS was indeed part of the PVA matrix without indicating how. Yet, we believe that, under the described experimental conditions (Eq. 2), an esteri-fication could have occurred between one of the sulfonic groups and hydroxyl group of PVA. The Tgs of ODADS-PVA membranes were in the range the of 71–96°C, and increased with increasing ODADS content; the Tg of pure PVA was 85°C. The highest proton conductivity, 16.53 mS cm�1, was observed for an ODADS content of 20 wt% and at 30°C, the highest water uptake (98.65%) and methanol permeability (7.70 �10�10 mol cm�1 s�1) were measured for an ODADS content of 10 wt%.', 'Eq.

The other PEM factors of the PVA-g-GO/S-PVA membrane, IEC, water uptake, proton conductivity, and methanol permeability decreased with increasing PVA-g-GO from 0 to 10 wt% because of the stronger acidity of the sulfonic acid group: 0.655–0.545 mEq g�1, 154–49%, 0.0206–0.0097 S cm�1, 5.4 �10�7 to 1.53 �10�7 cm2 s�1, respectively.

Hydrogels made by inducing cross-linking of the trimellitate PVA solution in DMF with ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether at 70°C for 24 h showed a salting-in effect (anti-Hofmeister property). This was demonstrated by immersing the gel into Na2SO4 solution; a water content in the gel attained 98%. General findings were the salting-in effect was observed in this order of anions andcations:SO2�4> SCN�> Cl�and Liþ > Naþ > Kþ, an anti-Hofmeister order. ', 'Functionalization of graphene forms with polymers was well-documented by Salavagione and his group[126]. Graphene sheets could not be functionalized but could be dispersed with polymer matrix to produce materials with better properties such as mechanical ones[127]; indeed, the presence of 1.8 vol.% of graphene within PVA (MW ¼ 100 kDa) engendered a nanocomposite with 150% increase in tensile strength, 73% increase in Young’s modulus, and a 220% decrease in strain at break. However, oxidation of grahene, commonly with nitric acid, renders it chemically reactive, known as gra-phene oxide. GO contains oxygenated functions including hydroxyl, epoxy, ketone, and carboxyl groups. The latter groups were exploited in the functionalization of GO with PVA by esterification. This esterification is usually activated using DCC. Nanocomposites were fashioned by incorporating PVA-functionalized graphene oxide (PVA-g-GO) in propor-tions as low as 0.5–2 wt% to pure PVA[128]. The PVA-g-GO were prepared by reacting GO nanosheets (1.5–2.0 nm in thickness) with PVA (MW ¼ 61 kDa, Hy ¼ 98.8–98%) in DMSO using DCC and DMAP as catalysts, at 50°C for 3 days (Eq. 25). The grafting efficiency was about 30%. The Tg, Tm, and Tc of the PVA-grafted GO/PVA nanocomposites were greater than those of PVA, 74.5–80.3°C, 220.4–223°C, and 198.4–203.5°C, respectively, against 72.2°C, 211.8°C, and 196°C. The Tg increase was reasoned as to be due to the reduced mobility of PVA chains by the PVA-g-GO rigid nanofiller. Better thermal stability of the nanocomposites vis-à-vis pristine PVA and GO was observed. The mechanical properties (tensile strength, Young’s modulus, elongation at break) of the As-prepared nanocomposites were superior to those of virgin PVA: ∼32–46 MPa, ∼0.25–0.53 GPa, ∼147–167%,respectively,against∼23 MPa,∼0.16 GPa, ∼130%; the account for such observation is the strong interfa-cial affinity between PVA-g-GO and PVA matrix, resulting from the existing hydrogen-bonding and their better misci-bility. Veca et al.[129] applied the same carbodiimide-activated esterification to the functionalization of carbon nanosheets (5 nm in thickness) with 2 mol% of carboxylic groups with PVA (MW ¼ 70–90 kDa) as in Eq. (26). The PVA-grafted carbon nanosheet was easily dispersed in DMSO and hot water. Its Tg was 90°C, higher than that of PVA (70°C), which', '1310S. MOULAY', 'was explained in terms of mobility reduction of the PVA chains upon appending to graphene layers.', 'Eq. (26)', 'Hu and his coworkers[130] studied the dielectric properties of nanocomposites consisting of GO in its reduced form. The synthesized PVA-g-GO (25 wt% PVA) was subjected to the reduction with hydrazine affording (PVA-g-GOred). The latter hybrid material was more thermally stable than PVA and PVA-g-GO. The nanocomposites consisting of poly (vinylidene fluoride)/PVA-g-GOred were of high dielectric constant (230) and low loss factor (0.5) at the imposed frequency. ', 'Grafting of PVA on graphene was reported to be induced by ultrasonic irradiation[131]. The heterogeneous mixture of PVA (MW ¼ 146–186 kDa, Hy ¼ 99%) and graphene (∼1.2 nm in thickness) in water was subjected to ultrasonic irradiation (300 W) for 2 h, where PVA chains were broken homolyti-cally. The PVA macroradicals would attack the graphene layers at the sp2 hybridized carbons and via the “grafting to” strategy, giving rise to PVA-g-graphene. This nanomaterial (∼3.8 nm in thickness) contained about 35 wt% PVA. It was readily dispersed in water, a dispersion that has been stable for two months at room temperature, and resulted in an insoluble black precipitate upon pouring into an excess of THF. The films cast from a mixture of PVA-g-graphene were homogeneous and with enhanced mechanical properties: a tensile strength of 98 MPa and a Young’s modulus of 5.2 GPa, and those of PVA were 56 MPa and 3.4 GPa, respect-ively. However, their strain at break and crystallinity extent were lower: 38 and 22% against 50 and 32%, respectively. ', 'Salavagione et al.[132] esterified GO with PVA through carboxylic and acyl chloride functionalities, GO-COOH and GO-COCl. The PVA-g-GO materials, obtained with low degrees of grafting (1.8%), were soluble in hot water and hot DMSO. The conspicuous bands of GO in the Raman spectrum of PVA-g-GO’s appeared at 1320 and 1596 cm�1. Also, analysis revealed that the esterification took place at the isotactic configuration of PVA. The crystallinity degree of the latter decreased upon grafting to 0.51% without melting point. 35 and 12°C increases in the glass transition temperature', 'were observed for PVA-g-GO from GO-COOH and PVAOCl, respectively; graphene layers would have impeded the mobility of PVA chains.', 'Surfaces of carboxylated multwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT-COOH) obtained by nitric acid treatment were modified by esterification with PVA at 140°C for 3 days[133], producing a MWCNT-PVA hybrid as a black solid. Some changes in morphology for MWCNT-PVA were noticed upon standing for seven days in Tris-HCl buffer solution (2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-propane-1,3-diol); no changes in microstructure and morphology occurred for MWCNT and MWCNT-COOH.Moreover,thedissolutionofPVA-g-MWCNT started at the 21st day of dispersion and the analysis by HR-TEM (High-resolution transmission electron microscopy) showed that the CNT layers were decomposed to amorphous car-bonaceous debris. Fu and Gu[134] fabricated composite fibers from PVA-g-MWCNT and PVA by gel spinning and hot-drawing processes. The drawn PVA-g-MWCNT/PVA fibers, obtained with a degree of crystallinity of 69.2%, exhibited bet-ter mechanical properties than pure PVA ones: tensile strength of 2.1 GPa, Young’s modulus of 34.1GPa, and elongation of 10.3% against 1.2 GPa, 25.2GPa, and 10.5%. ', 'GO nanosheets and PVA films could be assembled layer-by-layer (LBL) through hydrogen-bonding interaction to form novel materials with the brick-and-mortar arrangement[135]. The LBL structure of these (PVA/GO)n nanocomposites was successfully confirmed by several analytical techniques, including XRD, XPS, FESEM, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The thick-ness of a bilayer was found to be about 3 nm. The mechanical properties of (PVA/GO)300, elastic modulus and hardness, were improved vis-à-vis those of pure PVA: 17.64 GPa and 1.15GPa, respectively, against 8.88GPa and 0.34GPa; that is, 98.7 and 240.4% increases in elastic modulus and hardness, respectively.', 'Functionalization Through Urethane (or Carbamate) ', 'Linkage ', 'Via urethane linkage, maleimidophenyl entity was covalently incorporated into PVA matrix as illustrated in Eq.

The realization of such modification was to carry out the', 'FUNCTIONALIZATIONS OF POLY(VINYL ALCOHOL)1311', 'reaction of PVA (molecular weight MW ¼ 67–85 kDa, Hy ¼ 98%) with 4-maleimidophenyl isocyanate in DMF at 60°C and in the presence of DBTL as catalyst. The optimal substi-tution degree was about 35%. The maleimidophenyl groups affected the thermal behavior of the pristine PVA; the glass transition temperature Tg dropped from 57 to 40°C, suggesting a softening that resulted from the hydrogen bonds breaking. A thermal curing of maleimide groups was observed at about 230–260°C. Mechanical properties were also affected by the presence of maleimidophenyl; the storage modulus at 20°C increased from 1.68 (PVA) to 2.85 GPa (PVA modified with about 12% of maleimidophenyl groups), the Young’s modulus from 1.16 to 1.86 GPa, and the tensile strength decreased from 65 to 57 MPa.', 'Eq. (27)', 'Moreno and et al.[137] introduced isocyanate function on PVA by means of a urethane linkage to end up with a novel additive for lubricants. To do so, the protection of a number of hydroxyl groups of PVA (MW ¼ 9–10 kDa, Hy ¼ 80%) was imposed via pyranylation with 3,4-dihydro-2-H-pyran (with a degree of pyranylation of about 45%), and the remaining hydroxyl groups were allowed to react with hexamethylenediisocyanate in DMF and in the presence of DBTL as catalyst, for 12 h at room temperature (Eq. 28). The highest degree of urethanation achieved was about 70%, and the ensued functionalized PVA was thermally stable up to 325°C. The measured rheological properties of the lubricant formulation using this pyranylated-isocyanated PVA as addi-tive were enhanced.', 'Eq. (28)', 'Poly(vinyl alcohol) underwent also modification by reac-tion with phenyl isothiocyanate[138], resulting in copolymer of vinyl alcohol and vinyl phenylthionecarbamate. The feature of this undertaking was that the reaction was microwave assisted (600 W and 2.45 GHz) and solvent free, and was accomplished in 6 min at 125°C (Eq. 29). The conventional procedure, that is the reaction in organic solvent at 170°C for 15 min, was disadvantaged by several flaws namely the readiness of the phenyl isothiocyanate to hydrolysis to give 1,3-diphenylthiourea (viaWohler-like reaction), and the insolubility of the copolymer obtained in organic solvents. In the environmentally friendly conditions, the yield was about 42% and the degree of functionalization was 60%.', 'Eq. (29)', 'Carbamation of PVA with octyl isocyanate in tri-n-buty-lethylphosphoniumdiethylphosphate(TBEP-DEP)was straightforward as a reaction time for quantitative modification was longer (2 days at 90°C) and required the use of a catalyst (DBTL)[121]. The urethanation in BMIM-Cl, however, seemed not to occur. Such difference in reaction behavior was linked to the capacity of the surface tension lowering of the modify-ing agent/ionic liquid/PVA solution.', 'Functionalization Through Ether Linkage ', 'Poly(vinyl alcohol) can be modified by setting ether and silyl ether groups via its hydroxyl groups. One way to incorporate an ether functionality is through the reaction of the latter hydroxyl groups with an epoxy group-containing functionalizing agent, leading to an oxirane opening. To bring about some hydrophobic character to PVA and to improve its surface activity, Wang and his co-workers[139] undertook the quaternization with a series of glycidyl-N-alkyl-N,N-dimethyl-ammonium chloride having fatty alkyl groups of different lengths (octyl, dodecyl, hexadecyl, octadecyl) (See Eq. (21) above). The grafting extent ranged between 6.23 and 9.96%. Mechanical results showed that the increase in grafting ratio led to a PVA toughening. The elongation at break was ∼495% for PVA quaternized with 9.96% of glycidyl-N-dodecyl-N,N-dimethyl-ammonium and that of innate PVA was lower than 50%. The Tg decreased with the alkyl chain length, from 64°C for unfunctionalized PVA to 35.18°C for quaternized PVA with glycidyl-N-octadecyl-N,N-dimethyl-ammonium.

', 'The propensity of alcohol to react with aldehyde, affording acetal functionality, has been widely exploited in PVA cross-linking with a dialdehyde molecule such as glutaraldehyde, nowadays for preparing PVA-based hydrogels. Fernández et al.[140] addressed the feasibility of making poly(vinyl acetal)s that contain electron-donating groups by modification of PVA (MW ¼ 108 kDa, Hy ¼ 98.8%) in homogeneous system using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as solvent. The mono-aldehydes studied were 1-naphthaldehyde, 9-anthraldehyde, 9-ethyl-3-carbazolecarboxaldehyde and the modification reac-tions were run at 40°C for 3–7 h in the presence of Bronstëd acid to catalyze the condensations (Eq. 30). Optimal reaction conditions yielded moderate acetalization degrees, 45–57%; the acetalization degree with 1-naphthaldehyde reached 81% when the reaction time was prolonged to 4 days, at a tempera-ture of 60°C and with the use of an excess of aldehyde. The glass transition temperatures of acetalized PVAs increased almost linearly with increasingdegree ofacetalization. While the acetalization of PVA with 1-naphthaldehyde and 9-ethyl-3-carbazolecarboxaldehyde did not alter significantly the thermal stability of the pristine PVA, that with 9-anthralde-hyde did but adversely.', 'Eq. (30)', 'Delattreetal.[141]undertookathoroughstudyof acetalization of PVA of different MW’s and Hy’s with a number of aldehydes, including aromatics (benzaldehyde and naphthaldehyde and their derivatives) and aliphatics (decanal, undecanal and octanal and their derivatives) in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid. All prepared poly(acetal)s were obtained in moderate to high yields and were soluble in THF and other polar organic solvents. The acetalization extent with benzaldehyde was solvent and temperature dependent; the optimal functionalization was in the range of 72% either in DMSO or acetonitrile (MeCN) or in DMSO/MeCN system at 60°C for 1 h. The effect of the nature of the substituent in', 'the benzene ring on the functionalization was clear; the elec-tron-withdrawing groups enhanced it and the electron-donating ones depressed it. Among the aliphatic aldehydes that afforded high acetalization (68–80%) were decanal, undecanal, 2-methyl-undecanal, octyl-dodecanal, and 3,7-dimethyl-octanal. Also, the modification degree was 68% for 1-naphtaldehyde and 80% for 2-naphtaldehyde and phenylacetaldehyde. While high acetalization was not hampered by high molecular weight of the pristine PVA but it was by the hydrolysis degree; PVAs with 15 to 20% of residual acetate groups could be fully functionalized, whereas those with Hy > 90% could not be acetalized. Some of these poly(acetals) could be viewed as additives in some cosmetic formulations such as nail polish and lipstick, as they provide some glossy property. Indeed, glossy measurements put those bearing naphthyl groups in front.', 'Functionalization via Click Chemistry ', 'PVA with terminal azide groups (PVA-N3(t)) was made by hydrolysis of poly(vinyl acetate), obtained from xanthate-mediatedRAFTpolymerizationofvinylacetateusing S-(4-azidomethylbenzyl)-O-(2-methoxyethyl)xanthate[142].

The grafted polystyrene was of a molecular weight of MW ¼ 26 kDa and a polydisper-sity index PDI of 1.6. XRD analysis confirmed the reducing effect of grafted polystyrene on the crystallinity of PVA by disruption of its intermolecular hydrogen bonding.', 'Eq. (33)', 'Graft copolymer of PVA and poly(lactic acid) was made by polymerizi ng L-lactic acid (LLA) or lactide in the presence', 'of PVA (MW ¼ 86 kDa, Hy ¼ 99%) in ethyl acetate using stannous 2-ethyl hexanoate as catalyst at 120°C for 24 h (Eq. 34)[145]. Quantitative yields, up to 95%, were reached. Copolymers with less than 50 wt% of LLA showed a Tg in the range of 78°C, approaching that of PVA (78.5°C), but those with higher LLA content were of lower Tgs, 22–59°C. Their Tms were 217–228°C, lower than that of PVA. The tensile strength, the elongation at break, and the Young’s modulus of the graft copolymer varied with lactic acid content but nonsystematically; for 66 wt% content, they were 30.3 MPa, 191.4%, and 892.9 MPa, respectively. To make a hydrogel based on this graft copolymer, the grafting reaction was run in DMF/toluene and at 150°C, a critical temperature for the hydrogel formation. The different inherent hydrogel factors were drawn from dynamic swelling measurements in water and for the hydrogel PLLA-g-PVA with 66 wt% of LLA they were as: 2.55 in swelling ratio, 0.502 in transport exponent, 2.10 �10�7 cm2 s�1 in diffusion coefficient; the value of the transport exponent hinted at a Fickian diffusion, and that of diffusion coefficient was lower than the one for PVA hydrogel. In the same year, Wang and his group[146]', 'reported the grafting of poly(lactic acid) on PVA (DP ¼ 1700, Hy ¼ 99%) by conducting the graft polyesterification in melt in the presence of SnCl2 �H2O as catalyst. The following para-meters were obtained at a temperature of 95°C, for a reaction time of 6 h, and for a catalyst concentration of 0.5 wt%: degree of substitution (DS) of 60%, degree of polymerization (DP) of grafted PLA of 1.86. The Tg and Tm were measured as 64.4, and 219°C, respectively, values lower than those of PVA (81 and 230°C), which may have resulted from the breaking of the hydrogen bonding of PVA, giving rise to a higher mobility. The mechanical properties were 10.6 MPa (tensile strength) and 266% (elongation at break), compared to those of the functionalized PVA were 75 MPa and 5%. These results would suggest that the oligo-PLLA grafts served as internal plasticizer for PVA polymer. The graft copolymer with DS of 60% and DP of 1.86 was partially soluble in water at 100°C and insoluble at lower temperatures, and its water resistance was high implying its good use in food packaging. The oligo-PLLA chains reduced the hydrophilicity of PVA. Later, the same group[147] extended their investigation on the effect of oligomers of LLA on the rheological behavior of PVA. To this end, a mixture of a 1:1 blend of two types of PVA (MW ¼ 1.7 kDa, Hy ¼ 99%; MW ¼ 0.5 kDa, Hy ¼ 88%) and L-lactic acid was subjected to melt polyesterification using SnCl2 �H2O as catalyst, affording copolymers of PVA and LLA. The degree of grafting could attain 29% and the DP of PLLA oligomers was in the range of 1.90. Besides the impact of the molecular weight of PVA, the PLLA grafting led to a melt viscosity lowering, a rise in non-Newtonian or flow index (n) and viscous flow activation energy and, overall, an enhancement of the melting flow processing. The flow index (n) ranged between 0.24 and 0.40 at 160°C, and decreased with increasing of PLLA grafting.', '1314S. MOULAY', 'Eq.

As conventional plastics degrade in the environment, their decomposition has been known to produce microplastics.4 These materials have already affected global soils, which cycle further into the water, air, and atmosphere, and into our food chain.4 Conventional plastics such as low density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polystyrene (PS), are non-biodegradable and have been shown to remain in the environment in various forms for over 450 years.5,6', 'In addition, single-use petrochemical plastic use has con-tinued to increase, particularly in recent years during the COVID-19 pandemic by reliance on plastic disposable items for safety and hygienic purposes.7 In addition, it has been reported that over 20 million metric tons of plastic waste, or 11% of the total plastic waste generated, directly entered aquatic ecosystems around the globe in 2016, with that numberpredictedtonearlydoubleby2030.6Nearly 400 million metric tons of plastic are annually produced worldwide as of 2023 from raw petrochemical feedstocks.2,8', 'The management of this waste generated from raw feedstock has led to compounded economic, environmental, and health safety challenges.8–10 For instance, only a small fraction of the total amount of virgin plastic, ranging from 5–30%, is available for re-purposing or recycled for further use. This in turn gener-ates a loss of up to 95% of the original economic value for the material.5,9,11–14', 'This has led to much economic opportunities lost for a potential circular “bio-plastic” economy. Even with increasing global efforts to manage plastic waste pollution, ongoing studies of the complex social, economic, and scientific issues of plastic waste management indicate that predicted growth in plastic waste generation exceeds current efforts for mitigating overall plastic pollution.6,15 These results indicate that urgent', 'transformative changes in both materials design and policies are needed to help address this crisis.2,8,14,16', 'These ongoing concerns have generated strong interest in biologically sourced and biodegradable polymers as alterna-tives to conventional plastics. One model for potential future materials use includes the ultimate goal of creating a more cir-cular, sustainable plastic economy in which the idea of waste is re-imagined.4 In this model of bio-based plastic substitutes, the waste products of end-of-life biopolymers can ultimately be re-used as raw feedstocks, as opposed to a more linear model, such as with conventional plastic, in which the material is simply unusable with current recycling infrastructure and technology or otherwise discarded.17–21', 'Polyhydroxyalkanotes (PHAs) are one example of a family of biologically produced polyesters that have been extensively investigated for their benefits as plastic alternatives.22–26 These well-known biopolymer materials, first developed in the early 20th century, are synthesized and accumulate in microbes in the presence of excess carbon sources and nutrients, acting as an energy storage mechanism.27,28 PHAs have often been selected and utilized as a model biologically-sourced polyester for their attractive and versatile qualities. Some of these qual-ities include robust biocompatibility, non-toxic degradation products, and chemical tunability. In addition, PHAs also have a unique opportunity to be recycled or reused by both chemi-cal and biological means at the end of their life cycle for further use.1,23,26,29,30', 'In addition, PHAs have been known to degrade effectively in aquatic and soil-based environments during both enzymatic and hydrolytic degradation.10,30 One recent study by Omura and colleagues examined a series of commercially available biodegradable and non-biodegradable plastic materials at different ocean depths, in both coastal and deep-sea floor environments, and PHA materials and copolymers were shown todecomposeeffectivelywithspecificmicroorganisms.10', 'These findings have generated interest in developing PHA materials with potential to be decomposed as soon as they are discharged into the ocean, with many new and exciting oppor-tunities for PHA development.10', 'Despite the considerable potential offered by PHAs towards enabling a transition away from conventional fossil fuel-based plastic, the existing industrial scale commercial production and distribution of these biopolymers has remained somewhat limited.29,31,32 At present, there are several enterprises that produce PHAs worldwide, including BioMatera (Canada), BiomeBioplastics(UnitedKingdom),Biomer(Germany), CardiaBioplastics(Australia),DanimerScientific(USA), Kaneka (Japan), Full Cycle Bioplastics (USA), Mango Materials (USA),Nafigate(CzechRepublic),NaturePlast(France), Newlight Technologies (USA), Tianjin GreenBio Materials (China), Yield10 Bioscience (USA and Canada), and Tianan Biologic Material (China).27,33,34', 'Some of the current major limitations of PHA production on an industrial scale include availability of appropriate feed-stocks, low productivity, accumulation, and yield, as well as a complex system of microorganism genetic engineering and', 'Babetta L.

', 'Moreover, while the diversity of verified types of PHAs is extensive, the amount of commercially produced PHAs is rather limited, with available polymers and copolymers largely constrained to a narrow set of chemistries that are dominated by polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), otherwise known as poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (or P3HB). PHB the most commonly commer-cially available PHA.27,31 Other commonly available copolymers of PHB include poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (typically written as PHBV or P3HB3HV) and poly(3-hydroxybu-tyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHHx).27,40,41', 'The limited chemical diversity and tunability exhibited by commercially available PHAs also result in materials selection and design challenges.42 Specifically, the narrow and often unsuitable range of thermal processing windows and mechani-cal properties, and limited degradation rates which are some-times comparable to other less expensive biopolymers such as polylactic acid (PLA) pose great hurdles for PHAs towards their use in a range of applications.29,43 Currently, this renders PHAs either unsuitable or too expensive to be realistic alterna-tives to traditional plastics.20,44–46', 'However, despite their expense, PHAs still offer many unique advantages in terms of biodegradability, compostabil-ity and non-toxicity, and potential for long-term sustainability in commercial use when compared to more widespread plastic alternatives available today.47,48 While these hurdles pose sig-nificant and interdependent challenges to widespread PHA use, they also present unique opportunities from both research and economic perspectives to understand and improve the overall PHA materials design paradigm for this class of materialsaswellasothercommerciallylimited biopolymers.16,19,23', 'When addressing materials design challenges such as those currently faced by PHAs, one central materials science frame-work relates the properties, structure, processing, and perform-ance (PSPP) of a material in interconnected pair-wise relation-ships epitomized by the classic materials tetrahedron, as shown in Fig. 1. The concept of PSPP relationships has been extensively applied to many areas of materials science ranging from alloy design to perovskites and heterogeneous catalysis to pharmaceuticals, but remains relatively less explored in the context of bio-derived polymer design, in general, and for PHA-based biopolymer design, specifically.49,50', 'The materials tetrahedron has also been recently re-ima-gined in a contemporary, information science-focused perspec-', 'tive. This new perspective on a classic paradigm also aims to reduce the overall time and cost to discover and develop new materials by re-establishing the tetrahedron as a framework for novel design principles.51 It is well established that the PSPP relationships are particularly suitable for developing and examining quantifiable relationships between an available material’s structure and its potential properties, as well as in connecting its processing history to the target performance.51', 'Therefore, there is potential to both explore and improve the scientific understanding of these relationships as well as enhance the commercial PHA design space by using a well-known PSPP framework and establishing it in an inno-vative way towards biopolymer identification, design, and development. ', 'In traditional implementations of the materials science tetrahedron, the structure, property, processing, and perform-ance parameters have been essential. Each of the branches of the tetrahedron provide a framework to not only understand their interconnected nature, but also has been historically used in the rational design and optimization of novel and existing materials in other areas of materials science.51,52 In this review, we have surveyed these PSPP relationships in the context of PHA biopolymers by examining current state-of-the-art examples of ongoing research. ', 'Here, we apply this PSPP relationship framework to under-stand and highlight the scope of the underlying chemical space, outstanding design challenges, conflicting trends in properties, as well as current limitations and potential for future improvements in the broad research area of PHA biopo-lymers that have the potential to utilize modern experimental approaches. Our work also establishes a precedent for other types of biopolymers to be examined in a similar, materials-centric, design-focused way.', '2Control of PHA structure', '2.1Chemical and morphological structure of PHAs', 'At the most fundamental level, the chemical structure of a polymer is dictated by the atomic constituents forming the monomers and their connections. Monomers of one or more types can then combine in a backbone and side chain in different compositions to form either homopolymers (made up entirely of one monomer type) or copolymers (made up of several different monomers). For a given composition, the rela-tive placement of different monomers along the polymer back-bone can further give rise to different copolymer microstruc-tures (for instance, random, block or alternate) resulting in qualitatively different interchain interactions. These inter-actions in turn dictate how closely the polymer chains are packed together, giving rise to the overall mesoscopic morpho-logical structure.53', 'Therefore, the overall structure in polymers, including PHAs, which are in general linear, aliphatic polyesters, is largely governed by: (1) the intrinsic chemical nature of the building blocks at the atomic-scale, (2) non-bonding inter-', 'Polymer ChemistryReview', 'This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2025Polym.

For instance, the addition of another carbon in the main backbone chain of the structure will change the PHA monomer from 3HB to 4HB, while the addition of another carbon in the side chain of the structure will change the PHA monomer from 3HB to 3HV. Thus, the number of carbons in both the backbone and side chain of the structure itself will affect the type of PHA monomer that is pro-duced. Additionally, changing the functional group in the side chain of the structure will also affect the monomer: for instance, the inclusion of a phenyl group in the side chain of the structure will change the PHA monomer from 3HV to 3H4PhB. These changes in the monomer will also affect the typeofpolymerandcopolymerblocksthatmaybe synthesized. ', 'There is a separate, alternative classification terminology system that is frequently employed to address different types of PHAs on the basis of the number of carbon atoms in the backbone and side chain itself. These classifications include a PHA with backbone and side chains of less than 5 carbons, short-chain length (scl), and those with the number of back-bone and side chains between 6–14, medium-chain length (mcl),or evenlonger carbonchains,long-chainlength (lcl).40,64–66 In addition, it is known that due to their method of biological synthesis and fermentation, PHAs formed by natural means are strictly isotactic and feature only (R)-con-', 'figurations in their chiral stereocenter in the main carbon backbone of the polyester chain, but some variations have been synthesised by synthetic means.27', 'Each of these structural components have been demon-strated to have unique effects on the PHA polymer properties, affectingeverythingfromitscrystallinitytoits thermo-mechanical properties and degradation rate. An example of this behavior can be observed in the case of polyhydroxyvale-rate. This polymer is also written and abbreviated as poly(3-hydroxyvalerate), PHV, and P3HV. It may be referred to as HV in its monomer unit form. PHV is often also used as a copoly-mer with PHB. Although PHV contains just one additional carbon in the side chain compared to PHB, PHV has a lower melting and glass transition temperature and is far more elastic, in addition to varying the molecular weight of the copolymer versus the homopolymer.67 For instance, it has been shown that in general, a greater number of carbons in the side chain of the PHA leads to: a decrease in melting and glass transition temperatures, a decrease in elastic modulus, and an increase in yield at elongation, as well as potentially lower molecular weight depending on the method of synthesis, crys-tallinity, and polymer type.68–70', 'A greater number of carbons in the PHA backbone and side chain have been particularly associated with an increase in the overall degradation rate.71 This has largely been attributed to the increased number of carbons creating additional steric', 'Fig. 2An overview of the chemistry of PHAs and a simplified breakdown of how these factors affect the structure by level of the material.

Under normal conditions and a non-stressful environment, many PHA-producing micro-organisms will utilize nutrients such as nitrogen, phospho-rous, oxygen and carbon-rich organic matter in the tricar-boxylic acid (TCA) or citric acid cycle to consume energy.57,91', 'The TCA cycle is a well-studied series of chemical reactions that occur within cellular organisms to release stored energy by oxidation of acetyl-CoA derived from energy sources such as fats and carbohydrates.92 Recently, extensive studies have been conducted specifically on the metabolic pathways for the bio-synthesis of various natural and non-natural PHAs that explore these relationships from a mechanistic perspective.28,57,61', 'These reviews provide explicit detail on how PHA biosynthesis is conducted from the metabolism from the carbon source to the polymerization of monomeric components into specific PHAs and should be consulted for specific metabolic pathway and synthesis enzyme details.28,57', 'Both the available biochemical pathways and diversity of PHA-producing organisms have been well-documented in the literature.93–97 Under stressful conditions, such as excess carbon, or limited oxygen or nutrients, microorganisms and bacteria will metabolize the excess organic matter and use the acetyl-CoA normally used in the TCA cycle to instead syn-thesize PHA polymers as energy reserves using either existing orgenetically-encodedbiochemicalpathways.86,91,92Some examples of these biochemical reactions include hydrolysis, transesterification, and glycolysis, which are each also used to convert PHA precursors such as fatty acids, sugars, and amino acids into PHA monomers. These monomers are subsequently converted to intracellular granules of PHA polymers, which are stored in the microorganism.98,99 Depending on the available biochemical pathways and the substrate, both wild-type and genetically modified microorganisms have been shown to be able to synthesize a variety of PHAs.45,97', 'In general, PHA commercial production involves the culture of microorganisms for replication, followed by mixing in a cul-tivation tank or bioreactor with a substrate such as glycerol, starch, or other carbon sources using products such as carbon dioxide gas, food waste, dairy processing waste, and used cooking oil.86,90,100Under specific, nutrient-limiting con-ditions, the microorganisms will then produce PHA polymers internally, consuming the substrate to varying degrees of gene-ration of polymer mass.80 For instance, wild-type C. necator has been observed to generate up to 80% of its original dry weight in PHA polymer.57,89', 'The raw PHA polymer is released from the biomass via cell lysis following completion of biosynthesis, followed by solvent extraction.101,102 Lysis is often performed to break open the organism and perform the extraction using a centrifuge and a series of filtration steps. The PHA can then be purified and dried into a useable form, such as a powder or granule form for additional processing. These methods have been well-docu-mentedbyavarietyofbothhistoricalandcurrent studies.101,103 The leftover residual non-PHA biomass can also potentially be used for other uses such as fertilizer.89 The extent to which commercial production methods of PHAs themselves directly and indirectly affect the resulting chemical structure is still an open area of research.57,97 Prior investi-gation has revealed that many possible PHA homopolymer and copolymer structures can be obtained by utilizing variations in the microorganisms themselves, indicating that one of the main contributing factors to producing different types of PHAs are the available metabolic pathways that are present within each unique organism.104–108', 'Recently, an extensive review was assembled on the diversity of microbial production of bio-derived monomers and the environmental circularity in their production, including indi-vidual strain, carbon sources, and yield.

For instance, one ‘chemical’ or semi-artificial means of PHA production involves the recycling of fossil fuel-based feed-stock or other chemical waste products to provide the energy resources for bacterial to generate the PHB. In this way, these approaches are not necessarily ‘chemical’ in nature as they still involve the biological synthesis of PHAs, but they incorporate chemical feedstocks into the biological means of developing the polymer. This process of ‘up-cycling’ waste feedstocks has been well-explored.86,97,128,129 One approach by Parodi and colleagues has also incorporated waste PHB itself directly into the feedstock cycle to synthesis ‘new’ PHB material, working to complete the circular waste-to-use lifecycle using an Oxa-Michael reaction to generate PHB monomers.130 A recent study by Zhang and col-leagues has exemplified this ‘hybrid’ synthesis approach to combine both chemical and biological processes to produce PHAs.131 These approaches are typically less-utilized than conven-tional biological fermentation processes.27,58', 'Other approaches to developing PHAs by chemical means have explored alternate routes to modifying, by blending or grafting for instance, or chemically synthesizing the polymer. For instance, Olivera and colleagues have reported chemical modification of PHAs via halogenation, epoxidation, hydroxy-lation, carboxylation, chemical cross linking via sulphur vulca-nization, peroxidation, or radiation-induction, resulting in altered properties of the source biological material.132 In con-trast, chemical synthesis of aromatic PHAs and aromatic-ali-phatic PHAs has been achieved by Westlie and Chen via stereo-selectivering-openingpolymerizationofeight-membered cyclic diolides.133 This approach resulted in high molecular weight copolymerized PHAs, over 200 kg mol−1, which are mechanically resilient, hard, but ductile, up to 191% elonga-tion at break. In addition, these copolymers of PHB also achieved a thermal decomposition temperature of 281 °C, which is much higher than typically biologically produced PHAs.133', 'Another commonly-studied starting pathway for developing synthetic PHB by chemical means features alternating propy-lene oxide and carbon monoxide. This is typically a challen-ging retrosynthesis and copolymerization process. In addition, ring-opening polymerization of β-lactones is also used. Both of these processes require additional development for full indus-trial scaling.27 It is well-established that the conversion of different substances to PHA polymers by both small-batch and industrial biological means is a result of selectivity, genetic pathways, nutrient limitation, carbon sources, and biocatalysts and enzyme availability, all of which can lead to high disper-sity indices and high degrees of variation in the polymer mole-cular weight as well as batch to batch differences in the length of the polymer chains.27,58 These reports indicate chemical modification or production of PHAs can lead to customizable property value ranges and yield exciting new opportunities for further study.

The study also reported valuable information regarding the relationship between crys-tallization time, crystallization temperature, and molecular weight for synthesized PHB. High molecular weight PHB requires more time to crystallize during cooling, resulting in low values of crystallization temperature and the lowest degrees of crystallinity among the tested samples.134', 'These examples demonstrate how a change in structure can affect other PSPP relationships, such as the properties of PHAs, which are described in the following section.

The crystalliza-tion temperature was also shown to decrease by up to 40 °C above the starting PHB, along with a decreased degradation rate.232 In other solvent casting studies, drying in an atmo-sphere saturated with the solvent was used to achieve uniform mechanical properties and avoid internal stress formations.144', 'Building on the solvent casting technique, Kang and col-leagues investigated oxygen plasma glow discharge after casting PHB films and the subsequent interaction with human fibroblasts.233 This process can be used to graft polyethylene oxide onto the film to introduce grafted acrylic acid groups and immobilize insulin for an attachment and proliferation study with human fibroblast cells for tissue culture.

The overall melting temperature of the PHBV copolymer is lower than PHB monomer, and various copolymer ratios of HB and HV experiencing other pro-cessing histories including extrusion and compression (hot press) molding have been previously explored.141,145 In an example, Larsson and colleagues used a twin screw extrusion device to vary the melt temperature, rotation speed, and copo-lymer (PHB-co-P4HB) ratios and examined changes in blend morphology, thermal and glass transition temperatures, and viscoelastic properties.141 All samples experienced a decrease in the glass transition and melting temperatures, a decrease in the crystallinity, and an increase in the dynamic shear modulus (indicating a more elastic material) compared to the', 'starting control material.141 A summary of the property changes that result from blends of PHB with other PHA mono-mers, other biomacromolecules, and various conventional polymers are provided in Table 2.

This process ultimately dictates applications in which the material can be used.151,235 PHAs compatible with existing polymer processing equipment that can be used for other polymers as well are also less expensive. For example, monomeric or overly high ratios of hydroxyvalerate (HV) co-monomer (over about 40%) make the polymer overly soft, sticky, and unsuitable for processes such as injection-molding.56,244,245 Therefore, the copolymer ratio, both with other PHAs and with other materials, is typi-cally seen as one of the most important processing factors for PHAs.75,235', 'In addition to PHA homopolymers and PHA–PHA organized block or random copolymers, there have been previous PHA processing studies that have altered the structure of existing PHAbio-basedpolymerswithothertypesofbiological materials.76,177 Some examples of such blended materials include PLA, starch, lignin, and cellulose as blends with com-mercial or lab-produced PHB to produce new, combined structures.75,83 Lugoloobi and colleagues utilized a blend of lignin and PHB developed using Pickering emulsion and formed films via thermal compression.178 The overall crystalli-nity of the film was increased as well as the elastic modulus and tensile strength while retaining a similar degradation rate to the base polymers, but making it more brittle than either in the process.178', 'Valentini and colleagues have explored the influence of blending with fibrillated nanocellulose on the degradation rate and thermal properties of PHBHHx.79 The authors produced the PHBHHx blend via ultrasonication and solution mixing with an increasing cellulose concentration ranging from 0.5 wt% to 3 wt%.79 Elastic modulus and tensile strength reached a maximum increase at the 0.5 wt% concentration,', 'Table 2A summary of PHB blend schema with other two other PHA monomers, several biopolymer materials, and various conventional polymers.

However, there were distinct phase domains of homopolymer PHB visible in a continuous PBAT matrix. This result indicated immiscibility. Dicumyl per-oxide, a compatibilizer, was added in situ during extrusion. The overall miscibility and blend properties of the polymer were improved by this addition.141', 'In another study, Tamiya and colleagues examined a blend of PHBHHx with PS that were grafted together to make a film that was shown to be heterogeneous, opaque, and brittle, showing similar immiscibility between PHAs and synthetic polymers.236 However, when modified using propargyl-termi-nated PHBHHx and azide-modified PS, the films exhibited improved homogeneity, transparency, and improved elastic modulus and tensile strength compared to the previous grafted blend or the PHBHHx alone.236 These processing studies indicate the need for an additional compatibilizer or Cu-catalyzed azide–alkyne cyclo-addition reactions. Both of these methods are very well understood processes, but these techniques may not always be environmentally sustainable or economical for scaling up the process in industrial and com-mercial settings.180', 'Single-layered PHB monomeric films have often been shown to be too brittle for mechanical analyses.240 To create a single-layered homopolymer film, PHB granules were blended with PCL by solvent casting.

Comparing untreated controls with the single-layered PCL film and heat treated multi-layered PHB-co-PCL polymers, the tensile strength and elastic modulus of the single layer PCL film was slightly higher, but the multi-layered copolymer film was shown to be more elastic with a higher yield at break, indicating shifts in the properties for PHA copo-lymer films depending on processing history.240 PHAs in general, and particularly homopolymeric PHB, are often blended with PCL or other materials in various forms to custo-mize the thermal processing range, degradation rate, and mechanical strength of the blend by taking advantage of the different properties between the materials.86', 'Investigating potential processing techniques and optional blending strategies to achieve desired property ranges will be helpful for future work.

These methods provide an approach to overcoming property limitation chal-lenges in porous scaffolds for hard tissue engineering.267 The ability to tailor the geometry of the final products, tune the mechanical properties, and improve hydrophilicity for cell compatibility have all been reported as advantages of additive manufacturing for PHA biopolymers and blends.82 Several cases of these blends, such as with alginate, lignin, beeswax, cellulose, and poly(urethane acrylate), have demonstrated improvedperformanceinspecificbiomedical applications.82,269', 'In addition to blends, composites of PHA materials with other materials have demonstrated potential in additive manu-facturing.NovelPHBHHx-fibrillatednanocellulosebio-degradable composites for additive manufacturing have been produced and characterized by Valentini and colleagues.79', 'Composite filaments having a nanofiller concentration of 0.5 wt%, 1 wt% and 3 wt% were then extruded, characterized and used in fused deposition modeling.79 The presence of fibrillated nanocellulose did not affect the thermal degra-dation behavior of the materials, nor were the glass transition and the melting temperatures influenced.79 This study marked a promising approach to overcoming the current limitations of PHA processing by utilizing new polymerization techniques in combination with other biopolymers (such as nanocellulose used here).79', 'Additive manufacturing of PHAs is an emerging field of study that is rapidly expanding. Within the past five years, many studies have established specific methods such as fused deposition modeling to assist in tailoring PHAs and PHAs blended with other materials to achieve specific mechanical properties and improve their overall performance, particularly in biomedical applications. However, these studies have also highlighted the need for continued investigation to further connecting the PSPP relationships and expand the field by continuing to relate the structure of blended PHAs to their pro-perties with these novel processing techniques.', '5.4Other applications of PHAs', 'The scope of PHAs for consumer applications is not limited to the areas of food packaging, biomedical applications, or addi-tive manufacturing alone. In fact, the use of PHAs continues to expand into a wide variety of commercial sectors. PHAs have been studied and utilized in various industrial applications such as textiles, agricultural products (e.g., livestock feeds and', 'mulch bags for crop production), automotive lubricants, bio-fuels for aerospace, cosmetic additives, electronics com-ponents, paint additives, biodegradable ink for printing dispo-sable packaging, and adhesives.28,272,273 Studies have also uti-lized the anti-adhesion and anti-fouling nature of hydrophilic PHBs to: (1) suppress biofilm development in aquaculture facilities to decrease bacterial contamination, (2) improve the sweat-wicking, texture, and degradability of certain textiles and clothing products, and (3) develop wearable biomolecule sensors by modifying the functional groups of the PHA side chain.28,239,263 PHAs with a low viscosity have been used for injection molding to produce biodegradable diapers and other disposable hygienic products.28', 'PHAs are a unique biopolymer material in that they exhibit a piezoelectric effect not often reported in other polymers such as PLA or PCL.255,276–278 The piezoelectric effect in PHB has been well-documented for nearly four decades.279 PHAs have been investigated for use in components of electronic devicessuchasheadphones,microphones,and atomizers.28,48,264 Due to their biocompatibility, PHAs have also been investigated for potential applications in flexible or wearable electronics,255,277,278,280 recently for their potential for nerve tissue regeneration and nervous tissue engineering as a piezoelectric soft material,254,255,276 and for their bacterio-static effects.281 These studies build the foundation of this unique effect in PHAs which may further lead to other interest-ing applications such as soft piezoelectric devices in measure-ment tools or characterization equipment with future study. ', 'Recent work has also investigated PHAs as a potential fire retardant by aiming to improve the thermal properties of PHBVcopolymerizedwithpoly(butyleneadipate-co-tere-phthalate). Combined with metal oxide nanofillers as a stabil-izer, these copolymers have been shown to display both good flame retardancy and mechanical properties.28 This is another exciting and unique feature that distinguishes PHAs from other types of commercial biopolymers. Finally, other recent studies have included exploring PHAs for use in biocomposites and as nanocomposites or nanoparticles with other inorganic and organic materials with the goal of improving the overall degradation and biocompatibility of the desired applications.28', 'There is much potential for future expansion into other appli-cations not listed here. Future work will certainly utilize the relationships between the structure, properties, processing, and performance of PHAs for a more comprehensive under-standing of biopolymer design and to explore these yet undis-covered applications.', '6Discussion and future outlook', 'In traditional implementations of the materials science tetra-hedron, the PSPP relationships have been essential for not only providing a framework for an improved understanding of the fundamental concepts, but also for establishing best prac-tices towards the rational design and optimization of novel and existing materials.51,52 In this review, we have leveraged', 'Polymer ChemistryReview', 'This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2025Polym.

We have started the discussion of bringing together cutting-edge data science techniques with previous decades’ worth of thorough PHA research in an inter-connected and coherent way as previous studies have done with the digital version of the PSPP tetrahedron.51', 'PHAs present an excellent opportunity for future sustain-able materials design and exhibit diverse chemistries with tunable properties that are of interest in a broad range of potential applications. It is imperative that the community continues to investigate the entire holistic co-design challenge in order to address the current issues pertaining to economic viabilityandpropertytrade-offs/limitationswithfuture research.238 The COVID-19 worldwide crisis has also high-lightedinrecentyearstheneedformoresystematic approaches and collaboration from industry, governments, and consumers to address the issue of plastic production, recovery, and degradation.7', 'However, the use of sustainable raw material and resources alone does not make a material sustainable. Holistic bio-derived polymer sustainability involves a variety of factors including economic feasibility, scalability with existing or new equipment for synthesis and processing, technical feasibility, and overcoming biological limitations. The economic demand and costs of each of these challenges must also be addressed. ', 'Therefore, future research will also need to incorporate an analysis of these challenges and address current bottlenecks to identify innovative solutions to these problems throughout the entire life cycle of the material, not just for PHAs, but for other classes of future bio-derived materials as well. PHAs are still currently too expensive to be economically sustainable for widespread use in multiple applications. We suggest that the next steps for PHA materials development must incorporate a holistic approach to design by taking into consideration the PSPP relationships outlined in this review in order to reduce these costs. ', 'The concept of “co-design” principles must be paramount going forward. For example, future work investigating the cost-effectiveness of the PHA production process must take into account the genetic and biological compatibility of the PHA producing organism strains, carbon sources, and the fermen-tation and bioreactor processes. These future studies should also take into account the utilization of waste feedstock, raw material processing, and resource recovery features all within the same experimental (or data-enabled) framework to design PHAs that possess the desired property portfolio for a target application.28', 'For instance, previously examined biosynthesis factors and production potential of PHAs using different carbon sources, microorganisms, and nutrient limitations as experimental factors have been well-documented on their own individually andinrelationtoeachotherfromabiosynthetic standpoint.20,86,100,125 However, as with the structural and morphological aspects of PHAs and their relationship to PHA properties, a quantifiable, comprehensive relationship that considers each of the three major PHA-structure biosynthesis', 'factors (microbe type, carbon source, and nutrient limitations) and the resulting PHAs that each combination produces has not yet been fully established. ', 'Clarifying these biosynthesis factors which affect the struc-ture of PHAs has the potential to enhance the overall design process of PHAs by establishing a PSPP relationship between how the material is biologically or synthetically prepared, its resulting structure, and the subsequent properties. Future studies would benefit from establishing such a relationship. Continued exploration will ideally also consider cost-effective biosynthesis techniques to access and control these specific structures. ', 'With regard to the use of data-enabled design and ML, this is one area that we place an emphasis on understanding the experimental implications and physical meaning of results. Ideally, ML may be implemented in future work to streamline and optimize laboratory processes and synthesis schemes. We recommend a goal of tailoring the desired properties of PHAs specifically to meet desired property ranges for optimized per-formance in desired applications using these existing design strategies in polymer informatics with an awareness of PSPP relationships.189', 'Future research may also seek to break down the PSPP co-design principle into even smaller pieces, to still examine ways to expedite PHA research and development in more simple ML models. Such future explorations may include: (1) a surrogate model-based prediction using ML, and generated by polymer-and bio-informatics models, to develop a predictive and quan-titative understanding of the PSPP relationships, (2) an experi-mental design approach that leverages active learning and informatics-based approaches to more effi', 'ciently investigate and validate theoretical predictions of the thermal, mechanical and other relevant properties, (3) the design of possible models and predictive analysis of optimized processing con-ditions for PHAs and other biopolymers to ensure their com-patibility with existing industrial polymer processing equip-ment, and (4) further experimentation and ML model combi-nationsincorporatingnovelorenhancedmicroorganism strains to improve the PHA productivity and yield via genetic engineering.28,239', 'Increased focus on environmentally-friendly production and processing processes, from synthesis and fermentation to more effi', 'cient and reliable downstream recovery strategies are still needed, and are currently open areas for future study and exploration.273 The thermal properties, mechanical durability, and barrier properties of PHAs must be investigated in tandem, rather than in isolation, as per the co-design prin-ciples of the materials tetrahedron to develop a more quanti-tative understanding of PSPP mappings. In this way, research-ers may be able to address that processing conditions are ulti-mately suitable to achieve the target performance.
