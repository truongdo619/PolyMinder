Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25�C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 �C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 �10�4 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 �0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 �C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 �C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by significant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of �4 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers. �2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through proton', 'exchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Nafion�as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18]. Transport properties and nanostructure of sulfonated polyimide (SPI) membranes have been studied using pulsed field gradient NMR and NMR quadrupolar relaxation rates determinations [19,20], and small angle scattering methods (SAXS and SANS), respectively [21,22].', '* Corresponding author.

We recently reported a class of ionomers based on aromatic hydrocarbon copolymers with high proton conductivity and excellent thermal mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states [22e29]. Sulfonated poly-arylenethioethersulfone(SPTES)copolymershavefollowing chemical structures (Fig. 1). SPTES copolymers including SPTES-50, SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80, have equivalent weight (EW) and IEC (mequiv./g) values of 610, 515, 459, 417, and 1.64, 1.94, 2.18, and 2.4, respectively [22]. They exhibited proton conductivity of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm respectively, at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity [22]. Their excellent proton conductivity at high temperatures combined with their high glass transition temperature (w200 �C) and mechanical stability (both in the dry and hydrated states) make them excellent potentials as high temperature PEM materials for fuel cells. SPTES-50 copolymer membrane has successfully been fabricated to membrane electrode assemblies and exhibited polarization curves and durability up to 400 h [29]. Their successful operations at 90e100 �C were limited by boiling point of water (100 �C at 1 atm). Replacing water molecules with heterocycles such as imidazolium where the charge carrier has a very low vapor pressure can result in proton conductivity at higher temperatures. Despite excellent electrochemical properties, excessive water uptake of SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes provide difficulties to be made as membrane electrode assembly [22,27] The proton transport and performance of SPTES copolymers highly depend on the presence of water molecules. In addition to the number of sulfonic groups, their acidity (pKa) ability to dissociate water molecules to proton, water activity coefficient, and number of water molecules associated with each sulfonic group, the supermolecular structure of the hydro-phobic and hydrophilic phases is also defined by polymer chain characteristics such as chain persistent length, and presence of sulfonic group on the backbone or in the side chains. We reported the presence of ionic nanodomains containing water molecules in the SPTES-70 using in-situ x-ray scattering [27]. The morphology and the nanostructure of SPTES-50 were approximated by corre-lated polydisperse spherical aggregates and a larger scale water domain network and were quantified by modeling of the SANS spectra with polydisperse hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [29]. This study reports the nanostructure and morphology of sulfonated polyarylenethioethersulfone (SPTES) copolymer membranes which is directly related to the proton transport through the membrane in terms of their degree of sulfonation and temperature dependency.', '2. Materials and methods', '2.1. Materials', 'Visually observed defect free films of SPTES copolymers were prepared by dissolving the purified copolymer in dimethyl acet-amide (DMAc, Sigma Aldrich) (5e10 wt%) filtering, placing in a flat dish in a vacuum oven with a gradual temperature rise to 100 �C for 24 h and 120 �C for 2 h. The resulting uniform flat films were immersed for 2 h in deionized water and dried under vacuum (24 h, 80 �C) after they were acidified in sulfuric acid (4 M, 24 h) to ensure complete conversion of sulfonic groups to their protonated forms.', '2.2. Characterization', 'SANS experiments were performed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Neutron Center for Research using 30 m NG-7 SANS instrument with a neutron wavelength, l, of 6 Å (Dl/l ¼ 10%) and three sample-to-detector distance of 1.5 m, 10 m (l ¼ 6 Å), and 15 m (l ¼ 8 Å), 0.001 < q < 0.3168 Å�1 at 25, and 55 �C (accuracy of 0.5 �C). Hydrated membranes were placed in demountable 1 mm thick titanium liquid cells filled with D2O after equilibrium in D2O (24 h). Scattered intensities were reduced, corrected for the transmission and background and placed on absolute scale. Then, circularly averaged to produce absolute scale scattering intensity, I(q), as a function of the wave vector, q, where q ¼ (4p/l)sin(q/2) and q is the scattering angle. Calculations were performed using Igor Pro�software [30,31]. USANS experiments covered a q-range of 0.00005 < q (Å�1) < 0.01, corresponding to a real-space length scale of 0.1 microne10 micron.', '3. Results and discussions', '3.1. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 25 �C', 'SPTES copolymers have high proton conductivity at high relative humidities and elevated temperatures; e.g. 65 �C and 85% RH of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers, respectively [27]. The degree of sulfonation increases for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6%, respectively. SPTES-50 copolymer has the lowest the degree of sulfonation and SPTES-80 copolymer has the highest degree of sulfonation in this class of copolymers [22,27]. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers at 25 �C show a scattering behavior of a two phase structure (Fig. 2a). The contribution of sulfonic groups to the scattering is considered to be negligible due to their small volume compared to the polymer and the water phase volume. It was visually observed that membranes do not dissociate when fully hydrated in the examined temperature. It was also determined by weight measurement that the membranes maintain the weight after deswelling. Therefore, the hydrophobic polymeric structure is the supporting network even at high water content and increased temperatures. Fig. 2a presents enhanced scattering intensity data (vertically shifted) for the hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copol-ymer membranes in the order of 20X, 1000X, and 2 �105X for the clarity of data presentation. The absolute scale scattering intensities in the medium q range of 0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1 are almost in the same intensity range for all SPTES copolymers. The high q scattering spectra for all copolymers exhibit a feature which is attributed to the presence of ionic domains containing water molecules. According to the scattering results, the morphology of all hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C can be approximated as correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates with liquid-like ordering (P.Y. ordering) and a power law decay [29]. The scattering data for the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C were compared and quantified using polydisperse (Schulz polydispersity) hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [32e34] and a low q power law decay [29]. The modeling of the SPETS 50 nanostructure and its properties have been reported elsewhere but presented here for', 'Fig. 1.

Yoonessi et al. / Polymer 52 (2011) 5615e56215616', 'clarity and completeness of the SPTES series analysis [29]. Fig. 2b shows the experimental scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 25 �C compared with the theoretical calculations of the model (solid line). The results of the comparison of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes scattering data with the model are summarized in Table 1. According to this modeling the domain radius increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 13.45,14.9,15.4, and 16.9 Å for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes. The hard sphere packing density increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 19.8%, 23%, 25%, 29% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. This could indicate that ionic domains are capable of holding more water molecules with the presence of more sulfonic groups on the polymer backbone (increasing the degree of sulfonation). The high-q scattering spectra exhibits onset of a peak formation when the degree of sulfonation was increased to 71.6% for SPTES-80 copolymer. Pres-ence of scattering maxima can be due to the scattering from an ordered structure (periodicity) or the oscillations resulted from the structural factor effects or the excluded volume effect arising from short range liquid-like ordering. The onset of peak formation is attributed to the excluded volume effects related to the liquid-like ordering [33e35]. The low-q power law decay of nearly �3 was observed for all SPTES copolymers in the range of 1 �10�4 < q (1/ Å) < 3 �10�3. The power law decay of �3 is attributed to the presence of interacting three-dimensional fractal morphology. In addition, a Guinier plateau [35] was present for the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer at the very low q (q (1/Å) < 9 �10�5). This is in addition to the nearly identical scattering intensity in the inter-mediate q-range (0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1). It can be concluded that the change in the degree of sulfonation had little or no effect on the intermediate and low angle scattering wave vector. The low-q power law decay was nearly �3 �0.1 for all SPTES copolymers. The presence of sharp interface between hydrophobic and hydro-philic domains was deduced from the power law decay of �4 at large angle wave vectors for all hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes. All scattering data presented in Fig. 2a shows a power slope of �3.85 to �4.15 which is approximated as w �4. The presence of Porod behavior (decay of �4) has been attributed to the two immiscible phase with a sharp boundary [35e37]. This shows that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are separated with a distinct interface containing sulfonic groups. Presence of a plateau in the scattering spectra is characteristics of isolated scatterers [35]. The radius of gyration (Rg) of the isolated scatterers can be approximated by IðqÞ ¼ I0expðð�q2R2gÞ=3Þ, where I0 is the extrapolated zero scattering intensity (Guinier approxi-mation) [35]. Presence of the Guinier plateau in the q range of 4.3 �10�5 < q (1/Å) < 8.2 �10�5 for SPTES-80 copolymer suggests segregation of the isolated large scale hydrophilic water pockets when the degree of sulfonation increased to 71.6%.

Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 55 �C', 'Based on the physical observations, water saturated membranes at 55 �C were swollen films without visual dissociation. Fig. 3 exhibits the scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. The inter-mediate scattering intensity decreased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes start to form scattering maxima at high q range when the degree of sulfonation increased. This indicated the increase in the excluded volume due to the increase in the volume of the scatterers at higher degree of sulfonation and increased temperature (55 �C). The presence of scattering maxima is more significant for SPTES-70 copolymer and SPTES-80 copolymer with 63.3 and 71.6% degree of sulfonation. The large angle scattering feature shows scattering maxima at qmax of 0.103 and 0.1108 1/Å for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers which correspond to spatial characteristics lengths (l ¼ 2p/qmax) of 60.97 and 56.7 Å due to concentration fluctuations of hydrated domains (hard spheres). The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes changed significantlywith increasing degree of sulfonation. This indicates a substantial change in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology with increasing degree of sulfonation at 55 �C which is more pronounced for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers (degree of sulfonation 63.3 and 71.6%, respectively). Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are segregated distinctly by the sulfonic groups at the interface which is repre-sented by the Porod behavior, asymptotic behavior of w �4 for all SPTES copolymers [35e37]. The morphology of these membranes is complex and controlled by interfacial phenomena. The number of sulfonic groups per repeat unit volume and their acidity com-plemented with the chain persistent length and chain mobility are governing factors in the formed morphology. This study approxi-mates the morphology of the fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55 �C are approximated as spherical nanodomains containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering similar to their morphology at 25 �C. It is also proposed that this morphology changedtofractalmorphologywithincreasing temperature (increasing the intermediate scattering decay). The domain radius and the sphere packing density were increased from 26.4 Å and 28% for SPTES-50 copolymer to 32 Å and 33% for SPTES-60copolymerwhiletheintermediatescatteringintensity decreased. The domain radius and packing density of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane increased from 13.45 Å and 19.8% to 26.4 Å and 28% when the temperature increased from 25 �C to 55 �C with this approximation. The same increasing trend of 14.9 Åe32 Å for the average domain radius and 23%e33% of the sphere packing density was observed. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane compared to the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane is attributed to the disruption of the large scale morphology. The low q power law decay of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane was close to the decay of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane. The increase in the degree of sulfonation of SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymers from 54.9, to 63.3 and 71.6% resulted in a shift in the position of the high q scattering maxima of the hydrated membranes toward the large angle scattering regime. This peak formation is more prominent for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copoly-mers with higher sulfonation degree. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering intensity in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70 and', '-80 copolymers is attributed to the loss of the large scale water network, intermediate fractal morphology within the polymer and onset of a morphology change to a two large scale phase morphology. The closed domain morphology of polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with fractal network were present for fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55�C (Figs. 3 and 4a). However, substantialchangesinthemorphologyoffullyhydrated membranes occurred when the degree of sulfonation is increased to 63.3 and 71.6% for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers at higher temperature of 55 �C. Combination of high temperature, high density of sulfonic groups, and significant amount of water mole-cules within the polymer backbone could have resulted in the coalescence of the small spherical ionic domains and fractal water network into a larger scale bicontinuous network of intermeshed hydrophobic and hydrophilic morphology for fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane at 55 �C. The bicontinuous model origi-nally proposed for micro-emulsion of two immiscible phases of water and oil with comparable amount based on Landau theory [38,39]. This model describes two irregular shapes with distinct boundary and has been used for intermesh of hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure when the particle shape is not well-defined [40,41]. This model proposes I(q) ¼ (a2þc1q þ c2q2)�1 for a2 > 0, c1 < 0, and c2 > 0, a single broad scattering maxima, and power law decay of �4 at large scattering angles. Two characteristics lengths of d and x are deduced from this analysis having a2, c1, and c2[39,40], d is the domain periodicity or interdomain distance and x is the correlation length which has been attributed to the dispersion of d. According to this theory, c1 is negative due to the surfactant. The absolute values of c1 and the ratio of x/d should increase with increasing surfactant. The specific internal surface area can be derived from the ratio of S/V ¼ 44(1�4)/x [38,39]. The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane has a low-q upturn, a lower intermediate scattering intensity compared to the hydrated SPTES-60 and SPTES-50 copolymers, and a large angle maxima followed by a power law decay of �4. This indicates the onset of the coalescence of the ionic aggregates, disruption of the fractal water network, and the formation of the two irregular large scale bicontinuous phase morphology. The high q range (q > 0.037 1/Å) of the scattering', 'Fig. 3. Scattering spectra of fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES copolymers at 55 �C. The high q scattering exhibit a power law decay of �4. High q range maxima position of hydrated SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 shifts toward higher q with increasing degree of sulfonation.', 'M. Yoonessi et al. / Polymer 52 (2011) 5615e56215618', 'spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 55 �C was compared with the T.S. bicontinuous model (Fig. 4b). This simulation resulted in a periodicity, d, of 59.9 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima position, 60.97 Å. According to this simulation, the correlation length (x) is 31.14 Å. The medium-q range scattering still exhibits the larger scale morphology which is not completely converted to the bi-continuous phase morphology. However, they are partially collapsed characterized by a lower scattering intensity in the intermediate q range. The high q maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 is approximated as bicontinuous morphology. The low and medium q (q < 0.037 1/Å) scattering spectra of the SPTES 70 is due to the presence of fractal network of waters which have not coalesce yet. The scattering spectra of the SPTES-80 copolymer are consistent with a bicontinuous two phase structure of irregular shapes with sulfonic groups as interfacial ionic region. The scattering experi-mental data of the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was compared with this model (q > 0.015 1/Å), (Fig. 4c and Table 2). The periodicity of the water domains (or hydrophobic domains), d, predicted by this model is w54 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima (qmax), 56.7 Å. This value is the distance between water domains. The correlation length (x) obtained from this model is 37.86 Å which is a measure of dispersion. The distance between the water phases, periodicity, was decreased from 59.9 Å to 54 Å with increasing degree of sulfona-tion. The correlation length, x, was increased from 31.14 Å to 37.86 Å when the degree of sulfonation increased. Increasing the interfacial area results in an increase in the x/d ratio. The presence of the upturn in the low range of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 at 55 �C (Fig. 4b and c) is attributed to the fractal morphology of the large scale features.', '3.3. Discussions', 'Scattering data of series of SPTES membranes were obtained in the full hydration state with increasing the sulfonation degree in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. Complete study was performed to provide understanding membranes morphology with increasing the temperature of the hydrated membranes from 25 �C to 55 �C. Proposed model assumes spherical nanodomains containing water molecules forming from clustering of the sulfonation groups. This assumption was performed based on previously reported study which showed spherical nanodomains in the dry SPTES 50 membrane under HR-TEM [29]. The scattering spectra of the membranes with high degree of sulfonation (SPTES 70, and 80) changed significantly when the temperature increased to 55 �C.

This study attempted to study a full range of SPTES membrane nanostructure for the first time and provide an understanding of large membrane water uptakes, and their morphology and their relation with high conductivity of the membranes using both liquid like ordering of polydisperse nano-spheres and bi-continuous T.S. model approximation.', '4. Conclusions', 'A series of SPTES copolymers with high proton conductivity of 100e215 mS/cm at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity as potential fuel cells membranes were studied.

This model predicted that the increase in the degree of sulfonation resulted in an increase in the radius of ionic domains and an increase in the volume packing density of water in the aggregates. It was assumed that the same morphology of polydisperse correlated spherical ionic domains were present in the SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymers when the temperature increased to 55 �C. Increase in the degree of sulfonation for fully hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer at 55 �C led to a substantial reorganization of the membrane morphology which was described by a bi-continuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic network.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to thank the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Nano-structured andBiological Materials Branch forfunding this research.

Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang-', '∗Corresponding author.

Sulfonated polysulfone (PSF) [4], polyetheretherketone (PEEK) [5,6] and polybenzimidazoles (PBIs) [7–11] are among poly-mers which can be used as alternatives for Nafion in PEFCs. Amongpolybenzimidazolederivatives,poly[2,2-5,5(m-phenylene)-bibenzimidazole](PBI),whichisalsocalled commercial polybenzimidazole have been used as a mem-brane material in PEMFCs. Having high chemical as well as thermal resistance and proton conductivity, polybenzimidazoles are great options to be used in the fuel cells with function at elevated temperatures above 100 ◦C [12]. PBIs should have enough proton conductivity so that it could be used as proton exchange membranes in the fuel cells. To achieve this purpose, they are usually doped with a sufficient acid like H3PO4 to an appropriate doping level [13]. Nanocomposite membranes are a new group of membranes which contain nanopar-ticles such as SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 and other compounds [14–21]. The introduction of nanoparticles into the membranes results in a considerable improvement in their features like mechani-cal properties, methanol permeability, but in some cases leads to a decrease in proton conductivity [22–24]. In order to over-come this problem, surface functionalized nanoparticles, which means various compounds with polar groups grafted chemically', '0378-7753/$ – see front matter © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

As men-tioned before, the numerous research works were done concerning grafting various compounds on the SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles which used for different purposes. However, in this work, we have used monomer bearing functional groups like imidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene which can improve the properties of pro-ton conductive membranes. These monomers are polymerized on the surface of the nanoparticles and as a consequence, they can more affect the properties of the membranes than while one functional group is grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. In addition, the polymerization of the selected monomers such as vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface of nanoparticle could cause more compatibility between nanopar-ticles and polymer matrix which finally improve the mechanical properties. In this work, nanocomposite membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles and newly synthesized polybenzimidazole was depicted poly[2,2-5,5-(m-pyrazolidene)-bibenzimidazole] (PPBI). Modification of the mentioned nanoparticles was performed by radical polymerization of some vinyl monomers such as sulfonated styrene and vinylim-idazole on the surface of the nanoparticles to which vinylic group was bounded covalently.

The absence of absorbent peak related to amine group proton (N–H) in the area of 4.0–5.0 ppm and an absorbent related to amide group in the area of 10.3–10.6 ppm show the complete closure of imidazole rings during the polycondensation reaction. In FT-IR characteristics of PPBI, the presence of absorbent bands in 800 cm−1 is related to the vibration of C–H bond of imida-zole, a band in about 1300 cm−1 is related to the vibration of C–N', 'Fig. 3.

Furthermore, the absence of the absorbent band related to the carbonyl group in the vicinity of 1760 cm−1 can be confirmed as an evidence of the completion of cyclization reaction. The FT-IR spectra of modified and un-modified SiO2 nanoparti-cles are shown in Fig. 4(a and b, c), respectively. The presence of the absorbent bands in 3050 cm−1 and 3100 cm−1 can be related to aromatic C–H bonds and also the existence of bands in the area of 2950 cm−1 can be attributed to aliphatic C–H bonds. Also the peaks in 1619 and 1419 cm−1 can be due to C C and C N bonds. In', 'Fig. 4(c), the presence of the absorbent band in 1257 cm−1 is cor-responded to S O bond of the sulfonic acid group. These prove the existence of polymeric chains that are grafted onto the nanoparticle surface. FT-IR spectra of the modified nanoparticles have been measured after complete washing and drying. To be sure of the chemical bonding of all chains (not physical) onto the particle surface, some un-modified nanoparticles were mixed with polymeric solutions of PVI and PSV and were stirred for 1 h. After filtration, the washing method used to wash the modified nanoparticles, was applied to the resulting powder as well. The FT-IR spectrum of the obtained powder did not show any absorbent bands related to PVI and PSV chains. The absorbent bands, which existed in the spectrum of mod-ified nanoparticles, were not observed in this spectrum. So, it was indicated that the polymeric chains have been attached to the par-ticles surface via covalent bonds.', '3.2. Thermal analysis', 'Thermogravimetric analysis diagrams of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 5. Weight loss in 85 ◦C can be related to the release of physically absorbed water. In un-modified nanoparticles, the minor weight loss in elevated temperatures can be attributed to the loss of hydroxyl groups of the particle surface attached by covalent bonds. Weight loss in modified nanoparticles could be a result of thermal degradation of the polymeric chains grafted to the surface of the nanoparti-cles. Also, the weight loss in 230–300 ◦C was due to the thermal decomposition of the sulfonate groups in the grafted PSV chains [30]. Thermograms of PVI modified nanocomposite with 5, 10 and 15% of TiO2 are shown in Fig. 6.

The remaining weight percentage in 850 ◦C is related to the modified TiO2 that is less than the added amount of PVI-modified TiO2 nanoparticles when the membrane was prepared. This decrease in weight in comparison with the theoretical amount could be related due to the degradation of the chains grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. Also, in order to obtain the par-ticular weight of the modified nanoparticles, specific amounts of modified and un-modified nanoparticles were weighed after and before complete burning out all the polymers. They were heated to temperatures about 1000 ◦C for 30 min and the obtained nanoparti-cles were weighed immediately. The difference between the weight of un-modified nanoparticles before and after heating shows the amount of lost water which was either physically absorbed or pro-duced from the condensation reaction of the hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticle surface. Also from the difference between the weight of modified nanoparticles before and after heating and consider-', 'Table 1 The percentages values of grafted chains in nanoparticle surface.', 'SamplesTheoretical values (%)Experimental values (%)', 'SiO2-PVI3828 SiO2-PSV3624 TiO2-PVI2520 TiO2-PSV2518', 'ing the weight of lost water, the percentage of the grafted polymer onto the nanoparticle surface was obtained. The obtained results and theoretical amounts are shown in Table 1. The amounts of the obtained results in all cases are more than theoretical values. This could be related to the presence of free water molecules and hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticles surface in which their values are not subtracted from theoretical values. The diagrams of thermogravimetric analysis of both PPBI and nanocomposites prepared from the modified nanoparticles (10% w/w) are shown in Fig. 7. The weight loss observed in the tempera-ture range of 50–140 ◦C is a result of the release of water adsorbed into the membranes which is less significant in nanocomposites in comparison to pure membrane. The second loss in weight, observed at the temperature range of 500–530 ◦C, is also attributed to the thermal degradation of poly-meric backbone of the nanocomposite membranes which is almost identical to the degradation temperature of pure PPBI. As a result, the addition of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles do not have any noticeable effect on thermal stability of the prepared nanocomposites. As it is observed in Fig. 7, the degradation of PVI-modified nanoparticles occurs at 185 ◦C which is lower than the related tem-perature of PSV-modified ones. Therefore, the former one can be used in fuel cells with performance under 150 ◦C, but PSV-modified membrane is more suitable in high temperature fuel cells.', 'Fig. 7.

Water uptake and doping level', 'Water uptake amount of nanocomposite membranes contain-ing 5, 10 and 15% of modified nanoparticles at 25 ◦C are shown in Fig. 8. Addition of silica nanoparticles to PPBI membranes increased their water uptakes due to the hygroscopic nature of SiO2 and TiO2nanoparticles. The sulfonic and imidazole groups in the nanopar-ticles increased the water uptake to a greater extent. The amount of water uptake for PPBI/TiO2-PSV, PPBI/SiO2-PSV, PPBI/TiO2-PVI and PPBI/SiO2-PVI are 21.6, 22.7, 20.4 and 21.9%, respectively. The effect of sulfonic acid groups of PSV chains grafted onto the nanoparticle surface on the water uptake is more than imidazole groups in PVI chains due to the higher hygroscopic properties of PSV comparing to PVI chains grafted on to the silica nanopar-ticle surface. The water uptake of PPBI/SiO2-PSV is higher than PPBI/TiO2-PSV which can be due to the further increase of the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles in comparison to TiO2 nanoparticle surface. The PPBI-based membranes were doped with 85% H3PO4 to prepare the acid-doped membranes. Fig. 9 shows the acid-doping levels of the PPBI-based nanocomposite membranes. Acid-doping level (H3PO4 molecules per PPBI repeating unit) of pristine PPBI membrane was 13.5, which decreased to 11.8 for PPBI/SiO2, 12.0 for PPBI/SiO2-PSV, 11.7 for PPBI/TiO2 and 12.2 for PPBI/TiO2-PSV', 'Fig. 9.

Some of the amino groups in PPBI chains were blocked with the sulfonic acid groups of TiO2-PSV and SiO2-PSV, to decrease the binding ability of PPBI chains to H3PO4molecules. Among the prepared nanocomposites, the water uptake in PPBI/SiO2-PSV and acid doping in PPBI/SiO2-PVI were the most one. Even in the comparison of these membranes with the simi-lar ones which prepared from modified TiO2 such as PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, the amount of water uptake and doping level were higher. This shows that using modified SiO2 nanoparticles in fuel cells is more appropriate.', '3.4. Proton conductivity', 'The membrane was sandwiched between two stainless steel electrodes and pressed together by clamp. Then, the MEA (Mem-brane Electrolyte Assembly) was inputted in the steam autoclave equipped with temperature controller. For measurement of pro-ton conductivity, the steam autoclave supplied with steam from a house generator for exposure to saturated steam at desired temperature. As an example, for saturated steam the pressure cor-responding to 120 ◦C is 205 kPa. The time of exposure to saturated steam at 120 ◦C was 30 min that this value for temperature of 140 ◦C was increased to 50 min.', 'Fig. 10 shows the Nyquist plot and equivalent circuit of studied membranes at 25 ◦C and RH 100% for some membranes. After fitting the EIS experimental data on the electrical equiv-alent circuit, the membrane proton conductivity was determined from the intercept of EIS data with real impedance Z′ axis (as the value of Rm element). In equivalent circuit, Rm presents the resis-tance of the polymer film between the two metallic electrodes toward charge carriers (i.e. H+). L1 presents the stray inductance of the setup wires. CPE1 presents the non-ideal double layer capac-itance of the film/metal electrode interface. Rct and W0 show the charge transfer resistance of the (possible) reactions at the film/metal electrode interface and the diffusion processes through the polymers film, respectively. The proton conductivities of the phosphoric acid-doped PPBI based nanocomposite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 11) at 100% relative humidity were presented as a function of temperatures up to 80 ◦C. The pro-ton conductivities of all membranes increased with increasing the operation temperature up to 80 ◦C. Addition of the un-modified nanoparticles showed a negative effect on the proton conductivities of nanocomposite membranes. Similar trends were also reported to', 'H. Namazi, H. Ahmadi / Journal of Power Sources 196 (2011) 2573–25832579', 'Fig. 11. Proton conductivities of PPBI based nanocomposite membranes containing SiO2 (a) and TiO2 (b) nanoparticles at 100% relative humidity up to 80 ◦C.', 'other nanocomposite membranes like Nafion®/silica membranes and PBI/silica membranes [31]. On the other hand, comparing the pristine PPBI and Nafion®', '117 membranes, the relatively high proton conductivities of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles are noteworthy [32]. Li et al. have used sulfonated organosilica to modify Nafion® membranes and they found that the proton con-ductivities of the modified membranes were still lower than that of the neat Nafion® membrane. The reduction in the proton conductivity was attributed to the silica-induced changes in the tortuous paths and in the dis-tribution of hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains. However, in this work an enhancing effect on the proton conductivity was observed with addition of PSV and PVI grafted nanoparticles to PPBI mem-brane. The sulfonic and imidazole groups of modified nanoparticles also contribute in the acid-doping effect to PPBI polymer so as to enhance the proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles. Moreover, the presence of modified nanoparticles induces proton conductive pathways lead-ing to an increase in the proton conductivities of PPBI/modified nanoparticles membranes [24]. The proton conductivities of the acid-doped nanocompos-ite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 12) were further', 'Fig. 12. Proton conductivities of PPBI based nanocomposite membranes containing SiO2 (a) and TiO2 (b) nanoparticles at dry environment up to 145 ◦C.', 'studied at high temperatures under an anhydrous environment. All the PPBI/modified nanoparticle membranes still exhibited higher proton conductivities than the pristine acid-doped PPBI membrane. Generally, two principle mechanisms of vehicle mechanism and Grotthuss mechanism (hopping) describe proton diffusion through the membrane [33]. It is possible that the bounded water par-ticipates by the Grotthuss mechanism, and the free water takes part mostly by vehicle mechanism [34]. Addition of silica-SO3H to the membranes increases the bounded water content in the membranes (Fig. 13). The bounded water facilitates the proton transport ability through the Grotthuss mechanism, originating by generation of a continuous proton conductive pathway. There-fore, the high proton conductivity of PPBI/modified nanoparticles can be attributed to the high bounded water content in the membrane. Since the Grotthuss-type diffusion mechanism without assis-tance of the vehicle mechanism has been proposed for the protonconductionunderanhydrousenvironments[35,36], theprotonconductivityoftheacid-dopedPPBI/modified nanoparticlemembranescouldbesynergisticallyresulted from their modified nanoparticle contents and the acid-doping levels. Consequently, the highest proton conductivity was obtained withtheacid-dopedPPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%membraneathigh humidity and low temperatures and PPBI/SiO2-PVI-15% mem-brane in high temperatures and low humidity, which possesses the moderate modified nanoparticles content and acid-doping level. As it is seen in Fig. 9, either we use PSV-modified or un-modified nanoparticles, the increase in the amount of the nanoparticles leads', '2580H. Namazi, H. Ahmadi / Journal of Power Sources 196 (2011) 2573–2583', 'Fig. 13. Illustration of the state of water in the membranes, the interaction between the functional groups of nanoparticles and of PPBI to restrict the nanoparticles motion, and the proton-transport mechanism in the membranes [24].', 'to a decrease in the acid doping level, but when PVI-modified nanoparticles were used, doping level increased. Also, according to Fig. 8, water uptake of the membrane shows an increase when using higher amounts of modified nanoparticles. This increase in PSV-modified nanocomposite membranesishigherinPVI-modified one. Proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PSV-modified nanoparticles shows significant increase in comparison to PVI-modified ones in low temperature and high rel-ative humidity. But in high temperature and low relative humidity, proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PVI-modified nanoparticles is observed to be more than PSV-modified ones and even at 145 ◦C the proton conductivity of PPBI/SiO2-PVI 15% is more than PPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%. The exis-tence of modified nanoparticles in PPBI nanocomposite membranes results in high proton conductivity in three ways:', '1) With increase in water uptake 2) With increase in the amount of doping level and 3) With increase in the number of proton conductive functional groups such as sulfonic acid group.', 'In PSV-modified nanocomposite membranes, acid doping decreases while the water uptake and the number of sulfonic acid groups shows an increase. Consequently, high proton conductiv-ity can be a result of these changes. It should be mentioned that in temperatures higher than 100 ◦C and in very low relative humidity, water uptake of PSV-modified membranes decreases which leads to low efficiency of the sulfonic groups attached onto the surface of the nanoparticles which in turn results in a decrease in proton conduc-tivity in both membranes, but the increase in proton conductivity resulting from high doping level is significant and also the proton conductivity of PVI-modified nanocomposite membranes increase in high temperatures. It is noteworthy that Nafion® 117 shows relatively low pro-ton conductivities under anhydrous conditions and almost lacks its proton conductivities at high temperatures. Comparing to Nafion®', '117 membranes, the high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicate that this membrane could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', '3.5. Mechanical properties', 'The mechanical properties of the PPBI-based membranes were measured. The stress–strain curves are shown in Fig. 14. Pristine', 'PPBI membrane showed an elongation at break of 38%. Mod-ification of nanocomposites with SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles results in an increase in the tensile strengths and a subse-quent decrease in the elongations at break for the PPBI-based membranes. For PPBI/modified nanoparticles nanocomposites membranes (PPBI/modified nanocomposite consists of the PPBI and surface-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles by PVI and PSV chains and PPBI/unmodified nanocomposite includes PPBI and SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles without any treatment), the presence of ionic linkages between PPBI and silica particles can be assigned to their high Young’s modulus. Introduction of modified and un-modified nanoparticles increases the brittleness of the nanocomposite mem-branes with a decrease in their elongations at break. The effects of modified and unmodified nanoparticles on the elongations at break of the nanocomposite membranes were different. The decrease in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness were widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inorganic reinforcement [37–39]. Moreover, the ionic linkages in nanocomposite membranes prepared from modi-fied nanoparticles are higher than hydrogen bonding in PPBI/SiO2and PPBI/TiO2.', 'Fig. 14. Stress–strain curves of PPBI and nanocomposite membranes containing 10% nanoparticles.', 'H. Namazi, H. Ahmadi / Journal of Power Sources 196 (2011) 2573–25832581', 'Fig. 15.

The brittleness of membranes pre-pared from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI are less than PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV membranes which are perhaps due to more com-patibility of PVI grafted chains onto the nanoparticles surface with PPBI backbone. Comparing the brittleness of the nanocomposite membranes of the PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/SiO2-PVI with PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, respectively indicates that the brittleness of the membranes prepared with modified SiO2 nanoparticles is less than the modified TiO2 ones.', '3.6. Morphological analysis', 'The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photographs of the PPBI/TiO2-PSV nanocomposite membranes surface with various amounts of TiO2-PSV are shown in Fig. 15. A relatively flat surface is observed for thin membranes of pure PPBI (Fig. 15(a)). Fig. 15(b–d) display surface morphological properties of nanocomposite membranes having 5, 10 and 15% of TiO2-PSV, respectively. As seen in Fig. 15, TiO2-PSV nanoparticles are dispersed homo-geneously in PPBI matrixes and are increased with increasing of the percentage of TiO2-PSV nanoparticles. Also the major amounts of nanoparticles size are in the range of nanoscale and the bigger parti-cles as evidence for the formation of aggregations are not observed.', 'The size of the TiO2-PSV particles are about 25–40 nm and the size of particles on the surface of the nanocomposite are determined to be 30–60 nm.', 'Fig. 16(a) shows the SEM micrographs of the modified SiO2nanoparticles. If the interactions between silica nanoparticles are stronger than that of between PPBI molecules and silica nanoparticles, the silica nanoparticles are agglomerated together to form silica domains in micrometer sizes. The compatibility between PPBI and unmodified nanoparticles and the homogene-ity of the PPBI/SiO2 or PPBI/TiO2 membranes are somewhat poor [32]. However, the dispersion homogeneity of silica nanoparticles in PPBI membranes could be significantly improved with using surface modified nanoparticles as the additives. As shown in Fig. 16(b), the dispersion homogeneity of modified nanoparticles is observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2 nanocomposite membrane, which demonstrates high compatibility between PPBI polymer and PSV-SiO2 nanoparticles and the high dispersion abil-ity of PSV-SiO2 in PPBI matrix. Particle agglomeration is still not observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2-10%. The ionic linkages between PPBI and modified nanoparticles are contributed to their higher compatibility [32]. However, in nanocompos-ite membranes prepared from un-modified SiO2 nanoparticles, thedispersionofthenanoparticlesinpolymermatrixis not homogenous and probably aggregation has been formed (Fig. 16(c)).', '2582H.

Conclusion', 'The nanocomposite PPBI-based membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified and un-modified TiO2 and SiO2nanoparticles.

The acid doping level and proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes in dry conditions obtained from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI nanoparticles were the highest in comparison to PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV. Formation of nanocomposites with modified and un-modified nanoparticles resulted the increas-ing of tensile strengths. The decreasing in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness was widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inor-ganic reinforcement.

And polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared through radical polymerization of 1-vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface-vinylated nanoparticles. The polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were utilized as a functional additive to prepare PPBI/polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. Imida-zole and sulfonated vinylbenzene groups on the surface of modified nanoparticles forming linkages with PPBI chains, improved the compatibility between PPBI and nanoparticles, and enhanced the mechanical strength of the prepared nanocomposite membranes. The prepared nanocomposite membranes showed higher water uptake and acid doping levels comparing to PPBI. Also, after acid doping with phosphoric acid, nanocomposite membranes exhibited enhanced proton conductivity in comparison to the pristine PPBI and PPBI/un-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. The enhancement in proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes resulted from modified SiO2 nanoparticles showed higher conductivity than modified TiO2 nanoparticles. The above results indicated that the PPBI/modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for medium temperature fuel cells. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang-', '∗Corresponding author.

Sulfonated polysulfone (PSF) [4], polyetheretherketone (PEEK) [5,6] and polybenzimidazoles (PBIs) [7–11] are among poly-mers which can be used as alternatives for Nafion in PEFCs. Amongpolybenzimidazolederivatives,poly[2,2-5,5(m-phenylene)-bibenzimidazole](PBI),whichisalsocalled commercial polybenzimidazole have been used as a mem-brane material in PEMFCs. Having high chemical as well as thermal resistance and proton conductivity, polybenzimidazoles are great options to be used in the fuel cells with function at elevated temperatures above 100 ◦C [12]. PBIs should have enough proton conductivity so that it could be used as proton exchange membranes in the fuel cells. To achieve this purpose, they are usually doped with a sufficient acid like H3PO4 to an appropriate doping level [13]. Nanocomposite membranes are a new group of membranes which contain nanopar-ticles such as SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 and other compounds [14–21]. The introduction of nanoparticles into the membranes results in a considerable improvement in their features like mechani-cal properties, methanol permeability, but in some cases leads to a decrease in proton conductivity [22–24]. In order to over-come this problem, surface functionalized nanoparticles, which means various compounds with polar groups grafted chemically', '0378-7753/$ – see front matter © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The reaction of PPBI synthesis.', 'to the surface of the nanoparticles [25–28], were used. As men-tioned before, the numerous research works were done concerning grafting various compounds on the SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles which used for different purposes. However, in this work, we have used monomer bearing functional groups like imidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene which can improve the properties of pro-ton conductive membranes. These monomers are polymerized on the surface of the nanoparticles and as a consequence, they can more affect the properties of the membranes than while one functional group is grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. In addition, the polymerization of the selected monomers such as vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface of nanoparticle could cause more compatibility between nanopar-ticles and polymer matrix which finally improve the mechanical properties. In this work, nanocomposite membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles and newly synthesized polybenzimidazole was depicted poly[2,2-5,5-(m-pyrazolidene)-bibenzimidazole] (PPBI). Modification of the mentioned nanoparticles was performed by radical polymerization of some vinyl monomers such as sulfonated styrene and vinylim-idazole on the surface of the nanoparticles to which vinylic group was bounded covalently. Also, the effect of surface modification on the properties of the nanocomposite membranes such as pro-ton conductivity, mechanical properties and water uptake were studied.', '2. Experimental', '2.1.

After reaction completion, the vis-cose mixture was precipitated in water. It was then separated, neutralized with sodium hydroxide solution (10% w/w), washed thoroughly with water and dried in a vacuum oven for 24 h at 60 ◦C to obtain PPBI.', '2.3. Modification of TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles', 'One gram of TiO2 nanoparticles dried at 100 ◦C under vacuum was added into a 250 mL flask containing 100 mL of dry THF and 10 mL of dried trichlorovinylsilane (coupling agent) under argon atmosphere. The resulting dispersion was stirred at room tempera-ture for 48 h. After completion of the reaction, the surface vinylated TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2-vinylated) were separated and washed with THF several times to remove un-reacted trichlorovinylsilane. After drying of the resultant powder at 80 ◦C for 24 h under vacuum, 1.5 g of the dry vinylated TiO2, 0.64 g 2,2′-azobis (isobutyronitrile) (AIBN) and 100 mL of dry DMF were added in to a 250 mL three-necked flask under argon atmosphere equipped with a condenser and stirred for 1 h at 75 ◦C and followed by drop-wise addition of 25 mL of vinylimidazole monomer to the mixture. At the end of the reaction, 50 mL of DMF was added to the mixture followed by stir-ring for 1 h at room temperature. After separation with centrifuge, the obtained powder (TiO2-PVI) was washed several times with NaCl (0.1 M) solution and de-ionized water respectively, in order to remove the un-grafted polyvinylimidazole (PVI) chains from the surface. In order to prepare TiO2 nanoparticles modified by poly (sulfonated vinylbenzene) (TiO2-PSV), 12.5 g of sulfonated vinyl-benzene was dissolved in dry DMSO and then added to the mixture of 1.5 g of vinylated TiO2 nanoparticles, 100 mL of DMSO and 1.0 g of AIBN at 75 ◦C under argon atmosphere while stirring. After 18 h, the obtained powder (TiO2-PSV) was separated by centrifuge and washed several times with DMSO and ethanol and then dried at 60 ◦C under vacuum for 6 h.

These prove the existence of polymeric chains that are grafted onto the nanoparticle surface. FT-IR spectra of the modified nanoparticles have been measured after complete washing and drying. To be sure of the chemical bonding of all chains (not physical) onto the particle surface, some un-modified nanoparticles were mixed with polymeric solutions of PVI and PSV and were stirred for 1 h. After filtration, the washing method used to wash the modified nanoparticles, was applied to the resulting powder as well. The FT-IR spectrum of the obtained powder did not show any absorbent bands related to PVI and PSV chains. The absorbent bands, which existed in the spectrum of mod-ified nanoparticles, were not observed in this spectrum. So, it was indicated that the polymeric chains have been attached to the par-ticles surface via covalent bonds.', '3.2. Thermal analysis', 'Thermogravimetric analysis diagrams of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 5. Weight loss in 85 ◦C can be related to the release of physically absorbed water. In un-modified nanoparticles, the minor weight loss in elevated temperatures can be attributed to the loss of hydroxyl groups of the particle surface attached by covalent bonds. Weight loss in modified nanoparticles could be a result of thermal degradation of the polymeric chains grafted to the surface of the nanoparti-cles. Also, the weight loss in 230–300 ◦C was due to the thermal decomposition of the sulfonate groups in the grafted PSV chains [30].

The remaining weight percentage in 850 ◦C is related to the modified TiO2 that is less than the added amount of PVI-modified TiO2 nanoparticles when the membrane was prepared. This decrease in weight in comparison with the theoretical amount could be related due to the degradation of the chains grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. Also, in order to obtain the par-ticular weight of the modified nanoparticles, specific amounts of modified and un-modified nanoparticles were weighed after and before complete burning out all the polymers. They were heated to temperatures about 1000 ◦C for 30 min and the obtained nanoparti-cles were weighed immediately.

The obtained results and theoretical amounts are shown in Table 1. The amounts of the obtained results in all cases are more than theoretical values. This could be related to the presence of free water molecules and hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticles surface in which their values are not subtracted from theoretical values. The diagrams of thermogravimetric analysis of both PPBI and nanocomposites prepared from the modified nanoparticles (10% w/w) are shown in Fig. 7. The weight loss observed in the tempera-ture range of 50–140 ◦C is a result of the release of water adsorbed into the membranes which is less significant in nanocomposites in comparison to pure membrane. The second loss in weight, observed at the temperature range of 500–530 ◦C, is also attributed to the thermal degradation of poly-meric backbone of the nanocomposite membranes which is almost identical to the degradation temperature of pure PPBI. As a result, the addition of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles do not have any noticeable effect on thermal stability of the prepared nanocomposites. As it is observed in Fig. 7, the degradation of PVI-modified nanoparticles occurs at 185 ◦C which is lower than the related tem-perature of PSV-modified ones.

Addition of silica nanoparticles to PPBI membranes increased their water uptakes due to the hygroscopic nature of SiO2 and TiO2nanoparticles. The sulfonic and imidazole groups in the nanopar-ticles increased the water uptake to a greater extent. The amount of water uptake for PPBI/TiO2-PSV, PPBI/SiO2-PSV, PPBI/TiO2-PVI and PPBI/SiO2-PVI are 21.6, 22.7, 20.4 and 21.9%, respectively. The effect of sulfonic acid groups of PSV chains grafted onto the nanoparticle surface on the water uptake is more than imidazole groups in PVI chains due to the higher hygroscopic properties of PSV comparing to PVI chains grafted on to the silica nanopar-ticle surface. The water uptake of PPBI/SiO2-PSV is higher than PPBI/TiO2-PSV which can be due to the further increase of the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles in comparison to TiO2 nanoparticle surface. The PPBI-based membranes were doped with 85% H3PO4 to prepare the acid-doped membranes. Fig. 9 shows the acid-doping levels of the PPBI-based nanocomposite membranes.

Among the prepared nanocomposites, the water uptake in PPBI/SiO2-PSV and acid doping in PPBI/SiO2-PVI were the most one. Even in the comparison of these membranes with the simi-lar ones which prepared from modified TiO2 such as PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, the amount of water uptake and doping level were higher.

As an example, for saturated steam the pressure cor-responding to 120 ◦C is 205 kPa.

On the other hand, comparing the pristine PPBI and Nafion®', '117 membranes, the relatively high proton conductivities of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles are noteworthy [32]. Li et al. have used sulfonated organosilica to modify Nafion® membranes and they found that the proton con-ductivities of the modified membranes were still lower than that of the neat Nafion® membrane. The reduction in the proton conductivity was attributed to the silica-induced changes in the tortuous paths and in the dis-tribution of hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains. However, in this work an enhancing effect on the proton conductivity was observed with addition of PSV and PVI grafted nanoparticles to PPBI mem-brane. The sulfonic and imidazole groups of modified nanoparticles also contribute in the acid-doping effect to PPBI polymer so as to enhance the proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles. Moreover, the presence of modified nanoparticles induces proton conductive pathways lead-ing to an increase in the proton conductivities of PPBI/modified nanoparticles membranes [24]. The proton conductivities of the acid-doped nanocompos-ite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 12) were further', 'Fig. 12. Proton conductivities of PPBI based nanocomposite membranes containing SiO2 (a) and TiO2 (b) nanoparticles at dry environment up to 145 ◦C.', 'studied at high temperatures under an anhydrous environment. All the PPBI/modified nanoparticle membranes still exhibited higher proton conductivities than the pristine acid-doped PPBI membrane. Generally, two principle mechanisms of vehicle mechanism and Grotthuss mechanism (hopping) describe proton diffusion through the membrane [33]. It is possible that the bounded water par-ticipates by the Grotthuss mechanism, and the free water takes part mostly by vehicle mechanism [34]. Addition of silica-SO3H to the membranes increases the bounded water content in the membranes (Fig. 13). The bounded water facilitates the proton transport ability through the Grotthuss mechanism, originating by generation of a continuous proton conductive pathway. There-fore, the high proton conductivity of PPBI/modified nanoparticles can be attributed to the high bounded water content in the membrane. Since the Grotthuss-type diffusion mechanism without assis-tance of the vehicle mechanism has been proposed for the protonconductionunderanhydrousenvironments[35,36], theprotonconductivityoftheacid-dopedPPBI/modified nanoparticlemembranescouldbesynergisticallyresulted from their modified nanoparticle contents and the acid-doping levels.

Proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PSV-modified nanoparticles shows significant increase in comparison to PVI-modified ones in low temperature and high rel-ative humidity. But in high temperature and low relative humidity, proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PVI-modified nanoparticles is observed to be more than PSV-modified ones and even at 145 ◦C the proton conductivity of PPBI/SiO2-PVI 15% is more than PPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%. The exis-tence of modified nanoparticles in PPBI nanocomposite membranes results in high proton conductivity in three ways:', '1) With increase in water uptake 2) With increase in the amount of doping level and 3) With increase in the number of proton conductive functional groups such as sulfonic acid group.', 'In PSV-modified nanocomposite membranes, acid doping decreases while the water uptake and the number of sulfonic acid groups shows an increase. Consequently, high proton conductiv-ity can be a result of these changes. It should be mentioned that in temperatures higher than 100 ◦C and in very low relative humidity, water uptake of PSV-modified membranes decreases which leads to low efficiency of the sulfonic groups attached onto the surface of the nanoparticles which in turn results in a decrease in proton conduc-tivity in both membranes, but the increase in proton conductivity resulting from high doping level is significant and also the proton conductivity of PVI-modified nanocomposite membranes increase in high temperatures. It is noteworthy that Nafion® 117 shows relatively low pro-ton conductivities under anhydrous conditions and almost lacks its proton conductivities at high temperatures.

Introduction of modified and un-modified nanoparticles increases the brittleness of the nanocomposite mem-branes with a decrease in their elongations at break. The effects of modified and unmodified nanoparticles on the elongations at break of the nanocomposite membranes were different. The decrease in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness were widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inorganic reinforcement [37–39].

Comparing the brittleness of the nanocomposite membranes of the PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/SiO2-PVI with PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, respectively indicates that the brittleness of the membranes prepared with modified SiO2 nanoparticles is less than the modified TiO2 ones.', '3.6.

And polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared through radical polymerization of 1-vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface-vinylated nanoparticles. The polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were utilized as a functional additive to prepare PPBI/polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes.

The prepared nanocomposite membranes showed higher water uptake and acid doping levels comparing to PPBI. Also, after acid doping with phosphoric acid, nanocomposite membranes exhibited enhanced proton conductivity in comparison to the pristine PPBI and PPBI/un-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. The enhancement in proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes resulted from modified SiO2 nanoparticles showed higher conductivity than modified TiO2 nanoparticles.

Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang-', '∗Corresponding author.

Having high chemical as well as thermal resistance and proton conductivity, polybenzimidazoles are great options to be used in the fuel cells with function at elevated temperatures above 100 ◦C [12]. PBIs should have enough proton conductivity so that it could be used as proton exchange membranes in the fuel cells. To achieve this purpose, they are usually doped with a sufficient acid like H3PO4 to an appropriate doping level [13]. Nanocomposite membranes are a new group of membranes which contain nanopar-ticles such as SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 and other compounds [14–21]. The introduction of nanoparticles into the membranes results in a considerable improvement in their features like mechani-cal properties, methanol permeability, but in some cases leads to a decrease in proton conductivity [22–24].

However, in this work, we have used monomer bearing functional groups like imidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene which can improve the properties of pro-ton conductive membranes. These monomers are polymerized on the surface of the nanoparticles and as a consequence, they can more affect the properties of the membranes than while one functional group is grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. In addition, the polymerization of the selected monomers such as vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface of nanoparticle could cause more compatibility between nanopar-ticles and polymer matrix which finally improve the mechanical properties.

These prove the existence of polymeric chains that are grafted onto the nanoparticle surface. FT-IR spectra of the modified nanoparticles have been measured after complete washing and drying. To be sure of the chemical bonding of all chains (not physical) onto the particle surface, some un-modified nanoparticles were mixed with polymeric solutions of PVI and PSV and were stirred for 1 h. After filtration, the washing method used to wash the modified nanoparticles, was applied to the resulting powder as well. The FT-IR spectrum of the obtained powder did not show any absorbent bands related to PVI and PSV chains. The absorbent bands, which existed in the spectrum of mod-ified nanoparticles, were not observed in this spectrum. So, it was indicated that the polymeric chains have been attached to the par-ticles surface via covalent bonds.', '3.2. Thermal analysis', 'Thermogravimetric analysis diagrams of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 5. Weight loss in 85 ◦C can be related to the release of physically absorbed water. In un-modified nanoparticles, the minor weight loss in elevated temperatures can be attributed to the loss of hydroxyl groups of the particle surface attached by covalent bonds. Weight loss in modified nanoparticles could be a result of thermal degradation of the polymeric chains grafted to the surface of the nanoparti-cles. Also, the weight loss in 230–300 ◦C was due to the thermal decomposition of the sulfonate groups in the grafted PSV chains [30].

The remaining weight percentage in 850 ◦C is related to the modified TiO2 that is less than the added amount of PVI-modified TiO2 nanoparticles when the membrane was prepared. This decrease in weight in comparison with the theoretical amount could be related due to the degradation of the chains grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. Also, in order to obtain the par-ticular weight of the modified nanoparticles, specific amounts of modified and un-modified nanoparticles were weighed after and before complete burning out all the polymers. They were heated to temperatures about 1000 ◦C for 30 min and the obtained nanoparti-cles were weighed immediately.

The obtained results and theoretical amounts are shown in Table 1. The amounts of the obtained results in all cases are more than theoretical values. This could be related to the presence of free water molecules and hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticles surface in which their values are not subtracted from theoretical values. The diagrams of thermogravimetric analysis of both PPBI and nanocomposites prepared from the modified nanoparticles (10% w/w) are shown in Fig. 7. The weight loss observed in the tempera-ture range of 50–140 ◦C is a result of the release of water adsorbed into the membranes which is less significant in nanocomposites in comparison to pure membrane. The second loss in weight, observed at the temperature range of 500–530 ◦C, is also attributed to the thermal degradation of poly-meric backbone of the nanocomposite membranes which is almost identical to the degradation temperature of pure PPBI. As a result, the addition of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles do not have any noticeable effect on thermal stability of the prepared nanocomposites. As it is observed in Fig. 7, the degradation of PVI-modified nanoparticles occurs at 185 ◦C which is lower than the related tem-perature of PSV-modified ones.

Water uptake and doping level', 'Water uptake amount of nanocomposite membranes contain-ing 5, 10 and 15% of modified nanoparticles at 25 ◦C are shown in Fig. 8. Addition of silica nanoparticles to PPBI membranes increased their water uptakes due to the hygroscopic nature of SiO2 and TiO2nanoparticles. The sulfonic and imidazole groups in the nanopar-ticles increased the water uptake to a greater extent. The amount of water uptake for PPBI/TiO2-PSV, PPBI/SiO2-PSV, PPBI/TiO2-PVI and PPBI/SiO2-PVI are 21.6, 22.7, 20.4 and 21.9%, respectively. The effect of sulfonic acid groups of PSV chains grafted onto the nanoparticle surface on the water uptake is more than imidazole groups in PVI chains due to the higher hygroscopic properties of PSV comparing to PVI chains grafted on to the silica nanopar-ticle surface. The water uptake of PPBI/SiO2-PSV is higher than PPBI/TiO2-PSV which can be due to the further increase of the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles in comparison to TiO2 nanoparticle surface.

On the other hand, comparing the pristine PPBI and Nafion®', '117 membranes, the relatively high proton conductivities of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles are noteworthy [32]. Li et al. have used sulfonated organosilica to modify Nafion® membranes and they found that the proton con-ductivities of the modified membranes were still lower than that of the neat Nafion® membrane. The reduction in the proton conductivity was attributed to the silica-induced changes in the tortuous paths and in the dis-tribution of hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains. However, in this work an enhancing effect on the proton conductivity was observed with addition of PSV and PVI grafted nanoparticles to PPBI mem-brane. The sulfonic and imidazole groups of modified nanoparticles also contribute in the acid-doping effect to PPBI polymer so as to enhance the proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles. Moreover, the presence of modified nanoparticles induces proton conductive pathways lead-ing to an increase in the proton conductivities of PPBI/modified nanoparticles membranes [24]. The proton conductivities of the acid-doped nanocompos-ite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 12) were further', 'Fig. 12. Proton conductivities of PPBI based nanocomposite membranes containing SiO2 (a) and TiO2 (b) nanoparticles at dry environment up to 145 ◦C.', 'studied at high temperatures under an anhydrous environment. All the PPBI/modified nanoparticle membranes still exhibited higher proton conductivities than the pristine acid-doped PPBI membrane. Generally, two principle mechanisms of vehicle mechanism and Grotthuss mechanism (hopping) describe proton diffusion through the membrane [33]. It is possible that the bounded water par-ticipates by the Grotthuss mechanism, and the free water takes part mostly by vehicle mechanism [34]. Addition of silica-SO3H to the membranes increases the bounded water content in the membranes (Fig. 13). The bounded water facilitates the proton transport ability through the Grotthuss mechanism, originating by generation of a continuous proton conductive pathway. There-fore, the high proton conductivity of PPBI/modified nanoparticles can be attributed to the high bounded water content in the membrane. Since the Grotthuss-type diffusion mechanism without assis-tance of the vehicle mechanism has been proposed for the protonconductionunderanhydrousenvironments[35,36], theprotonconductivityoftheacid-dopedPPBI/modified nanoparticlemembranescouldbesynergisticallyresulted from their modified nanoparticle contents and the acid-doping levels.

Proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PSV-modified nanoparticles shows significant increase in comparison to PVI-modified ones in low temperature and high rel-ative humidity. But in high temperature and low relative humidity, proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PVI-modified nanoparticles is observed to be more than PSV-modified ones and even at 145 ◦C the proton conductivity of PPBI/SiO2-PVI 15% is more than PPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%.

Consequently, high proton conductiv-ity can be a result of these changes. It should be mentioned that in temperatures higher than 100 ◦C and in very low relative humidity, water uptake of PSV-modified membranes decreases which leads to low efficiency of the sulfonic groups attached onto the surface of the nanoparticles which in turn results in a decrease in proton conduc-tivity in both membranes, but the increase in proton conductivity resulting from high doping level is significant and also the proton conductivity of PVI-modified nanocomposite membranes increase in high temperatures. It is noteworthy that Nafion® 117 shows relatively low pro-ton conductivities under anhydrous conditions and almost lacks its proton conductivities at high temperatures.

Introduction of modified and un-modified nanoparticles increases the brittleness of the nanocomposite mem-branes with a decrease in their elongations at break. The effects of modified and unmodified nanoparticles on the elongations at break of the nanocomposite membranes were different. The decrease in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness were widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inorganic reinforcement [37–39].

Comparing the brittleness of the nanocomposite membranes of the PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/SiO2-PVI with PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, respectively indicates that the brittleness of the membranes prepared with modified SiO2 nanoparticles is less than the modified TiO2 ones.', '3.6.

However, the dispersion homogeneity of silica nanoparticles in PPBI membranes could be significantly improved with using surface modified nanoparticles as the additives. As shown in Fig. 16(b), the dispersion homogeneity of modified nanoparticles is observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2 nanocomposite membrane, which demonstrates high compatibility between PPBI polymer and PSV-SiO2 nanoparticles and the high dispersion abil-ity of PSV-SiO2 in PPBI matrix. Particle agglomeration is still not observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2-10%. The ionic linkages between PPBI and modified nanoparticles are contributed to their higher compatibility [32]. However, in nanocompos-ite membranes prepared from un-modified SiO2 nanoparticles, thedispersionofthenanoparticlesinpolymermatrixis not homogenous and probably aggregation has been formed (Fig. 16(c)).', '2582H.

Conclusion', 'The nanocomposite PPBI-based membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified and un-modified TiO2 and SiO2nanoparticles. The thermal stability of the prepared nanocompos-', 'ite membranes was similar to PPBI membrane. The water uptake of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from TiO2/PSV and SiO2/PSV nanoparticles were higher than other nanocomposite membranes. The acid doping level and proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes in dry conditions obtained from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI nanoparticles were the highest in comparison to PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV. Formation of nanocomposites with modified and un-modified nanoparticles resulted the increas-ing of tensile strengths. The decreasing in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness was widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inor-ganic reinforcement. The high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicated that this membrane could be utilized as a proton exchange membrane for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. M.-G.

Polyethersulfone (PES)–beta zeolite/PES–Al2O3 dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fiber membranes with enhanced separation performance have been fab-ricated. This study presents an innovative approach of utilizing low cost PES and Al2O3 to replace expensive polyimides as the supporting medium for dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fibers and eliminating inter-layer de-lamination problems. The incorporations of 20 wt% beta zeolite in the outer selective layer and 60 wt% Al2O3 in the inner layer coupled with spinning at high elongational draw ratios yield membranes with an O2/N2 selectivity of 6.89. The presence of Al2O3 particles enables the membrane to retain its porous substructure morphology in the course of annealing above the glass transition temperature of PES. Moreover, spinning at high elongational draw ratios results in the re-distribution of Al2O3 particles towards both edges of the inner layer. Not only do the permeance and selectivity of the fibers increase, but also greater mechanical properties and lower degree of shrinkages are obtained. Therefore, the com-bination of PES–beta zeolite and PES–Al2O3 nanoparticles with a reasonable draw ratio may be another promising approach to produce hollow fibers with double-layer mixed-matrix materials. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction', 'The intelligent incorporation of inorganic fillers within a con-tinuous polymeric matrix represents a promising approach to attain superior gas separation performance that surpasses the Robeson trade-off line for permeability and permselectivity [1–3]. Recently, the application of mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) for gas separation has attracted worldwide interest due to the potentially synergetic effects that can be reaped. To date, several research groups have demonstrated the feasibility of some molec-ularly engineered MMMs in flat, dense forms which comprised of inorganic particles like zeolites, carbon molecular sieves and others [1,2,4–16]. Nevertheless, the technical difficulties encoun-tered in fabricating continuous and defect-free flat asymmetric or hollow fiber membranes hinder the progress of utilizing these organic–inorganic hybrids for industrial applications [17–21]. Therefore, a significant breakthrough on fabricating MMMs in use-ful configurations is undoubtedly essential and this signifies one immediate challenge for membrane researchers.', '∗Corresponding author. Fax: +65 67791936. E-mail address: chencts@nus.edu.sg (T.-S. Chung).', 'In view of the desirable characteristics like larger surface-to-volume ratio and higher flux, asymmetric hollow fiber membrane is the preferred configuration for use in gas separation [22–27]. There-fore, further comprehensive research on MMMs should be devoted to the successful integration of inorganic particles to polymeric-based hollow fiber membranes. Pioneering works on single-layer mixed-matrix hollow fiber membranes have revealed the need of a new fabrication approach that reduces material costs and provides greater flexibility for further modifications and improvements [28]. MMMs production by means of dual layer co-extrusion spinning technology opens up more application opportunities [28–33]. The exploitation of this technique effectively reduces fabrication costs and facilitates the control of inorganic particle distribution, i.e., introducing inorganic fillers primarily to the thin selective layer. A novel approach for controlling the distribution of inorganic nanoparticles in the outer skin of dual-layer mixed-matrix hol-low fibers was first proposed in our early work by Jiang et al. [28]. The key factors influencing the nanoparticle distribution are: (1) shear within the spinneret, (2) die swell following dope extrusion from the annulus spinneret and (3) elongational drawing in the air gap. Subsequently, the fabrication of dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fiber membranes were further developed by Chung and co-workers [29–31]. Currently, there exists a major challenge faced', '0376-7388/$ – see front matter © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.memsci.2008.07.046', 'N. Widjojo et al. / Journal of Membrane Science 325 (2008) 326–335327', 'by researchers in fabricating dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fiber membranes for gas separation. The conventional phase inversion process makes it difficult to obtain a mixed-matrix selective layer without severe polymer/particle interfacial voids. The presence of these undesirable interfacial voids diminishes the gas separation performance of MMMs and hence, this problem needs to be recti-fied. In view of the anticipated requirement for post-treatment to reduce or eliminate interfacial voids, the material selection for the inner and outer layers is important. Typically, the working poly-mers for the outer and inner layers should have a vast difference in their glass transition temperatures (Tg). In particular, the Tgof the polymer constituting the support layer should be signifi-cantly higher than the polymer used for the mixed-matrix layer. This allows the subsequent heat treatment to reduce or elimi-nate voids in the selective mixed-matrix layer without increasing the substructure resistance of the support layer [29–31]. Similar heat treatments may be utilized to eradicate the problem of de-lamination occurring between the inner and outer layers. Therefore, the related works on dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fiber mem-branes reported by Chung and co-workers’ group [28–31] typically employ glassy polymers with relatively low Tg (e.g. polysulfone (PSf) and polyethersulfone (PES)) for the mixed-matrix layer, while glassy polyimides with high Tg (e.g. Matrimid and P84) are used for the support layer. From the engineering point of view, this approach has solved the problem of interfacial voids effectively. However, it is certainly not practical from the economical aspect since higher production cost is incurred as a result of using costly polyimides (e.g. approximately ∼USD 550/kg Matrimid) for the support layer. This raises an issue of whether the costly polymer can be replaced with a cheaper alternative, hence the primary goal in our present study. In the previous works on dual-layer hollow fiber membranes by Widjojo et al. [34,35], an indented dual-layer spinneret was invented to reduce the interlayer de-lamination [34] and Al2O3nanoparticles were introduced into the inner support layer [34,35] to minimize its shrinkage and densification during heat treatment while retaining porous structure. It is found that the combination of the indented spinneret and inorganic nanoparticles synergisti-cally results in MMMs with enhanced mechanical properties, faster spinning speed, looser substructure resistance, and greater overall separation performance.

The as-spun dual-layer hollow fiber membranes were cut into pieces of approximately 30 cm and immersed in a clean water bath for 2 days. The fibers were solvent-exchanged by three consecutive 30-min immersions in a methanol circulation. The same procedure then was repeated using n-hexane. Finally, these fibers were dried in air at ambient temperature.', '2.2.3. Post-treatment protocols Two post-treatment methods, namely heat treatment and two-step coatings were applied to eliminate voids created between nanoparticles and polymer matrix on the outer surface of dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fiber membranes. Heat treatment processes were performed in a precise high-temperature programmable fur-nace (CenturionTM Neytech Qex). Its procedure was to anneal the as-spun fibers from room temperature to a high temperature (200, 220, 235, 240 or 245 ◦C) at a heating rate of 0.6 ◦C/min under vac-uum; then hold them for 2 h before cooling down naturally. The other method was a two-step coating approach invented by DuPont scientists [40] which has been investigated systematically by Jiang et al. [29]. The coating solution included (1) 0.2 wt% diethyl-toluenediamine in iso-octane and (2) a mixture of 0.2 wt% of 1,3,5-benzenetricarbonyl chloride and 2 wt% silicon rubber in iso-octane.

The line scan spectrum of energy dispersion of X-ray (EDX) was applied in the SEM samples to determine the particle distribu-tion profile in the inner-layer cross-section area of dual-layer hollow fiber membranes. Furthermore, the Young’s modulus of dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fibers with varying Al2O3 nanopar-ticle loadings in the inner layer was characterized using Instron 5542. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fibers was analyzed with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) on a Mettler-Toledo DSC 822e. A small piece of fiber was weighed and placed into aluminium DSC pans. The tested samples were heated from 25 to 300 ◦C at a heating rate of 10 ◦C/min in the first DSC cycle to remove thermal history; then held for 10 min at 300 ◦C and cooled from 300 to 25 ◦C at the rate of 20 ◦C/min;', 'finally repeated the above procedure for the second cycle.

Results and discussion', '3.1. Morphology of as-spun dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fibers', 'The typical morphology of as-spun PES–beta zeolite/PES–Al2O3mixed-matrix dual-layer hollow fibers is illustrated in Fig. 1 (sam-ple ID: A2). It can be observed that the as-spun fiber utilizing the same polymer material, i.e., PES, shows a de-lamination-free structure with a porous supporting layer. Although the defects between polymer and beta zeolite particle in the outer layer’s outer surface are almost invisible at a magnification of 50,000 (i.e., the left-upper SEM picture) but an interfacial gap between the polymer and beta zeolite in the outer layer’s edge (i.e., the right-bottom picture) can be obviously observed. Normally in the dual-layer mixed-matrix fibers, heat treatment has been a com-mon method to reduce or eliminate the voids between polymer matrix and particles [29–31]. However, it is not possible for hol-low fibers made from the same PES polymer matrix in both layers to withstand high-temperature heat treatment above the Tg of PES without severe damage. In order to overcome this problem, two approaches are undertaken in this work as follows: (1) the addition of Al2O3 nanoparticles in the inner layer to enhance the mechanical strength as well as retain a porous substructure after heat treat-ment; and (2) the use of high elongation draw ratio to properly shift the particle distribution to critical locations across the inner layer.', 'N.

On the contrary, fibers spun with 50 or 60 wt% Al2O3loading retain their porous substructure even after heat treatment at 240 ◦C. Therefore, fibers made from 60 wt% Al2O3 loading were chosen for further studies.', 'Table 2 summarizes the effect of different Al2O3 nanoparticle loadings on gas separation performance of dual-layer mixed-matrix fibers for free-fall samples A1–A4. All fibers show Knudsen dif-fusion selectivity before any post-treatment, thus heat treatment above the Tg of polymer and two-step coatings were applied to the as-spun fibers. For Al2O3 embedded samples post-treated at the same temperature, their permeance increases with an increase in Al2O3 nanoparticle loadings in the inner layer. However, no permeance can be detected for the post-annealed dual-layer fibers that contain no Al2O3 nanoparticle because of significant structure densification after heat treatment at elevated temper-atures. In comparison to the intrinsic O2/N2 selectivity (6.4) of the PES–zeolite beta mixed-matrix flat dense membranes [30], the dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fiber with 40 wt% Al2O3 nanoparti-cle loading shows a much lower O2/N2 selectivity of 1.33–1.77 with an unimpressive O2 permeance when the heat treatment took place', 'at 235 ◦C and above. This is due to the fact that the substructure resistance in the inner layer comes into effect after heat treatment and hence results in a simultaneous reduction in both permeance and selectivity, which has been proven by SEM images in Fig. 2. On the other hand, the dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fiber contain-ing 50–60 wt% Al2O3 nanoparticles achieves an O2/N2 comparable to or slightly surpassing that of the PES–beta zeolite mixed-matrix flat dense membranes and has a higher permeance than those with lower Al2O3 loadings when heat treated at similar temperatures. This phenomenon arises from the fact that higher Al2O3 loadings could retain the porous substructure during heat treatment and thus lead to insignificant substructure resistance. Further charac-terizations, i.e., measurements of mechanical strength and degree of shrinkage, will be discussed later to demonstrate the above spec-ulation.', '3.3. Effect of outer layer thickness on gas separation performance', 'The main function of the outer layer is to provide a dense-selective layer for gas separation. By means of adjusting the outer layer dope flow rate while keeping the other spinning parame-ters constant, one may tailor the mixed-matrix outer layer as thin as possible to obtain high permeance [36]. However, there is a limitation in reducing the thickness of the outer layer since the mixed-matrix outer layer consists of beta zeolite with a particle size in the range of 250–300 nm. Table 3 compares the gas separation performance of dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fibers as a function of outer-layer dope flow rates. Both permeance and selectivity are further enhanced when the outer layer dope flow rate decreases from 0.2 to 0.075 ml/min.

From this point of view, it seems that the selectivity enhancement for the two gas pairs contra-dicts the ideal molecular sieving mechanism. However, the results are consistent with the previous reports because there are several mechanisms involved in selectivity improvement [10,14,15,42,43]; namely, (1) polymer chain rigidification near the particles; (2) pore opening reduction due to the partial pore blockage; (3) the orienta-tion of the pore opening of the beta zeolite in the fiber’s outer layer relatively to the direction of gas flow. A further decrease in outer-layer dope flow rate to 0.05 ml/min results in O2/N2 selectivity in the range of Knudsen diffusion even after thermal treatment for samples before two step coating. This might be due to the fact that more defects are created on the outer surface when the outer layer thickness becomes thinner. As a result, the fibers cannot show high permselectivity because their defects are beyond repaired by means of heat treatment and two step coat-ing methods. Since the newly developed dual-layer double-mixed-matrix hollow fiber membranes have comparable performance to those dual-layer single-mixed-matrix ones using P84 as the inner-layer material [31], the combination of PES–beta zeolite and PES–Al2O3nanoparticles with a proper outer-layer dope flow rate may be a promising approach to replace highly expensive polyimide mate-rials with high Tg as a porous inner layer in the fabrication of mixed-matrix dual-layer hollow fibers.', '3.4. Thermal, rheology and mechanical properties of PES–beta zeolite/PES–Al2O3 dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fibers', 'Since heat treatment is applied to the fibers, it shows shrinkage in both radial and longitudinal directions. Fig. 3 shows the radial direction shrinkage. With the addition of Al2O3 nanoparticles into the inner layer, the dual-layer fiber has a less degree of shrinkage during heat treatment as compared to those fibers containing no particles. The degree of shrinkage in the transversal direction is defined as follows [35]:', 'DS = OD before heat treatment −OD after heat treatment', 'OD before heat treatment× 100%', 'Fig. 3. % Shrinkage of the outer diameter of the fibers as a function of heat treatment temperature (2 h) and Al2O3 particle loadings. % Shrinkage =(OD before heat treatment −OD after heat treatment)/OD before heat treatment ×100', 'where DS is the degree of shrinkage, and OD is the outer diameter of the inner layer of the dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fiber mem-branes. A possible explanation for the reduction of the degree of fiber shrinkage during heat-treatment is due to the rigidification of PES chains induced by the Al2O3 nanoparticles [7,8]. Table 4 indi-cates that the Tg of the fiber increases with an increase in Al2O3nanoparticle loading, which provides strong evidence for chain rigidification. Furthermore, Table 4 also shows that the inner-layer dope viscosity increases with an increase of Al2O3 particle loadings. Thus the degree of shrinkage decreases with an increase in parti-cle loadings due to the increment in solid density. In addition, the particles which act as a hindrance among polymer chain reduce the shrinkage. This observation supports our hypothesis that the addition of Al2O3 nanoparticles in the inner layer can prevent the fiber from severe densification and shape deformation during high-temperature heat treatment.', 'Table 4 shows the effects of the addition of Al2O3 nanoparti-cles on mechanical properties of the free-fall spun fibers (sample ID: A1 to A4).

The highest O2 permeance is 0.241 with O2/N2 selectivity of 6.89 at an elongational draw ratio of 14.7 after heat treatment at 240 ◦C and two-step coatings. However, the use of two-step coatings procedure alone without applying heat treatment could not seal the defects. This might be due to the defects between particle and polymer still beyond the curing range of two-step coatings. The superiority of two-step coatings over one step one, i.e., silicon rubber coating, to cure defects in the mixed-matrix dual-layer hollow fibers has been demonstrated and discussed in details by Jiang et al.

Following their work, Jiang et al. [1] have suc-cessfully applied the two-step coating method to seal the defects in their dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fibers. As compared to the common silicon rubber coating, it has shown a more supe-rior gas separation performance. Two possible reasons might be due to: (1) the defects between particles and the polymer are still beyond the curing range of silicon rubber coating; (2) the hydrophobic silicon rubber may partially detach from the surface of the hydrophilic zeolite. The introduction of the reactive chemicals tends to form some stable structures between the particle surface and the polymer matrix might help to tighten the hollow fiber sur-face structure as well as trap the silicon rubber in the gaps more effectively. The feasible interactions among the chemicals in the coating solutions, the zeolite particles, and the polysulfone are drawn in Fig. 4. Since the zeolite and polysulfone contain hydroxyl and sul-fone groups, respectively, it is thought that the amines in the', 'diethyltoluenediamines could induce the hydrogen bonding with the hydroxyl and sulfone groups. Besides the hydrogen bonding, the 1,3,5-benzenetricarbonyl chloride may react with the amine pro-ducing an amide group. Consequently, the network resulted from these two reactions help to narrow the gap between the particles and the polymer, which can trap the silicon rubber chains effec-tively. It has been proven in our previous works [28,35,44], that the particle distribution across the fiber’s wall transforms from a con-vex induced by the shear stress within the spinneret to a concave profiles induced by the elongation stress in the air gap region as the elongational draw ratio increases from a free-fall spinning to a high elongational draw spinning. In this work, we believe that there are two types of particle movements as a function of elongational draw ratio, namely: (1) migration of beta zeolite particles in the outer layer towards outer layer’s outer edge and (2) movement of Al2O3particles in the inner layer towards both edges, since two different particles were applied simultaneously in the outer and inner layers. The migration of both particles from the middle portion to the edge', 'Fig. 7.

In conjunction, SEM-EDX images of Al2O3 particles in the fiber’s cross-section in Fig. 6 further confirms that there is a shift in Al2O3particles from the middle part to both edges with an increase in elongation draw ratio. However, the aluminium (Al) intensity near the outer edge of fibers might as well include the Al content of beta zeolite, since it also consists of Al element. The effects of elonga-tional draw ratio on the number of particles in the outer surface, the AFM topology and mean roughness calculation (Ra) of the outer surface are shown in Fig. 7. It can be observed that the number of nanoparticles residing in the inner layer’s outer surface increases with an increase in elongational draw ratio. Simultaneously, the increment of mean roughness in the outer surface of fibers from 13.8 nm at ϕ = 4.5 to 67.9 nm at ϕ = 32.1 further supports the occur-rence of particle distribution movement when spinning at a high elongational draw ratio. The migration of nanoparticles towards the edge has multiple effects. It will results in more micro-defects beneath the PES–beta zeolite layer (as shown in right-bottom figure of Fig. 1); thus creates more channels for gas transportation and reduces the substruc-ture resistance. Since nanoparticles are accumulated towards both edges of the inner layer, elongated polymer chains would dom-inate in the middle part of the fiber cross-section. As a result, the fiber mechanical strength is improved and its shrinkage in the radial direction is reduced during heat treatment. Both the mechanical data tabulated in Table 6 and the degrees of thermal shrinkage shown in Fig. 8 confirm our hypotheses. All mechanical properties including tensile strength, Young’s modulus and elon-gation at break increase with an increase in elongation draw ratio from 4.5 to 14.7. Therefore, the combination of PES–beta zeolite and PES–Al2O3 nanoparticles with a reasonable draw ratio may be another promising approach to produce double-mixed-matrix hollow fibers.', 'Fig. 8. % Shrinkage of the outer diameter of the fibers as a function of heat treatment temperature (2 h) and elongation draw ratio. % Shrinkage =(OD before heat treatment −OD after heat treatment)/OD before heat treatment ×100', '4. Conclusions', 'PES–beta zeolite/PES–Al2O3 dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fibers with an enhanced gas separation performance and mechani-cal strength have been successfully fabricated using an economical polymer material, i.e., PES, as a substitute to an expensive polyimide material as the inner layer. Based on the gas separation results and characterizations in this work, the following conclusions can be drawn:', '(1) Two approaches to utilize the same polymer material for both layers, i.e., PES, in the fabrication of dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fibers are proposed as follows: (a) the addition of Al2O3nanoparticles in the inner layer to retain a porous structure of the fiber during heat treatment; (b) the use of a high elongation draw ratio to shift the particle distribution in the inner layer and enhance both gas separation performance and mechanical strength. (2) The dual-layer mixed-matrix hollow fibers with 50–60 wt% Al2O3 nanoparticle loadings can achieve the intrinsic selectiv-ity of the PES–beta zeolite mixed-matrix flat dense membranes with higher permeance as compared to those with lower Al2O3loadings, i.e., 0–40 wt% Al2O3 loadings when heat treated at similar temperatures due to a better porous substructure and a lower degree of shrinkage. (3) Both permeance and selectivity are further enhanced when the outer layer dope flow rate decreases from 0.2 to 0.075 ml/min. The thinnest dense-selective layer of dual-layer mixed-matrix fibers is 0.81 �m with O2/N2 of 6.63. (4) A significant enhancement in both permeance and selectivity has been achieved for those fibers spun at a higher elongation draw ratio with 60 wt% Al2O3 loading in the inner layer. The highest O2 permeance is 0.24 with O2/N2 selectivity of 6.89 at an elongation draw ratio of 14.7 after heat treatment at 240 ◦C and two-step coatings. (5) Spinning at high elongational draw ratios results in the re-distribution of Al2O3 particles towards both edges of the inner layer. Not only does permeance and selectivity increase, but also greater mechanical properties and lower degree of shrinkages are obtained. Therefore, the combination of PES–beta zeolite and PES–Al2O3 nanoparticles with a reasonable draw ratio may be another promising approach to produce double-mixed-matrix hollow fibers.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to thank the Singapore National Research Foundation (NRF) for her support on the Competitive Research Programme for the project entitled “Molecular Engineering of Membrane Materials: Research and Technology for Energy Devel-opment of Hydrogen, Natural Gas and Syngas” with grant number of R-279-000-261-281.

And polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared through radical polymerization of 1-vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface-vinylated nanoparticles. The polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were utilized as a functional additive to prepare PPBI/polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. Imida-zole and sulfonated vinylbenzene groups on the surface of modified nanoparticles forming linkages with PPBI chains, improved the compatibility between PPBI and nanoparticles, and enhanced the mechanical strength of the prepared nanocomposite membranes. The prepared nanocomposite membranes showed higher water uptake and acid doping levels comparing to PPBI. Also, after acid doping with phosphoric acid, nanocomposite membranes exhibited enhanced proton conductivity in comparison to the pristine PPBI and PPBI/un-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. The enhancement in proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes resulted from modified SiO2 nanoparticles showed higher conductivity than modified TiO2 nanoparticles.

Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang-', '∗Corresponding author.

Having high chemical as well as thermal resistance and proton conductivity, polybenzimidazoles are great options to be used in the fuel cells with function at elevated temperatures above 100 ◦C [12]. PBIs should have enough proton conductivity so that it could be used as proton exchange membranes in the fuel cells. To achieve this purpose, they are usually doped with a sufficient acid like H3PO4 to an appropriate doping level [13]. Nanocomposite membranes are a new group of membranes which contain nanopar-ticles such as SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 and other compounds [14–21]. The introduction of nanoparticles into the membranes results in a considerable improvement in their features like mechani-cal properties, methanol permeability, but in some cases leads to a decrease in proton conductivity [22–24].

However, in this work, we have used monomer bearing functional groups like imidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene which can improve the properties of pro-ton conductive membranes. These monomers are polymerized on the surface of the nanoparticles and as a consequence, they can more affect the properties of the membranes than while one functional group is grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. In addition, the polymerization of the selected monomers such as vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface of nanoparticle could cause more compatibility between nanopar-ticles and polymer matrix which finally improve the mechanical properties.

These prove the existence of polymeric chains that are grafted onto the nanoparticle surface. FT-IR spectra of the modified nanoparticles have been measured after complete washing and drying. To be sure of the chemical bonding of all chains (not physical) onto the particle surface, some un-modified nanoparticles were mixed with polymeric solutions of PVI and PSV and were stirred for 1 h. After filtration, the washing method used to wash the modified nanoparticles, was applied to the resulting powder as well. The FT-IR spectrum of the obtained powder did not show any absorbent bands related to PVI and PSV chains. The absorbent bands, which existed in the spectrum of mod-ified nanoparticles, were not observed in this spectrum. So, it was indicated that the polymeric chains have been attached to the par-ticles surface via covalent bonds.', '3.2. Thermal analysis', 'Thermogravimetric analysis diagrams of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 5. Weight loss in 85 ◦C can be related to the release of physically absorbed water. In un-modified nanoparticles, the minor weight loss in elevated temperatures can be attributed to the loss of hydroxyl groups of the particle surface attached by covalent bonds. Weight loss in modified nanoparticles could be a result of thermal degradation of the polymeric chains grafted to the surface of the nanoparti-cles. Also, the weight loss in 230–300 ◦C was due to the thermal decomposition of the sulfonate groups in the grafted PSV chains [30].

The remaining weight percentage in 850 ◦C is related to the modified TiO2 that is less than the added amount of PVI-modified TiO2 nanoparticles when the membrane was prepared. This decrease in weight in comparison with the theoretical amount could be related due to the degradation of the chains grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. Also, in order to obtain the par-ticular weight of the modified nanoparticles, specific amounts of modified and un-modified nanoparticles were weighed after and before complete burning out all the polymers. They were heated to temperatures about 1000 ◦C for 30 min and the obtained nanoparti-cles were weighed immediately.

The obtained results and theoretical amounts are shown in Table 1. The amounts of the obtained results in all cases are more than theoretical values. This could be related to the presence of free water molecules and hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticles surface in which their values are not subtracted from theoretical values. The diagrams of thermogravimetric analysis of both PPBI and nanocomposites prepared from the modified nanoparticles (10% w/w) are shown in Fig. 7. The weight loss observed in the tempera-ture range of 50–140 ◦C is a result of the release of water adsorbed into the membranes which is less significant in nanocomposites in comparison to pure membrane. The second loss in weight, observed at the temperature range of 500–530 ◦C, is also attributed to the thermal degradation of poly-meric backbone of the nanocomposite membranes which is almost identical to the degradation temperature of pure PPBI. As a result, the addition of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles do not have any noticeable effect on thermal stability of the prepared nanocomposites. As it is observed in Fig. 7, the degradation of PVI-modified nanoparticles occurs at 185 ◦C which is lower than the related tem-perature of PSV-modified ones.

Water uptake and doping level', 'Water uptake amount of nanocomposite membranes contain-ing 5, 10 and 15% of modified nanoparticles at 25 ◦C are shown in Fig. 8. Addition of silica nanoparticles to PPBI membranes increased their water uptakes due to the hygroscopic nature of SiO2 and TiO2nanoparticles. The sulfonic and imidazole groups in the nanopar-ticles increased the water uptake to a greater extent. The amount of water uptake for PPBI/TiO2-PSV, PPBI/SiO2-PSV, PPBI/TiO2-PVI and PPBI/SiO2-PVI are 21.6, 22.7, 20.4 and 21.9%, respectively. The effect of sulfonic acid groups of PSV chains grafted onto the nanoparticle surface on the water uptake is more than imidazole groups in PVI chains due to the higher hygroscopic properties of PSV comparing to PVI chains grafted on to the silica nanopar-ticle surface. The water uptake of PPBI/SiO2-PSV is higher than PPBI/TiO2-PSV which can be due to the further increase of the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles in comparison to TiO2 nanoparticle surface.

On the other hand, comparing the pristine PPBI and Nafion®', '117 membranes, the relatively high proton conductivities of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles are noteworthy [32]. Li et al. have used sulfonated organosilica to modify Nafion® membranes and they found that the proton con-ductivities of the modified membranes were still lower than that of the neat Nafion® membrane. The reduction in the proton conductivity was attributed to the silica-induced changes in the tortuous paths and in the dis-tribution of hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains. However, in this work an enhancing effect on the proton conductivity was observed with addition of PSV and PVI grafted nanoparticles to PPBI mem-brane. The sulfonic and imidazole groups of modified nanoparticles also contribute in the acid-doping effect to PPBI polymer so as to enhance the proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles. Moreover, the presence of modified nanoparticles induces proton conductive pathways lead-ing to an increase in the proton conductivities of PPBI/modified nanoparticles membranes [24].

Proton conductivities of PPBI based nanocomposite membranes containing SiO2 (a) and TiO2 (b) nanoparticles at dry environment up to 145 ◦C.', 'studied at high temperatures under an anhydrous environment. All the PPBI/modified nanoparticle membranes still exhibited higher proton conductivities than the pristine acid-doped PPBI membrane. Generally, two principle mechanisms of vehicle mechanism and Grotthuss mechanism (hopping) describe proton diffusion through the membrane [33]. It is possible that the bounded water par-ticipates by the Grotthuss mechanism, and the free water takes part mostly by vehicle mechanism [34]. Addition of silica-SO3H to the membranes increases the bounded water content in the membranes (Fig. 13). The bounded water facilitates the proton transport ability through the Grotthuss mechanism, originating by generation of a continuous proton conductive pathway. There-fore, the high proton conductivity of PPBI/modified nanoparticles can be attributed to the high bounded water content in the membrane. Since the Grotthuss-type diffusion mechanism without assis-tance of the vehicle mechanism has been proposed for the protonconductionunderanhydrousenvironments[35,36], theprotonconductivityoftheacid-dopedPPBI/modified nanoparticlemembranescouldbesynergisticallyresulted from their modified nanoparticle contents and the acid-doping levels.

Proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PSV-modified nanoparticles shows significant increase in comparison to PVI-modified ones in low temperature and high rel-ative humidity.

Consequently, high proton conductiv-ity can be a result of these changes. It should be mentioned that in temperatures higher than 100 ◦C and in very low relative humidity, water uptake of PSV-modified membranes decreases which leads to low efficiency of the sulfonic groups attached onto the surface of the nanoparticles which in turn results in a decrease in proton conduc-tivity in both membranes, but the increase in proton conductivity resulting from high doping level is significant and also the proton conductivity of PVI-modified nanocomposite membranes increase in high temperatures. It is noteworthy that Nafion® 117 shows relatively low pro-ton conductivities under anhydrous conditions and almost lacks its proton conductivities at high temperatures.

Introduction of modified and un-modified nanoparticles increases the brittleness of the nanocomposite mem-branes with a decrease in their elongations at break. The effects of modified and unmodified nanoparticles on the elongations at break of the nanocomposite membranes were different. The decrease in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness were widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inorganic reinforcement [37–39].

Comparing the brittleness of the nanocomposite membranes of the PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/SiO2-PVI with PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, respectively indicates that the brittleness of the membranes prepared with modified SiO2 nanoparticles is less than the modified TiO2 ones.', '3.6.

The compatibility between PPBI and unmodified nanoparticles and the homogene-ity of the PPBI/SiO2 or PPBI/TiO2 membranes are somewhat poor [32]. However, the dispersion homogeneity of silica nanoparticles in PPBI membranes could be significantly improved with using surface modified nanoparticles as the additives. As shown in Fig. 16(b), the dispersion homogeneity of modified nanoparticles is observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2 nanocomposite membrane, which demonstrates high compatibility between PPBI polymer and PSV-SiO2 nanoparticles and the high dispersion abil-ity of PSV-SiO2 in PPBI matrix. Particle agglomeration is still not observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2-10%. The ionic linkages between PPBI and modified nanoparticles are contributed to their higher compatibility [32]. However, in nanocompos-ite membranes prepared from un-modified SiO2 nanoparticles, thedispersionofthenanoparticlesinpolymermatrixis not homogenous and probably aggregation has been formed (Fig. 16(c)).', '2582H. Namazi, H. Ahmadi / Journal of Power Sources 196 (2011) 2573–2583', 'Fig. 16. SEM micrograph of SiO2-PSV (a); TEM micrographs of PPBI/SiO2-PSV-10% (b); and PPBI/SiO2-10% (c).', '4. Conclusion', 'The nanocomposite PPBI-based membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified and un-modified TiO2 and SiO2nanoparticles. The thermal stability of the prepared nanocompos-', 'ite membranes was similar to PPBI membrane. The water uptake of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from TiO2/PSV and SiO2/PSV nanoparticles were higher than other nanocomposite membranes. The acid doping level and proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes in dry conditions obtained from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI nanoparticles were the highest in comparison to PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV. Formation of nanocomposites with modified and un-modified nanoparticles resulted the increas-ing of tensile strengths. The decreasing in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness was widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inor-ganic reinforcement. The high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicated that this membrane could be utilized as a proton exchange membrane for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. M.-G.
