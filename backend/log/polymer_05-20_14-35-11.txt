2025-05-20 14:35:44 - WARNING: ['Advanced elasticity and biodegradability of bio‑based  copolyester elastomer achieved by the crystallization  inhibition of isosorbide and flexibility of 1,6‑hexanediol', 'Lisheng Tang1  · Xiaoyan He1  · Ran Huang1', 'Received: 8 July 2024 / Revised: 13 August 2024 / Accepted: 24 September 2024 /   Published online: 26 October 2024  © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024 The stability to against hydrolysis while maintaining excellent elasticity is one of the most challenging problems in the development of biodegradable and environ-mental-friendly polyester elastomer. While monomers of longer chain can provide higher stability, the high crystallinity and rigidity impair their application in fabri-cating elastomer. This work reported a star-crosslinked poly(butanediol-hexanediol-isosorbitol-itaconate-sebacate) elastomer synthesized by esterification and thermal curing. With the crystallization inhibition effect of isosorbide as a large and rigid monomer, and the flexibility of 1,6-hexanediol, the rigid (butanediol-itaconate-seba-cate) copolyester system is successfully transformed from plastic to be elastomer with lower Tm and Tg, much higher elongation at break, and smaller tensile modulus, and the biodegradability is also improved. The strategy is demonstrated to be effi-cient and may serve as a potential technique in the future development of biodegrad-able elastomers.', 'Abstract', 'Keywords Biodegradable · Copolyester elastomer · PBHIIS · Isosorbide ·Crystallization inhibition', 'Introduction', 'Because of its special qualities, elastomers—a type of polymer with a low modulus and high elasticity—can rapidly return to their initial form following the removal of an external force. Because of these qualities, they are indispensable in both daily life and the economy [1–4]. Elastomers have been the subject of ongoing research and development to improve their strength, stability, aging resistance, and wear resistance in order to fulfill the ever-increasing performance requirements. How-ever, these advantages make it harder to dispose of the waste products made from conventional elastomers, which pollutes the environment over time [5, 6]. However, the majority of elastomers are derived from poorly sustainable non-renewable fos-sil fuels. The creation of novel elastomers that are not dependent on fossil fuels has become highly demanded in recent times due to the immense strain imposed by car-bon emissions. Bio-based elastomers are a great way to reduce carbon emissions and conserve resources in the elastomer sector since they may be made from natural plants directly or by synthesizing them from bio-based monomers produced from biomass resources.', 'Due to excellent biodegradability, aliphatic polyester became a prominent area of research for environmentally-friendly products. Linear polyesters, such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA), polyglycolide acid (PGA), polycaprolactone (PCL), and their copol-ymers, have been extensively studied in the field of plastic for many years. And their industrial production is seeing tremendous growth [7–9]. Polyesters having a three-dimensional network have gained increasing interest, motivated by these lin-ear polymers [10, 11]. Like vulcanized rubber, the cross-linked network is formed by the incorporation of "star" monomers to create multi-branched chains, enabling the material to rapidly regain its shape when subjected to substantial deformation. Poly (glycerol sebacate) (PGS), polyoctyl citrate (POC), and their copolymers are the primary biodegradable polyester elastomers that have undergone substantial research. The pioneering work is the synthesis of PGS, an in-situ cross-linked poly-ester elastomer with a three-dimensional network structure and exceptional robust-ness, conducted by Langer et al. successfully synthesized in 2002 [10, 12]. In 2011, Zhang et al. firstly introduced chemically crosslinked polyester elastomer [13]. Sub-sequently, many other bio-based elastomers have been created [14, 15].', 'It is well known that monomers of longer chain are easier to be synthesized to be polyester with higher stability, due to the lower density of ester linkage. For exam-ple, PCL and PBS are commercially mature materials, which employ 4- or 6- car-bon chain monomer [16], while polyglycolide acid (PGA) with 2-carbon monomer is unstable to hydrolysis and its commercial application is very limited [17]. How-ever, on the other hand, when the goal of our research is to obtain elastomers, the high crystallinity and rigidity due to longer chains becomes a disadvantage. Hereby a technical difficulty arises, how to construct biodegradable polyester with decent stability, cross-linkage network, and sufficient elasticity? That is, we probably need longer chain monomers, multi-functional “star” monomer, and some component to lower the crystallinity.', 'In chemically crosslinked polyester elastomers, the glass transition temperature can be decreased and crystallization can be hindered by employing multicompo-nent copolymerization and including monomers with side groups, which in turn improves the elasticity [18, 19]. Particular monomers with side group, large vol-ume and/or rigid segment can play a crucial role in crystallization inhibition. Gao et al. [20] designed and synthesized biobased poly(1,4-butanediol/2,3-butanediol/succinic acid/iconocarboxylic acid) co-polyesters (PBBSI) with varying 2,3-butan-ediol content. The co-polyesters underwent a transformation from stiff plastics to flexible elastomers due to the alteration in the amount of 2,3-butanediol. Hu et al. [21] synthesized the elastomer poly(2,3-butanediol-co-1,4-butanediol-co-succinate) (PBBS) by introducing 2,3-butanedioic acid into PBS, whose elasticity can be there-after improved with the crystallization inhibition effect.', 'Isosorbide, as a bulky, rigid, and food and environment safe monomer, can be introduced into the copolyester for tuning the crystallization and thermal properties. Zhang et al. [22] reported a bio-based shape memory polymer for biomedical appli-cations, which employs butanediol, isosorbide, sebacate, and itaconate to achieve a series of cross-linked copolyesters with excellent shape-recovery property. However, this series of (PBISI) copolyesters were not elastomers in the room temperature. On the other hand, our group has focused on the development of biodegradable elasto-mers using the dual-crosslinking property of itaconic acid [19, 23]. Thus, it is inher-ently captivating to us that this system shall also possess exceptional potential to function as an elastomer with significant industrial utility. The absence of longer chain monomers with greater flexibility may be the crucial factor for elasticity.', 'In this work, we select sebacic acid, itaconic acid, butanediol, and hexanediol to synthesize stable copolyesters, with sebacic acid as the long-chain monomer, ita-conic acid as the chemically crosslinking site, and two diols, butanediol and hex-anediol, to reduce the regularity of the copolyester. Isosorbide is then introduced to the copolyester to prepare the biodegradable elastomer as PBHIIS. Linear chains of this two copolyesters are synthesized as so-called pre-PBHI(I)S, and a final ther-mal curing with initiator benzoyl peroxide (BPO) vulcanized the linear chains to be structural network. The scheme of this work is illustrated in Fig. 1. The chemical structure, thermal and mechanical properties, and biodegradability of the final prod-ucts were characterized.', 'Experimental', 'Reagents and materials', 'Itaconic acid (analytic grade), hexanediol (analytic grade), and butanediol (analytic grade) are purchased from Shandong Yousuo Chemical Technology Co., Ltd, China; isosorbide (analytic grade), sebacic acid (analytic grade), and methylhydroquinone (analytic grade) are purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd.

Additionally, polymerization inhibitors comprising of 0.05 wt.% methylhydroqui-none and 0.02 wt.% hydroquinone are added. The resulting mixture is then placed in an oil bath and heated to a temperature of 140 ℃ to facilitate melting. Mechani-cal stirring and nitrogen environment for protection are employed during the entire esterification, while gradually raising the temperature. The reaction proceeds 1 h each time the temperature increases by 10  ℃ within the range of 140 ℃–180 ℃, for a total duration of 5 h. Subsequently, evacuate the system gradually raise the tem-perature while operating under lower pressure to facilitate the condensation reac-tion.

The prepolymer is subjected to repeated dissolution flocculation using a mixture of dichloromethane and metha-nol, which effectively eliminates impurity. Additionally, the majority of the solvent is eliminated through the process of rotary evaporation. Subsequently, the substance is introduced into a vacuum oven set at a temperature of 50 ℃, where it undergoes vacuum drying until the solvent is entirely eliminated.', 'The initiator BPO of 1 wt.% is added into the prepolymers and subject it to a cur-ing process at a temperature of 130 ℃ for a duration of 20 min. We prepared three sets of polyester elastomers with varying percentages of isosorbitol components. Table 1 displays the molar ratios of the three combinations of raw ingredients and the corresponding names of the polyester elastomers.', 'Characterization', 'Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis was carried out to determine the number-average molecular weight (Mn), weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and poly dispersity index (PDI) (PL-GPC220, Agilent Technologies, USA).

Gel permeation chromatography is employed to examine the molecular weight of the prepolymers. The Mn, Mw, and PDI of pre-PBHI(I)S are summarized in Table 2. Note that all the synthesis were undertaken with the identical device, procedure and operator, therefore the significant difference of molecular weight among PBHIS and PBHIIS mainly reflects the synthesizabil-ity of themselves. And it accords to our expectation that large and rigid isosorbide cause a harder chain formation with lower Mn and Mw, and PBHIIS4 exhibits a bit higher molecular weight than PBHIIS2, but these two are in comparable level and can be considered as trivial difference.', '@', '@', 'Figure 2a shows the FTIR spectra of PBHIIS2 before and after curing, due to the presence of unsaturated itaconic acid, the peak of C = C stretching vibration is located at 1650 \xadcm−1. Moreover, it can be seen from the figure that the intensity of the C = C peak located near 1650 \xadcm−1 of the cured PBHIIS2 decreases sig-nificantly, which indicates that the C = C on the molecular chain acts as a reaction site for cross-linking during the curing. Figure 2b is the FTIR spectrum of various PBHI(I)S. The presence of an absorption peak representing ester carbonyl C = O near 1730 \xadcm−1 proves the occurrence of esterification, which results in the gen-eration of ester bonds in the molecular structure. The peak of ether bond C–O–C near 1095 \xadcm−1 is enhanced significantly from PBHIS to PBHIIS4, which obvi-ously agrees with the factor that only isosorbide contains C–O–C bond among all the monomers.', 'The chemical structure of pre-PBHI(I)S is further characterized using 1H NMR spectroscopy. The 1H NMR spectrum of pre-PBHI(I)S is shown in Fig. 3. Typical signals can be observed at 6.36 ppm, 5.75 ppm and 3.38 ppm corresponding to the \xadHm, \xadHm’ and \xadHn of the itaconic acid-based units, which indicates that the pendent double bonds, –C(= \xadCH2)–, can still be well preserved after the esterification and condensation reaction due to the inhibitory effect of the polymerization inhibitor. The peaks at 5.22 ppm, 5.18 ppm, 4.86 ppm and 4.51 ppm correspond to the \xadHa, \xadHa’, \xadHb and \xadHc of isosorbitol units. The peaks between 4.00 ppm to 4.30 ppm repre-sent the \xadHj and \xadHo of –CH2– in butanediol and hexanediol units. The peaks can be detected at 2.32 ppm corresponding to the \xadHf of the sebacic acid units. According to the results of 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 3a–c), the molar ratios of each unit are calcu-lated and listed in Fig. 3d. It indicates that the isosorbide component of raw mate-rial is increased, and the isosorbide segment in the synthesized molecular chain also increases. This further supports the above FTIR characterizations.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Thermal and mechanical property', 'The DSC results of various PBHI(I)S are shown in Fig. 4. The thermal properties such as glass transition temperature (Tg, °C), melting temperature (Tm, °C), melt-ing enthalpy (ΔHm, J/g), crystallization temperature (Tc, °C), and crystallization enthalpy (ΔHc, J/g) are summarized in Table 3. The Tg of PBHIIS exhibits a pro-gressive rise as the isosorbide concentration rise. This can be attributed to the incor-poration of rigid molecule isosorbide, which hinders the movement of the polyes-ter molecular chain. Nevertheless, the Tc and ΔHc of PBHIIS gradually decrease as the content of isosorbitol increases. This suggests that the presence of the cyclic structure of isosorbitol hindered the orderly arrangement of polyester molecular chains, thereby inhibiting the crystallization ability of PBHIIS. The Tg, Tm, and Tc of PBHIIS4 are lower than room temperature (25 °C). Therefore, PBHIIS4 exhibits a high elasticity at room temperature.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The mechanical properties of polyester elastomers are evaluated by tensile test. The stress–strain curves of various PBHI(I)S at room temperature are shown in Fig. 5, and the mechanical properties are summarized in Table 4. The PBHIS exhibits a notable tensile strength of 12.5 MPa and undergoes an obvious “necking” phenomenon dur-ing the tensile process, characterized by irreversible plastic deformation. The PBHIIS2 exhibits a crystallization temperature below room temperature, while its melting tem-perature surpasses room temperature. The polyester possesses excellent ductility due to the presence of a number of random molecular chains. Additionally, a small portion of crystals act as physical crosslinking agents, enhancing the material’s strength and elon-gation at break. PBHIIS2 has both exceptional tensile strength and remarkable elonga-tion at the point of fracture due to the presence of physical cross-linking and reinforce-ment from a limited number of crystals. The PBHIIS4 is a fully disordered polymer that does not form crystals at normal room temperature, and its stress–strain curves exhibit almost linear behavior. In the case of PBHIIS, the strength and modulus of the material decline dramatically as the amount of isosorbide rises. However, the elonga-tion at break grows significantly, with PBHIIS4 even reaching an elongation at break of 846.8%. This suggests that both the composition of monomers with side groups and the specific type of monomers with side groups are important factors in determining the mechanical properties of copolyesters. In particular, isosorbide as monomer is an excel-lent option for regulating the mechanical properties of polyester elastomers.', '@', '@', 'Biodegradability', 'Figure 6 shows the histogram of the degradation weight loss of PBHI(I)S with degrada-tion time at 50 °C and in a compost bin. From the degradation weight loss histograms, it can be seen that all the polyester elastomers synthesized in this work have excellent biodegradable properties, and almost all of them can be completely degraded in about 1 month. The degradation rate is relatively slow in the pre-composting stage probably due to factors such as microbial attachment, and the degradation occurred more and more rapidly as the polyester elastomers are gradually exposed to more degradable sites with the passage of time. The addition of isosorbide increases the hydrophilic-ity of PBHIIS, making it more susceptible to water and microbial "attack" and easier to degrade. The hydrolysable ester bonds in copolyester elastomers are responsible for their excellent biodegradability, and the degradation rate of copolyester elastomers can be modulated to a certain extent by the amount and type of monomers used in the syn-thesis system.', '@', '@', 'Conclusion', 'Biodegradable polyester elastomers, PBHIIS, were successfully prepared from bio-based dibasic acids and diols by direct melt polycondensation and introduc-ing the large and rigid monomer isosorbide to reduce the chemical and geometri-cal regularity of the molecular chain.', 'By adjusting the molar ratios of the isosorbide monomer, it was found that, with the increase in the amount of the side group-containing monomers, the crys-tallization of the polyesters gradually weakened, the deformation of the poly-esters in the tensile process shifted from mainly plastic to elastic deformation, and there was a tendency to accelerate the rate of the polyester’s biodegradation. Comparing to PBHIS and PBHIIS2, the PBHIIS4 has a Tm (24.53 °C) close to room temperature, and a significant elongation at break of 846.8%, which is more than 11 times of the PBHIS. These findings certified that the isosorbide is a suc-cessful component in developing polyester elastomers and we hope it may serve as potential tool in the future research.', 'Acknowledgements The National Key Research and Development Program China (2022YFC2009500), Guangdong Provincial Science and Technology Program (2023A0505050146), the Medical Engineering Fund of Fudan University (yg2022-008).', 'Author contributions R.H. supervised and coordinated project; R.H. and L.T. designed research; L.T. performed research; L.T., and X.H. analyzed data; R.H., X.H. and L.T. acquired funding and resource; and R.H. and L.T. wrote paper.', 'Data availability The main data generated or analyzed to support the conclusion during this study are included in this published article.

The PU prepolymer is a reaction product of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and a pentamethylene diisocyanate trimer (PDI-t). Furfuryl amine was attached to the terminal isocyanic groups of PU, resulting in furfuryl amine polyurethane (PU-FA). PU-FA was cross-linked via dynamic bonds between the furan groups and BMI, generating reversible bonds with the material. This study explored reversible polymer networks under various thermal conditions, including different reaction parameters, prepolymer ratios, and healing temperatures, to evaluate the healing capabilities of these polymers. The results demonstrated that PU-DA exhibits thermal reversibility, as evidenced by the appearance of an endothermic peak in the DSC analysis, indicating bond cleavage via the retro-Diels–Alder (r-DA) reaction. This endothermic peak re-emerged after cooling at 70 °C for 24 h, further confirming the reversibility of the reac-tion. Additionally, crack healing in the PU-DA film was facilitated by the synergistic effects of the thermally reversible Diels–Alder reaction and the thermal mobility of molecular chains. The self-healing performance evaluation revealed that PU-DA samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 exhibited a reduction in tensile strength after healing compared to the original PU-DA specimens before heat treatment. Conversely, samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 demonstrated a healing efficiency exceeding 100%, attributed to the enhanced cross-link density, which contributed to a more robust network structure.', '@', '@', "In this study, self-healing Diels-Alder polyurethane (PU-DA) was successfully synthesized using PDI trimer. The findings confirmed that the material's healing mechanism is activated by the reversible interaction between furan and maleimide groups within PU-DA, enabling it to autonomously repair structural damage", 'Keywords Polyurethane · Prepolymer · Self-healing · Pentamethylene diisocyanate trimer · Diels–Alder', '1 Introduction', 'Polyurethane has profoundly improved the quality of modern life through its diverse applications across multiple industries. It is integral in enhancing the performance and functionality of products in sectors, such as coatings, automotive, textiles, synthetic leather, electronics, construction materials, aerospace, and medicine. This versatile material not only improves the durability and efficiency of these products but also contributes to advances in technology and quality of life [1–4]. In practical applications, polyurethane is susceptible to the development of small cracks due to factors, such as heat, mechanical stress, and exposure to chemicals. These microcracks can significantly reduce the service life of polyurethane and are often challenging to detect visually [5]. Inspired by the self-repair mechanisms observed in nature, scientists have engineered polymers with inherent self-healing capabilities within certain limits. Self-healing strategies can be broadly categorized as extrinsic or intrinsic [6]. Extrinsic self-healing involves the incorporation of a healing agent within a polymer matrix; however, this method lacks reusability, because the healing agent is depleted upon each use. With this method, no external stimuli are needed for healing to occur. Conversely, the intrinsic self-healing system enables repetitive healing across multiple cycles of damage, although most methods in this system require external stimuli to initiate the healing process. As a result, intrinsic self-healing materials have attracted increasing attention in recent years [7].', 'Intrinsic self-healing materials normally contain dynamic bonds or interactions that can be broken and reformed to heal the material. These bonds can be covalent or nonco-valent in nature. Covalent bonds are often used because of their high strength of the bonds. Some examples of these bonds are Diels–Alder, disulfide, radical interactions, and cyclic compounds [8, 9]. Numerous studies have been conducted to develop self-healing polyurethanes with Diels–Alder chemistry. Self-healing polyurethanes (SH-PU) via the Diels–Alder method mostly comprise isocyanic polyurethane (to differ from nonisocyanic polyurethane) and commonly employ two main approaches. The first method involves the incorporation of furan terminals into the PU prepolymer, which are subsequently crosslinked with bis-maleimide (BMI). The second method involves the prepa-ration of a PU prepolymer containing maleimide pendant groups, which consequently react with difunctional furan compounds to produce SH-PU [5].', 'For isocyanates, researchers prefer the use of aliphatic isocyanate trimers for polyurethane coatings, because they offer lower toxicity, enhanced thermal stability, superior mechanical properties, and increased weather resistance [10]. The use of isocyanate trimers in the synthesis of self-healing polyurethane via the Diels–Alder system is wide-spread among researchers, with isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) trimers being the most commonly used [11–13]. IPDI is a cycloaliphatic isocyanate with one ring structure, whereas the IPDI trimer comprises a structure with four rings. These rings make the obtained polyurethane more rigid than when the diisocyanate is fully aliphatic, while more flexible materials are needed. To fill this gap, the entirely aliphatic hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and its trimers (HDI-t) were used. Researchers have used HDI-t to fabricate self-healing polymers [14–22]. To answer the demand for greener materials, the bio-based pentamethyl-ene diisocyanate and its trimer are already available in the market. Some researchers have employed pentamethylene diisocyanate trimers (PDI-t) in the synthesis of functional polyurethanes [23–25]. Most studies on self-healing polyu-rethanes primarily use the conventional isocyanates derived from fossil resources, such as 1,6-diisocyanatohexane (HDI), which does not align with the growing demand for more environmentally sustainable and eco-friendly materials [26, 27]. Despite its promising potential to improve cross-linking density and mechanical properties, the use of PDI-trimer derived from bio-based sources as an isocyanate has not been widely explored. In this study, we investigated the self-healing synthesis of PDI-trimer as an isocyanate through the Diels–Alder reaction method, focusing on the impact of the NCO/OH ratio on its thermal behavior, healing efficiency, and mechanical performance. A series of PU prepolymer formulations were synthesized from polyethylene glycol (PEG) and PDI-trimer (PDI-t) at different reaction times, temperatures, and NCO/OH ratios. These prepolymers were then reacted with furfuryl amine (FA) to yield PU-FA. Addi-tionally, self-healing polyurethane (SH-PU) was synthesized by cross-linking PU-FA with bismaleimide (BMI) via the Diels–Alder reaction. These experiments were performed to understand how the different synthesis conditions affect the mechanical properties and healing behavior of the end polymer products. The knowledge is expected to contribute to the development of green polyurethane, particularly for coating application.', '2 \x07Experimental', '2.1 \x07Materials', "Furfurylamine (99%, FA), 1,1'-(methylenedi-4,1-phenylene) bismaleimide (BMI), polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG), and dibutyltin dilaurate (95%, DBTDL) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Before polymerization, polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG) with a molecular weight of 4000 g/mol was dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 2 h. The isocyanate trimer Desmodur® eco N7300 (pentamethylene diisocy-anate/PDI-t), with an NCO content of 21.9% and an equiva-lent weight of 195, was sourced directly from PT Covestro Indonesia without further purification. Dimethylformamide (DMF), which was used as the solvent in the procedure, was purchased from Merck. Polyurethane with a furan terminal (PU-FA) and self-healing polyurethane (PU-DA) were syn-thesized as described in the previous studies [11, 28]. The synthesis details are described in the supporting information. FTIR spectroscopy spectra were acquired using a Brucker Tensor 27 spectrometer via the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) method, which uses 64 scans with a resolution of 4 \xadcm − 1 in transmittance mode in the wavenumber range of 4000–500 \xadcm − 1. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis was conducted using a Bruker Avance Neo 700 MHz NMR spectrophotometer with DMSO-d6 and \xadCDCl3 as solvents. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of PU-furan and PU-DA was performed using a Linseis STA instrument (STA PT1600) under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 °C min1 from 30 to 900 °C. The thermal behavior of PU-DA was assessed via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) using a Perkin Elmer DSC 8000 instru-ment in the temperature range of 0–190 °C. The heating and cooling rates were 20 °C/min, and all experiments were conducted under a protective nitrogen atmosphere. The melting temperature \xad(Tm) and entropy of fusion (ΔHm) data were collected during the second heating run. The density of the crosslinked polyurethanes (PUs) was determined using a pycnometer with distilled water as the immersion liquid. To assess the crosslink density of the samples, the degree of swelling, and gel content, the samples were measured. Samples 10 × 10x0.3 mm in size were immersed in 10 mL of toluene at room temperature in sealed containers for 24 h. Afterward, the film was washed with toluene and weighed to determine its mass \xad(ms). The films were subsequently sub-jected to drying at 35 °C initially under atmospheric pressure and then under vacuum, after which the weight of the dried film \xad(md) was recorded. The degree of swelling (Q) and gel content (G) were calculated using Eqs. (1) and (2) [29, 30]", '2.2 \x07Characterization', 'Q = 1 + 휌1휌2( msmd −1).', 'Furthermore', 'G(%) = mdmiso × 100.', 'Here, ρ1 and ρ2 represent the densities of the solvent (tol-uene, ρ: 0.8669 g/cm3) and the PU polymer, respectively. The variable md corresponds to the post-extraction weight of the dried sample post-extraction, whereas \xadmiso denotes the isolated weight of the sample before the extraction process.', 'The self-healing capability of PU-DA was qualitatively assessed using a Hirox KH-7700 digital microscope to observe the mending process of cracks induced by blades on the sample surfaces. The sheet samples were intentionally scratched at a depth of 0.5 mm and then subjected to five dif-ferent heating treatments to observe their self-healing ability. The treatments involved heating at temperatures of 100 °C, 110 °C, 120 °C, and 130 °C for 10 min, heating at 130 °C for 2 h, and cooling at 70 °C for 24 h. A quantitative study was conducted to evaluate the recovery of tensile strength following the self-healing process, utilizing a universal test-ing machine (Shimadzu AG–X Plus 50 kN). PU-DA samples were prepared as specimens according to ASTM D638 type 4, which were scratched in the center with a knife blade measuring 1 cm in length and 1 mm in depth. The self-healing process was then performed by heating the samples at 130 °C for 2 h, followed by a 24-h period at 70 °C. The self-healing efficiency was calculated based on the recovery of tensile strength using Eq. (3)', 'Healing Efficiency (% ) = Tensile strength healedTensile strength original × 100%. The synthesis pathway of PU-DA is depicted in Fig. 1, and the reaction conditions are explained in Table 1. Initially, PEG was reacted with an excess PDI-trimer to obtain a prepolymer with isocyanates as the terminal functional groups. Because of the different reaction conditions applied during this step, the prepolymers were assumed to possess different properties, as observed during the reaction. The prepolymer was subsequently reacted with furfuryl amine (FA), resulting in the formation of furan-terminated polyurethane (PU-FA). The final product polyurethane Diels–Alder (PU-DA) was obtained through the Diels–Alder reaction between PU-FA and bismaleimide (BMI) at 80 °C, followed by solvent evaporation at 60 °C under vacuum. Structural analysis of polyethylene glycol (PEG), the PDI-trimer, PU-FA, and PU-DA was performed using 1H-NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 2).', '3 \x07Results and discussion', '3.1 \x07Synthesis of polyurethane Diels–Alder (PU‑DA)', 'The NMR spectrum of PU-FA (Fig. 2c) reveals the suc-cessful synthesis of the PU prepolymer and the subsequent incorporation of the furan group. The PU prepolymer struc-ture is revealed by the emergence of a carbamate bond (NH‒COO) peak at 3.41 ppm (c). The furan group attached to the prepolymer is distinguished by the presence of distinct furan ring peaks at 6.18 ppm (m), 6.37 ppm (n), and 7.55 ppm (o). Additionally, an amide group, which indicates the urethane or urea proton NH, was observed at 5.90 ppm (d, k). Further-more, the product of the PU-FA and BMI reactions (Fig. 2d), a Diels–Alder adduct, is characterized by notable proton shifts at 3.07 ppm (r), 5.18 ppm (q), and 6.42–6.59 ppm (p). The aromatic structure of BMI is indicated by peaks in the range of 7.26–7.35 ppm (s, t). Additionally, the characteris-tic methylene peak originating from BMI was identified at 3.9 ppm (u).', '@', '@', "The formation of the polyurethane prepolymer from the reaction between polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the pentamethylene diisocyanate (PDI) trimer was confirmed through FTIR spectroscopy, as depicted in Fig. 3 and S1. The FTIR spectrum reveals a characteristic absorption peak at 2270 cm⁻1, which corresponds to the stretching vibration of the isocyanate (NCO) group. This distinct peak serves as a definitive indicator of the presence of the polyurethane prepolymer and remains detectable throughout the progression of the reaction, providing consistent evidence of the NCO group's role in the synthesis process. The ATR-FTIR spectra shown in Fig. 3 for the PU prepolymer, PU-FA, and PU-DA support the findings of the 1H NMR analysis. The lack of a peak at 2270 cm⁻1 in PU-FA confirms that the isocyanate group has reacted, indicating no residual isocyanate group remains. In contrast, the emergence of peaks at 1012, 736, and 811 \xadcm−1 distinctly confirms the incorporation of a furan ring in PU–FA [31, 32]. Compared with PU-FA, PU-DA has an obvious shoulder peak at 1710 \xadcm−1, which is characteristic of the DA adduct (–C = O band of imide) [33]. Simultaneously, the intensity decreases at 1012, 811, and 736 \xadcm−1, stemming from the consumption of the furan ring by the BMI molecule (Fig. 3b). This reduction clearly indicates the success of the PU–FA reaction with BMI through the Diels–Alder reaction.", '@', '@ DSC analyses of both the pristine PEG and PU-DA formulations were carried out over a temperature range of 0 °C to 190 °C. Figure 4a shows the DSC curve of pristine PEG, which shows distinct melting and crystallization peaks at 61.1 °C and 21.5 °C, respectively. In contrast, Fig. 4b shows that the endothermic peak (melting temperature) of PU-DA is generally lower than that of pristine PEG (61.1 °C). This difference results from the hindrance of multiple PEG crystalline segments as they interact during the formation of Diels–Alder cross-links, restricting their ability to organize into a well-defined crystalline structure. [34]. The cooling DSC curve (Fig. 4c) shows the reformation of PEG characterized by an exothermic peak. Owing to the inhibition of chain mobility by Diels–Alder crosslinks, PU-DA formulations tend to display higher crystallization temperatures than pristine PEG, indicating that recrystallization occurred earlier during cooling. Figure 4d shows the first and second heating–cooling cycles in the DSC thermogram of PU-DA formula 6. In the first heating cycle (black line), the thermogram of PU shows a modest endothermic peak between 110 and 150 °C, indicating the occurrence of a retro-DA reaction (release of furan and maleimide group bonds) [35]. Moreover, in the cooling curve (red line), a small exothermic peak at approximately 72 °C (as clearly shown in the inset photograph) suggests', '3.2 \x07Thermal characteristics and reversibility of Diels–Alder (DA) bonds the reformation of DA adduct bonds, which are possibly obscured by PEG recrystallization. Meanwhile, during the second heating cycle (blue line), the absence of the endothermic peak can be attributed to the insufficient interval between the two cycles, which prevented the complete reconstruction of the DA bonds. This inadequacy led to the peak not being discernible by DSC during the second heating cycle [36, 37].', 'In Table 2, the melting enthalpies of the eight polyu-rethane Diels–Alder (PU-DA) formulations ranged from 25.5 to 134.5 J/g, while the crystallization enthalpies (ΔHc) ranged from 26.2 to 136.8 J/g. Compared to pristine PEG (ΔHm = 158.3 J/g, ΔHc = 137.0 J/g), the PU-DA formulation exhibits a lower melting and crystallization enthalpy, sug-gesting that the crystallization and melting of PEG segments are hindered. This reduction is attributed to the restricted molecular mobility imposed by Diels–Alder cross-linking, which limits the ability of PEG chains to organize into a well-defined crystalline structure [38]. The synthesis of PU-DA involved NCO/OH ratios of 1.5 and 3. Notably, the data in Table 2 indicate that an NCO/OH ratio of 3 resulted in lower melting and crystallization enthalpies than an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5. This difference may stem from the higher NCO/OH ratio, which intensifies the disruption of PEG crystalline segments as a result of increased Diels–Alder cross-link formation. Consequently, the restricted molecular mobility leads to lower melting and crystallization enthalp-ies compared to the sample with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5. This is further evidenced by the NCO/OH ratio of 3, which corresponds to a higher gel content value compared to the ratio of 1.5.', 'One advantage of intrinsic self-healing materials lies in the repeatability of their healing process, which stems from the reversibility of dynamic bonds. The thermal reversibility of Diels–Alder bonds further elucidate this mechanism. The thermal treatment of the PU-DA samples (Fig. 5a) and subsequent DSC measurements with consistent parameters revealed significant insights. In Fig. 5b, the observed peak (38–60 °C) indicates the melting of PEG crystals within the Diels–Alder polyurethane matrix. The thermograms also revealed modest endothermic peaks, indicating the breakage of DA adducts from the original polymer synthesis', '@', '@ process (DA1) at 120 °C (sample F5-PUDA) and 140 °C (F6-PUDA). After heat treatment and cooling at 70 °C, DSC observations (Fig. 5c and Table S2) revealed decreased melting and crystallization enthalpies of PEG in DA2 compared with those in DA1, which was attributed to the presence of DA2 bonds hindering the mobility of the PEG crystalline segments [39]. The decrease in enthalpies indicates Diels–Alder bond reconstruction during heating at 70 °C for 24 h. This phenomenon confirmed the reproducible thermal reversibility of the synthesized PU-DA samples.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Tm and \xadTc represent the melting/crystallization temperature, respectively; ΔHm and ΔHc represent the melt-ing/crystallization enthalpy, respectively, and the density (ρ), degree of swelling (Q), and gel content (G) were measured experimentally', '@', '@', 'Figure 6 shows the TGA and DTG curves of the Diels–Alder polyurethane sample under consistent heating conditions. The DTG curve reveals two distinct stages of thermal decomposition, marked by a minor peak in the initial stage and a substantial mass loss in the subsequent stage. The observed minor peak at approximately 160 °C likely arises from the evaporation of residual DMF within the material [40]. While the TGA curves of the PU-DA series are similar, the polyurethane samples F2 and F8 exhibit lower thermal stability, which can be related to their lower gel contents. In this sample, the rapid formation of the PU prepolymer restricts the extent to which furan groups can react with the prepolymer. Consequently, furan groups face challenges in integrating into the maleimide structure, leading to decreased formation of Diels–Alder crosslinks.', '3.3 \x07Healing ability', 'The self-healing behaviors of the eight PU-DA samples were comprehensively assessed using qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The qualitative evaluation involved a scratch test to visually assess the material’s healing capacity, whereas quantitative analysis was performed by determining the percentage of healing efficiency via hardness measurements. To qualitatively explore the healing process, the PU-DA film samples were subjected to five distinct heating treatments. The four treatments included heating the samples at temperatures ranging from 100 to 130 °C for 10 min each, followed by cooling to ambient temperature. The fifth treatment consisted of heating the sample at 130 °C for 2 h to promote the retro-Diels–Alder reaction, followed by heating at 70 °C for 24 h to facilitate the Diels–Alder reaction. The outcomes were evaluated using a digital microscope set at 100 × magnification. The results of the four thermal treatments are shown in Figure S2-S3, and the results of the fifth thermal treatment are shown in Fig. 8.', '@', '@', 'Polyurethane chains consist of soft segments derived from polyols and hard segments derived from isocyanates, with thermal energy influencing the mobility of these segments. Generally, soft segments exhibit greater mobility than hard segments upon heating, while hard segments restrict the thermal motion of molecular chains. Consequently, the self-healing capability of PU-DA is significantly influenced by the ratio of soft-to-hard segments, which can be controlled by adjusting the NCO/OH molar ratio. Observations from optical microscopy (Fig. 7) of the healing test conducted at 100 °C indicate that samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 (formulas F1–F4) exhibit faster scratch recovery compared to those with a ratio of 3 (formulas F5–F8). Similar trends were observed at 110, 120, and 130 °C (Figure S2.I-II and S3.III-IV), where samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 demonstrated superior healing efficiency. This phenomenon can be attributed to the higher proportion of soft segments in the 1.5 ratio, which enhances the mobility of the PU chains, allowing PU-FA and BMI to reflow and fill cracks after heat treatment. Conversely, samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 contain fewer soft segments, restricting polymer chain mobility and impeding the healing process [41].', '@', '@', '@', '@', "The thermally induced self-healing property of PU-DA is linked to the dissociation and reformation of Diels–Alder (DA) bonds. The images below illustrate the response of the PU-DA samples to various temperature treatments, confirm-ing the reconstruction of the DA bonds in the crosslinked network under thermal stimulation. PU-DA film samples etched at the same position were heated at temperatures ranging from 100 to 130 °C for 10 min each. At 100 °C, most scratches remained visible, although slight healing at the scratch base was observed (Figure S2.I). At 110 °C, some PU-DA samples exhibited increased healing, although small scars from incomplete healing were still present (Fig-ure S2.II). Treatments at 120 °C and 130 °C (Figures S3. III-IV) resulted in significantly better healing responses than those at lower temperatures, with tightly closed cracks indi-cating a reversible reaction between the furan and maleimide groups on the PU-DA surface [34]. Wool and O'Connor’s theory posits that the polymer chain diffusion rate is cru-cial in controlling the healing speed during the crack heal-ing process [42]. The temperature significantly affected the diffusion rate. When heated, the scratched surface deforms back to its original position, bringing the separated surfaces into contact. Simultaneously, the retro-DA reaction acceler-ates chain interdiffusion between the crack surfaces after clo-sure, leading to successful healing [43]. The scratches on the PU-PA film disappeared completely after heating to 130 °C for 2 h (Figure S3). This heating caused fluidization, which facilitated self-healing of the damaged area. Upon cooling to 70 °C, rebonding occurred, leading to the reconstruction of the Diels–Alder cross-linked network [44].", 'The quantitative evaluation of self-healing was conducted by measuring the recovery of tensile strength using a univer-sal testing machine (Shimadzu AG–X Plus 50kN). PU-DA samples were prepared by casting polymer films from a DMF solution, with dimensions of 17 cm in length, 16 cm in width, and a thickness ranging from 0.5 to 1 mm. The films were then subjected to solvent evaporation at 65 °C for 24 h. Specimens were prepared by punching the films according to the ASTM D638 type 4 standard, followed by introducing a scratch measuring 1 cm in length and 1 mm in depth at the center using a knife blade. The self-healing process was performed by heating the specimens at 130 °C for 2 h, and then maintaining them at 70 °C for 24 h. The healing efficiency was quantified based on the recovery of tensile strength, calculated using Eq. (3).', 'In this study, the self-healing behavior of PU-DA samples was evaluated using formulations with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 for the F5-F8 samples and 1.5 for the F1-F4 samples. Figure 8b presents the representative stress–strain curves of the original and healed PU-DA samples after being scratched. The corresponding values of tensile strength, elongation at break, and elastic modulus are shown in Fig. 8c–8e. The results from the tensile strength and elongation at break tests (Fig. 8c and 8d) indicate a distinct trend in healing performance, samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 exhibited a reduction in tensile strength and elongation at break after healing, whereas those with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 showed an increase in both properties following the healing process. Furthermore, the elastic modulus (Fig. 8e) increased in all PU-DA samples, regardless of the NCO/OH ratio. The evaluation of self-healing performance in PU-DA samples revealed distinct differences in mechanical properties depending on the NCO/OH ratio used during synthesis. Specifically, PU-DA formulations with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 (Formulas F1–F5) exhibited a noticeable decline in tensile strength after the healing process when compared to PU-DA specimens that had not undergone thermal treatment. This reduction suggests that a lower cross-linking density may have limited the material’s ability to recover its original mechanical integrity. Conversely, PU-DA samples synthesized with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 (Formulas F5–F8) displayed a significant enhancement in healing efficiency, surpassing 100%. This remarkable self-healing capability is primarily attributed to the presence of a greater number of cross-links within the polymer network, which is directly correlated with the observed increase in gel content. The higher cross-link density not only facilitated more effective reformation of the molecular structure after damage but also contributed to improved tensile strength, exceeding that of the original PU-DA sample before healing. These findings highlight the critical role of cross-linking density in optimizing self-healing properties and mechanical robustness in thermally reversible polyurethane systems.', "The self-healing performance of PU-DA is governed by the synergistic effects of thermally induced polyurethane chain mobility and the thermo-reversible Diels–Alder (DA) reaction. Consequently, the self-healing capability of PU-DA is strongly influenced by the ratio of soft-to-hard segments, which can be controlled through the NCO/OH molar ratio. At an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5, the tensile strength after healing decreases compared to the original PU-DA sample (see Table 3). In contrast, when compared to a ratio of 3, both the pre- and post-healing tensile strength values are lower. This phenomenon can be attributed to the lower crosslink density, as indicated by the gel content, in PU-DA samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 compared to those with a ratio of 3 (see Fig. 9f and Table S3). The reduced crosslink density in the 1.5 ratio results in lower tensile strength relative to the 3.0 ratio. At a higher hard-segment content (i.e., an NCO/OH ratio of 3), the formation of additional crosslinks between hard segments enhances structural integrity, requiring more energy to disrupt the network [45]. Self-healing efficiency is influenced by the polymer chain's ability to diffuse across the crack area and the availability of broken cross-links for reformation. These two factors exhibit an inverse relationship: as the cross-link density increases, chain diffusion is hindered, leading to a higher number of broken cross-links. At lower cross-linking levels, mechanical strength decreases. This phenomenon explains why the self-healing efficiency of the PU-DA sample with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 is lower compared to the ratio of 3, where the gel content is higher. Additionally, self-healing values exceeding 100%, which are attributed to the presence of cross-links reflected in the gel content, result in higher tensile strength than the original PU-DA sample [46, 47].", '4 \x07Conclusions', 'The behavior of the isocyanate trimer (PDI-trimer) in the synthesis of self-healing polyurethane (PU-DA) via the Diels–Alder (DA) reaction was investigated through the reaction between the furan-terminated prepolymer and bismaleimide. Digital microscopy and DSC observations revealed that cracks with a depth of 0.5 mm in the PU-DA film could be repaired after heat treatment at 120–130 °C for 10 min, achieving complete healing at 130 °C for 10 min, followed by cooling at 70 °C for 24 h. The tightly closed cracks indicate a reversible reaction between the furan and maleimide groups on the surface of the PU-DA sample. Additionally, the DSC results revealed an endothermic peak in the PU-DA material (DA1), indicating the breakage of the Diels–Alder bond (r-DA). After cooling at 70 °C for 24 h, the endothermic peak remained visible (DA2), demonstrating the thermal reversibility of the synthesized PU-DA samples, which allows for repeated healing due to the reversibility of the Diels–Alder bond.', '@', '@', 'a A self-healing efficiency of 100% is attained when a PU-DA sample that undergoes a healing process—comprising heat treatment at 130 °C for 2 h followed by additional heating at 70 °C for 24 h—restores its tensile strength to the same level as the original, unhealed sample that has not undergone any thermal treatment. It is important to note that PU-DA1 refers to the pristine PU-DA sample, while PU-DA2 represents the healed PU-DA specimen', '@', '@', 'The NCO/OH ratio significantly influences the forma-tion of the furan‒maleimide crosslink bond structure. At a ratio of 3, the formation of PEG crystals is smaller than that at a ratio of 1.5, indicating that a higher ratio leads to more crosslink bonds and a decrease in the melting enthalpy value in DSC measurements. The healing efficiency of PU-DA samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 (Formulas F1-F5) showed a reduction in tensile strength compared to the unheated PU-DA specimens. In contrast, PU-DA sam-ples with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 (Formulas F5-F8) dem-onstrated enhanced healing efficiency, exceeding 100%, which can be attributed to the higher density of cross-links. This increased cross-linking, as reflected in the gel content, resulted in greater tensile strength than the original PU-DA sample.

Therefore, safe and efficient gene delivery vectors are needed to facilitate gene therapy’s clinical implemen-tation further. Although viral vectors exhibit high transfection efficiency, their safety issues limit their furtherapplication. Despite their promising clinical performance, lipid nanoparticles suffer from poor stability and difficult storage. Polymer cationic vectors (PCVs) with low cost, low immunogenicity, and tunability haveattracted the attention of scientists. This article reviews the main strategies to improve the gene transfectionefficiency of polymeric delivery systems in recent years and their applications in certain diseases. However, there are still challenges in gene delivery with polymer vectors. Hence, the paper concludes with anoutlook on the future development of PCVs, which will hopefully help in the design of PCVs.', '1.Introduction', 'Gene therapy has shown unlimited potential for treating both hereditary and acquired diseases.1 According to Emergency Research’s market research, internationally relevant gene therapy companies are expected to generate approximately $6.6 billion in revenue by 2027.2 The treatment of relevant dis-eases is achieved by introducing exogenous nucleic acids into target cells, inducing gene silencing (inhibition of pathological protein production),3 gene expression (promotion of thera-peutic protein expression),4 and gene editing (modification of dysfunctional genes).5 However, multiple intra- and extracellu-lar barriers must be overcome for effective gene transfection.6DNA and RNA are a group of large negatively charged biologi-cal macromolecules that are rapidly cleared by macrophages and the reticuloendothelial system, have a short half-life in the organism, are easily degraded by endonucleases, and have strong electrostatic repulsive effects with the cellular mem-brane, and are refractory to escape from endosomes as well as toenterthenucleus.7–10Therefore,exploitingsafeand efficient gene delivery vectors is one of the most potent strat- egies to overcome multiple biological barriers during gene delivery.', 'Delivery vectors are mainly divided into two categories: viral vectors and non-viral vectors. Approximately 70% of clinical gene therapy trials use viral vectors, such as retroviruses, lenti-viruses, and adenoviruses.11 Due to their specific infectious properties, viral vectors typically exhibit excellent transfection efficiency in vivo. However, viral vectors pose clinical safety pro-blems, such as their inherent high immunogenicity and the risk of integrating their own sequences into the host genome. Additionally, viral vectors have certain limitations for thera-peutic use, such as low gene loading, delivery of only small-sized genes, complex preparation processes, and the inability to repeat administration.11 By contrast, non-viral vectors, especially lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and cationic polymers, have been favored by scientists due to their advantages, such as high gene loading efficiency, excellent safety profile, and simplicity of preparation. The low toxicity, safety, and transla-tional capacity of LNPs vectors have made it possible to use in clinical applications, such as the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine.12Nevertheless, LNPs still suffer from poor stability, difficulty in storage,13 and liver tropism.14 Polymer-based gene delivery systems present less clinical performance than lipids, but they have lower enzymatic degradability, higher stability, lower cost, andmoreaccessiblephysicalpropertiestomanipulate. Moreover, polymer vectors allow the assembly of different nanostructures under aqueous conditions, with lyophilization, long-termstoragecapabilities,anduniquepharmacoki-netics.15 Polymer nanoparticles have different chemical and physical properties and can be synthesized, modified, and tai-lored according to different applications. However, polymer vectors still remain challenging in gene delivery.', 'Cationic groups in polymeric cationic vectors (PCVs) can form stable nanocomplexes with phosphate groups in nucleic acidsthroughelectrostatic/hydrophobicinteractions,with sizes ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers.1 Adequate considerations are necessary in designing efficient PCVs. The first is the influence of the PCVs’ surface charge. Upon an increaseinpositive charge density,PCVs enhances the capacity to compress nucleic acids but increases the difficulty of releasing nucleic acids inside the cell.16 Higher positive charge densities also lead to significant cytotoxicity and adsorption of serum proteins, causing the aggregation of nanoparticlestobeclearedbythereticuloendothelial system.17,18 In contrast, an overly low positive charge density is detrimental to cellular uptake of the nanocomplexes, leading to a reduced gene transfection efficiency. Therefore, exploring the optimal positive charge density is crucial for efficient gene delivery. Secondly, the effect of polymer topology, hydrophobi-city of chain segments, and size and shape of the nanocom-plexes should be considered. The density and molecular weight of the hydrophilic chain segments have a remarkable effect on the stability of the nanoparticles, and excessive hydrophilicity is unfavorable for efficient DNA cohesion and stabilization.1 Nanoparticles smaller than 50 nm are normally cleared rapidly by the kidneys, whereas nanoparticles larger than 300 nm might elicit an immune response in vivo.19 In addition, the effects of endosomes/lysosomes need to be con-sidered. The acidic environment within endosomes/lysosomes, along with various nucleic acid endonucleases, results in the degradation of nanocomplexes and naked nucleic acids.20 For endosomal/lysosomal escape, scientists have proposed two mainpathways,“protonspongeeffect”and“membrane fusion”.21 In the case of DNA, how to enter the nucleus more efficiently for transcription needs to be considered.22 Although RNA functions in the cytoplasm, it is essential to consider how to release it quickly and efficiently. Regarding the in vivo organ tropic properties of PCVs, how to make the nanocomplexes more productive in target cells or organs dramatically affects the final therapeutic effectiveness. In recent years, scientists have developed a wide range of PCVs with excellent perform-ance through unremitting efforts. This review is mainly to outline the main strategies to improve the gene transfection efficiency of PCVs recently and their applications in certain diseases, then conclude with an outlook on the future develop-ment of PCVs, which will hopefully shed some light on the development of this field (Fig. 1).', '2.Strategies to improve gene transfection efficiency', 'Numerous cationic polymers have been employed in the exploitation of gene delivery vectors, such as dextran, chitosan, polylysine(PLL),polyarginine(PLR),polyamide-amine (PAMAM) dendrimers, polyethyleneimine (PEI) poly (β-amino esters) (PBAEs), and others. However, some problems still con-strain the efficiency of gene transfection, such as stability, cyto-toxicity, targeting, cellular uptake, and endosomal escape. Therefore, effective strategies to address these challenges are required to be developed, and this section summarizes some feasible strategies, including modulation of surface charge, alteration of topological structure, modification of polymers, introduction of stimulus-responsive units, incorporation of machine learning, utilization of mechanistic perturbations, assessment of in vivo distribution, probing the effect of distri-bution of different molecular weight fractions, and combined use of multiple means.', '2.1Modulation of surface charge', 'High doses of cationic carriers disrupt cell membranes23 and may induce immunogenicity and inflammation,24,25 resulting in severe cytotoxicity. Shielding the charge of cationic poly-mers with hydrophilic or anionic polymers is an effective means of reducing cytotoxicity.26 By adjusting the ratio between anionic and cationic polymers, cytotoxic effects can be mitigated with little loss of transfection efficiency.27', 'The surface charge can also be decreased by removing the cationic portion of the polymer. Huang et al. designed and synthesized a cationic triblock copolymer, cRGD – PEG – PAsp (MEA) PAsp (CvN-DETA), which consists of a cRGD-capped poly(ethylene glycol) block (cRGD-PEG), a poly(aspartic acid) block with a sulfhydryl side group [PAsp(MEA)]and a poly (aspartic acid) block with a sulfhydryl side group grafted with the cationic divinylenetriamine (DETA) through a pH-sensitive imine bond [PAsp(CvN-DETA)] (Fig. 2a).28 After complexing siRNA with the above copolymers, the sulfhydryl groups of the intermediate layer were oxidized to disulfide bonds, thus cross-linking the complex. Then, a noncationic nano-delivery vector was constructed by breaking the imine bond and removing the cationic DETA side chain by dialysis at Ph = 5.0. The vector could encapsulate siRNA efficiently and resist protein adsorption in serum, and the modification of cRGD gave the vector suitable cancer cell targeting properties. In addition, the disulfide bond in the vector would break under the environment of high intra-cellular glutathione (GSH) pairs, which prompted the release of siRNA and achieved tumor-targeted gene silencing in vivo.', 'Biopolymer nanoparticles are excellent candidates for gene carriers due to their favorable physicochemical properties, bio-degradability,andbiocompatibility.29Theirsize,surface charge, and functional group tunability enable them to modu-late in vivo circulation time, cellular uptake, and nucleic acid adsorption behaviors.30 Biopolymerized polydopamine nano-particles (PDA NPs) are regarded as one of the typical plat-forms for drug delivery.', 'However, PDA NPs are inherently negatively charged, there-fore, not conducive to efficient nucleic acid loading. By modify-ing PEI on the surface of PDA NPs, efficient delivery of genes was achieved, but at the same time, the biotoxicity of the deliv-ery system was increased.31 In nature, encapsulation and pro-tection of DNA is usually achieved by protamine enriched with cationic arginine residues.32 Inspired by this, PDA NPs modi-fied with arginine-rich compounds proved to be beneficial for cellular uptake,33 but the low buffering capacity of poly-L-argi-nine (pArg) still hinders intracellular gene release and its endosomal escape. To overcome this challenge, Franck et al. modified PDA NPs with a mixture of poly-L-arginine and poly-L-histidine (pHis) for efficient delivery of pDNA (Fig. 2b).34 The presence of a sizeable ionizable imidazole fraction of poly-L-histidine promotes proton buffering inside the internal endo-cytic body, which in turn leads to their rupture through the proton sponge effect.35 By adjusting the ratio of pHis to pArg and the ratio of NPs to pDNA, comparable transfection efficiencies of Lipofectamine could be monitored by utilizing self-reported EGFP-pDNA. In addition, using commercially available mixtures of pArg and pHis dramatically reduces the cost of the delivery system.', '@', '@', '2.2Alteration of topological structure', 'It is promising to utilize different topologies of polymers to develop efficient polymeric gene delivery vectors. For example, more than 2500 linear PBAEs (LPBAEs) have been synthesized so far.36,37 Although the results of gene delivery tests of LPBAEs are encouraging, the linear nature of these polymers limits the potential for optimizing the structures. In 2016, Wang et al. constructed highly branched PBAEs (HPBAEs) by a facile A2 + B3 + C2 Michael addition strategy.38 The results showed that the transition from linear to branched structures introducedalargenumberoffunctionalend-groups, enhanced the interaction with DNA, and optimized the assem-bly behavior of the polymers. Thus, the gene transfection per-formanceofHPBAEswassignificantlyhigherthan LPBAEs.38,39 This discovery has made it more straightforward to scientists that the polymer vectors’ macromolecular struc-turesignificantlyimpactstheirtransfectionefficiency. Therefore, scientists have further developed various topologi-cal structures of polymers, including linear, branched, dendri-tic, star, and ring structures, to explore the effects of different topologies on gene transfection efficiency.40,41', 'Zhao et al. exploited a linear oligomer combinatorial branching strategy to create highly branched linear poly (β-amino esters) (H-LPBAEs). This unique strategy enabled a more homogeneous distribution of linear chain segments and branched units of H-LPAEs with molecular weights ranging from 11.8 kg mol−1 to 19.0 kg mol−1 (Fig. 2c).42 The optimized H-LPBAEs exhibited enhanced DNA condensation ability, and the positively charged H-LPBAE/DNA complexes demonstrated a high level of gene transfection efficiency in different cell lines. In SW1353 and BMSC cells, the optimized H-LPBAEs achieved 58.0% and 33.4% gene transfection efficiencies, 2.5 and 2.0 times higher than the commercially available gene transfection reagent Lipofectamine 3000, respectively. Teo et al. synthesized hetero-armed star polymer nanoparticles consisting of two main components, poly(dimethylamino ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) and poly[oligo poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate] (POEGMA), with cores connected by a cysteamine-based crosslinker.43 The positively charged polyelectrolyte PDMAEMA can be rapidly combined with anionic siRNA through electrostatic interaction. POEGMA is a brush polymer that reduces the positive charge of star nano-particles,increasestheirhydrophilicity,diminishescyto-toxicity, and improves serum resistance. Compared to linear DMAEMA polymers, star polymers offer higher siRNA transfec-tion efficiency, lower cytotoxicity, and more functionality due', '@', '@ to multiple polymer arms radiating outward from a central core. These arms have the potential to be designed to have stimuli-responsive or tumor-targeting elements.44', 'Cyclopolymers have attracted significant attention due to their unique 3D structures and properties. Previous studies have shown that polymers with cyclized structures typically have better biocompatibility and DNA encapsulation than poly-mers with linear or branched structures.39,45 Nanoparticles formed by cyclic polymers and genes are more compact and smaller than linear polymers. Li et al. used a cyclization stage control strategy to construct 3D cyclic poly(β-amino esters) (CPBAEs) with different ring sizes and ring topologies by regu-lating the cyclization tendency at various stages of step-growth polymerization (SGP) (Fig. 2d).2 The other ring shapes and end-group distributions of the individual CPBAEs were verified using fluorescence spectroscopy and 2D-NMR. Macrocyclic PAE (MCPBAE) and its complexes had significantly enhanced DNA condensation, cellular uptake, and DNA protection com-pared to other CPBAEs and HPBAEs, which promoted the expressionoftransfectedgenes.Thebest-performing MCPAE-C, -G, and -M exhibited higher transfection efficiencies than the best commercially available reagents, including Lipo 3000, jetPEI, and Xfect.2 In addition, MCPBAE with optimized end-groups could efficiently deliver CRISPR plasmids encoding both Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 nuclease and dual-guide sg RNA for in vitro gene editing.', '2.3Introduction of stimulus-responsive units', 'The smart stimulus-responsive delivery system responds to intrinsic stimuli from the TME, such as acidic pH, high redox, and overexpressed enzymes, enabling efficient gene delivery to the tumor location.18', '2.3.1pH-responsive. The development of polymers that can respond to narrow pH differences is an effective strategy to enhance the efficiency of systemic gene delivery.', 'Polycarboxylbetaine,poly(N-{N′-[N″-(2-carboxyethyl)-2-aminoethyl]-2-aminoethyl}glutamide) [PGlu(DET-Car)], where the ethylenediamine portion has two different acid dis-sociation constants. The PGlu (DET-Car) coated nano-particles show a neutral net charge at pH 7.4, transforming into a cation in acidic environments.46 Shen et al. constructed poly-meric complex micelles from PGlu (DET-Car) (PGDC) conju-gated branched PEIs for efficient pDNA delivery.47 The PGDC shells show a neutral charge under normal physiological con-ditions, resulting in prolonged blood circulation time. At pH 6.5, the PGDC shell becomes slightly cationized after enrich-ment in tumors through the leaky vasculature system, enhan-cing its retention effect at the tumor location and the efficiency of cellular internalization. The endosomal/lysosomal environment (pH 5.5) increases the PGDC shell layer’s cationic charge, facilitating endosomal escape and enabling efficient gene transfection (Fig. 3a).', 'The tertiary amine groups make it feasible to become more hydrophobic upon deprotonation or more cationic upon proto-nation, modulating the polymer’s hydrophobicity and cationic charge density by altering the pH. Xie et al. employed this pH-responsive amphiphilic polymer, m PEG-PC7A, to simul-taneously load Cas9 RNP and single-stranded oligodeoxynu-cleotides (ss ODN) via electrostatic and hydrophobic inter-actions.48 Intramuscular injection of the complex could effec-tively restore the muscle strength of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse model.', 'The use of charge-changed releasable transporters (CARTs) allows for the efficient delivery of polyanionic cargos, includ-ingmRNA,plasmidDNA,circRNA,andcombinations thereof.49–52 CARTs prepared by organocatalytic ring-opening polymerization (OROP) are block oligomers consisting of an initiator, one or more lipid blocks, and a polycationic block. At pH < 5.5, CART cationic blocks can bind polyanions by electro-static interaction. At physiological pH (∼7.4), the CART delivery system undergoes an oxygen-to-nitrogen (O-to-N) acyl transfer, which allows for an irreversible conversion to a neutral lactam, contributing to the release of the polyanion (Fig. 3b).50 Using a combinatorial lipid-screening strategy, McKinlay et al. pre-pared CARTs that bind both oleoyl and nonenyl lipids (named Oleyl-NoneneaminoCARTs),whichshowedsignificantly improved transfection efficiency (up to ∼80%) in Jurkat cells in T-lymphocyte cell line.53 ONA CARTs have been successfully used in the clinical development of prophylactic (COVID) and therapeutic (cancer and metastatic disease) vaccines54,55 and the generation of CAR-NK cells. However, the transfection efficiency of ONA CARTs on primary T cells is low, only 10%– 20%. To address this problem, their group used fingolimod as an initiator of CARTs, a small molecule targeting sphingosine-1 phosphate receptor (S1P1) on T and B lymphocytes,56 which showed better transfection ability of Jurkat cells in vitro. However, transfection of T cells was not improved in the mouse model. Therefore, they developed a CART delivery system with a β-amino carbonate (bAC) skeleton and syn-thesized a library of 24 bAC CARTs with different lipid compo-sitions using an organocatalytic ring-opening oligomerization reaction (Fig. 3b).57 Among them, the most potent bAC CARTs showed up to 70% primary T cell transfection in vitro, and, more importantly, in vivo delivery of the optimal bAC CARTs produced up to 97% splenic tropism and transfected 8% of primary splenic T cells that did not contain T cell-targeting ligands. This spleen tropism of bAC CARTs contributes to bio-medical applications such as T-cell immunotherapy while minimizing off-target effects.', '2.3.2Hypoxia-responsive. Hypoxia is a common feature of TME caused by inadequate oxygen supply and excessive oxygen consumption. Hypoxic TME induces high reducing stress and overexpression of some reductases, such as nitro and azoreductases. The hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) pathway is activated under hypoxic conditions, and HIF-1 α, the oxygen-unstable α-subunit, is stabilized and overexpressed, which is involved in tumor angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance by either promoting epithelial– mesenchymal transition or activating its downstream path-ways, thereby inducing more invasive and metastatic pheno-types. Therefore, overexpression of HIF-1 α is a reverse indi-cator of tumor prognosis. It has also become a target for tumor therapy.58 Liu et al. developed micelles assembled from monomethoxy polyethyleneglycol (mPEG) and PLL copoly-mers, in which azo-compounds (AZO) acted as hypoxia-respon-sive bridges between m PEG and PLL. Once exposed to a hypoxic environment, the AZO bridge was severed by over-expressed azoreductase, leading to depolymerization of the micelles and rapid release of the cargo (Fig. 3c).59 The results in vitro and in vivo showed that the micelles delivered both drug and shRNA to the hypoxia site and promoted the release of DOX and shHIF-1α, which not only improved the antitumor activity of DOX but also efficiently silenced the HIF-1 α pathway and regulated the tumor microenvironment, further improved drug and shRNA delivery, and inhibited the growth and distant metastasis of primary triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumors in a mouse model of in situ TNBC.', '2.3.3Reduction-responsive. The intracellular concentration of glutathione (GSH) is 1000 times higher than the extracellu-lar concentration and 7–10 times higher than normal cells.60The p-2,4-dinitrophenyl ether in the cationic polymer poly{N-[2-(acryloyloxy)ethyl]-N-[p(2,4-dinitrophenoxy)benzyl]-N,N-di-ethylamine} (PADDAC) is specifically cleaved by GSH, convert-ing the ammonium cation to a carboxylate anion, which results in the rapid intracellular release of DNA from the complex.61 Disulfide bonds can also be introduced into the cationic polymer in response to the high concentration of GSH in the tumor cells. The high concentration of GSH will reduce and break the disulfide bonds, leading to the degradation of the cationic polymer and the rapid release of the loaded nucleic acids.62 Such a chemical structure can improve trans-fection efficiency and reduce cytotoxicity. Chen et al. prepared polyhydroxylated cationic gene nanocarriers (TCs) via a one-pot ring-opening reaction of triglycidyl isocyanurate (TGIC) with cystamine (CA) for delivery of miR-22 to osteosarcoma cells (Fig. 3d).63 The reduction-responsive degradative pro-', '@', '@ perties of the TCs enabled them to exhibit low cytotoxicity and demonstrate excellent transfection performance in osteosar-coma cells.', '2.3.4Reactive oxygen species response. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a broadly applied stimulus-responsive signal, and ROS levels are significantly higher in cancer cells than in normal cells. Therefore, responsive nanosystems designed based on various ROS-cleavable groups (e.g., selenides, disele-nides, thioketals, and tellurides) are commonly employed for gene delivery.64 Zhang et al. constructed an ultrasound (US)-enhanced ROS-responsive charge reversal polymer nanocarrier (BTIL)by encapsulatingthecoreoftheBPDEAEA/DNA complex in liposomes loaded with IR780 (Fig. 3e).65US stimu-lation activates the sonosensitizer (IR780) and transfers energy to nearby oxygen molecules, generating high levels of ROS. Under the oxidation of ROS, the quaternary ammonium salt in thecationicpolymerB-PDEAEAreleasesp-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (HMP), which is converted to a tertiary amine, indu-cing the conversion of the polyacrylate to negatively charged polyacrylic acid, which results in the release of TRAIL. TRAIL is a gene that specifically kills tumor cells without affecting normal cells. In addition, the PEGylated liposome shell pro-moted the stability and circulation time of TRAIL in blood cir-culation,whichfurtherimprovedthegenetransfection efficiency. The diselenide bond is a classical chemical bond capable of responding to reactive oxygen species, which can be oxidized to –SeOOH and fractured.66 Therefore, Xianyu et al. prepared polymers containing diselenium bonds, which were grafted with branched polyethyleneimine, and could effectively bind PD-L1 SiRNA to form a stable nanocomplex.67 The nano-complex could potently deliver SiRNA into cancer cells, which breaks under the stimulation of ROS, releasing the loaded siRNA and silencing PD-L1, thus blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint pathway. Meanwhile, –SeOOH down-regu-lated HLA-E expression, blocked the HLA-E/NKG2A immune checkpoint pathway, and activated NK cell-mediated tumor immunity. The nanocomplex effectively prevented the growth of xenograft tumors by blocking dual immune checkpoint receptors.', '2.3.5Multi-response. PAMAM dendrimers are ideal vectors for gene delivery due to their nano-size, low toxicity, high nucleicacidcompressibility,andhightransfection efficiency.68 Phenylboronate ester bond have been shown to have excellent TME responsiveness and can dissociate at low pH and high ROS conditions.69Liu et al. constructed core–shell structured dendritic macromolecules (CSTDs) by taking lacto-bionic acid (LA)-modified 5th generation PAMAM dendritic macromolecules encapsulating gold nanoparticles as the core and phenylboronic PBA-modified 3rd generation PAMAM den-dritic macromolecules as shells through the phenylboronate ester bond formed between PBA and LA.70 The formed Au CSTDs have been utilized to efficiently complex Cas9-PD-L1 pDNA (Cas9-PD-L1). Due to the specific binding of PBA to over-expressed sialic acid in cancer cells, Cas9-PD-L1 could be released with the breaking of the phenylboronate ester bond, escape lysosomes, and localize to the nucleus, resulting in an efficient knockout of the PD-L1 gene. In addition, due to the X-ray attenuation effect of Au, CT images can be provided for its distribution and metabolism. Dong et al. constructed light/ pH dual-responsive cationic supramolecular block copolymer vectors (SBCs) based on the non-covalent polymerization of β-cyclodextrin monosubstituted polyethylene glycol (PEG-β-CD) as a supramolecular initiator via β-cyclodextrin/azobenzene-terminated pentaethylenehexamine (DMA-Azo-PEHA-β-CD) in aqueous medium (Fig. 3f).71 SBC possesses excellent biostabil-ity, biocompatibility, and efficient plasmid DNA condensation ability. The acidic environment of the endosomes protonates the amino groups on the vector and promotes the endosomal escape of the vector. Light irradiation at 450 nm will make azo-benzene allosteric, which induces the depolymerization of the vector, resulting in the rapid release of plasmid DNA. The dual-responsivecharacteristicsoftheSBCsignificantly improved its gene transfection efficiency of the SBC in COS-7 and HeLa cells. However, the light penetration depth of 450 nm is too shallow for deep tissue delivery, so there is a need to develop photoresponsive polymers at higher wave-lengths. Kuang et al. employed upconverting nanoparticles to convert 980 nm light to partially UV light, which induced the breakage of the backbone polymers, thus accelerating the release of siPlk168.72', '2.4Utilization of mechanistic stimuli', 'In living organisms, chemical and mechanical signals continu-ously influence and coordinate the activities of cellular life, such as motility, proliferation, and phenotypic transition events.73 Endocytosis and transport processes are similarly regulated by interactions between the cell membrane and the underlying cytoskeleton.74 Different mechanical stimuli can improve gene transfer by modulating specific steps in the transmission pathway, including internalization, cytoplasmic transport, and nuclear entry.75 Mechanical loads applied to cells cause specific cellular responses, such as mechanical regulationofmembranetransport76andcytoskeletal remodeling.77,78 In this context, cyclic stretching,79 shear stress,80 and vibrational loading81 may improve the transfec-tion efficiency of non-viral gene delivery vectors by enhancing their uptake and intracellular transport. Ponti et al. propose a method to enhance intracellular delivery and improve transfec-tion efficiency by using mechanical stimulation to initiate cells. A short-lived high-frequency vibrational load (t = 5 min, f = 1000 Hz) applied vertically to the plane of the cell culture plate induces abrupt and extensive plasma membrane growth, triggering the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway that makes it easier for the cells to internalize the polymer gene vector, leading to an increase in the transfection efficiency from 10-fold to 100-fold.81 This process is safe for the cells, whichrecoverafter1hourthroughplasmamembrane remodeling.', '2.5Modification of polymers', 'Rational modification of polymers can enable polymeric vectors to possess high transfection efficiency while maintain-ing excellent biocompatibility. For example, polyethyleneimine (PEI) is the most widely studied polycationic vector with different molecular weights (0.2–800 kDa), and linear and branched structures.82 Due to its high transfection efficiency in cells, the branched PEI 25 kDa is generally regarded as the “gold standard” of polycationic non-viral vectors.83 However, the cytotoxicity of PEI increases as its molecular weight rises, giving an antagonistic relationship between high transfection efficiency and low cytotoxicity. Modifications such as polyethyl-ene glycol (PEG), lipid, or fluoride have been introduced into PEI polymers to address this critical issue and reduce the bio- toxicity of the delivery system.84 PEG-modified PEIs can shield the positively charged surface of the complexes by forming a hydrophilic corona, which reduces damage to the cell mem-brane. Due to the amphiphilicity of lipids, lipid-modified PEI makes PCC more stable and has better biocompatibility.85Perfluoroalkyl-containing polymers exhibit favorable serum re-sistance due to the hydrophobicity and lipophobicity of fluoro-carbon chains.86', 'carbon chains.862.5.1Fluoridemodification.Fluorinemodificationon polymers is an effective method to enhance gene delivery, such as PAMAM,87 poly(propyleneimine) (PPI),88 peptide den-drimers,89 PEI,90 PBAE,91 poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl meth-acrylate) (pDMAEMA).92 Fluorine substitution can regulate the conformation, hydrophobic interactions, lipophilicity, electro-negativity, and basicity of the carriers, thereby altering their bioactivity and bioavailability, and enhancing their membrane permeability and therapeutic effects. Deng et al. introduced the fluorine-containing amine monomer 1H,1H-undecafluoro-hexylamine (FPBAE) into PBAE, and the complexes with DNA achieved high transfection efficiencies of 87% and 55% in difficult-to-transfected cells, HepG2 and Molt-4, much higher than that of Lipofectamine 3000 (Fig. 4a).93 Jin et al. prepared a gene delivery system containing fluorinated low molecular weight PEI for miR-942-5 psponge gene delivery by modifying tetrafluoroterephthalaldehyde on PEI 1.8 kDa by one-step syn-thesis (Fig. 4b).94 The synthesized F-PEI could bind tightly to negatively charged plasmids due to its positive electropositive, hydrophobic and oleophobic properties and exhibited excel-lent serum stability in vivo. The F-PEI/Plasmids complex (w/w = 50) showed about 6-fold endocytosis capacity of PEI 25 kDa and resulted in a high survival rate of human NSCLC cells (H1299), and in vivo studies also demonstrated its ability to inhibit tumor growth and angiogenesis effectively. Zhang et al. developedfluoropolymer-encapsulatedDNAnanoclusters (FNCs)forthecyclicdeliveryofoligonucleotides.95Oligonucleotides were bound in DNA nanorings via Watson– Crick hydrogen bonds, followed by in situ polymerization of fluorinated zwitterionic monomers and adsorption onto the DNA nanorings via hydrogen bonds. The results showed that the fluorinated polymer coating prolonged the cycling time of the complexes and facilitated the cellular internalization and endosomal escape of the DNA nanocycles. Incorporating core– shell structured PbS@CdS quantum dots (with emission wave-lengths of 1500–1700 nm) into the polymer coatings allowed the delivery process of the complexes to be visualized on a cel-lular scale utilizing near-infrared light sheet microscopy. In addition, the photothermal effect of the quantum dots can trigger hydrogen bond dissociation, inducing detachment of thefluoropolymercoatingandon-demandreleaseof oligonucleotides.', '2.5.2Amino acid modifications. Amino acids are essential naturally occurring nutrients with good biocompatibility. Amino acids are the structural monomers that make up pro-teins and have the same general structure consisting of an amino group, a carboxyl group, and a residue. The chemical diversity of amino acid residues, such as amines, guanidines, imidazoles, carboxyls, hydroxyls, thiols, amides, lipids, and aromatic rings, can affect various aspects of gene delivery.96For example, the pKa for imidazole protonation in histidine is about 6.0,97 so in acidic endosomes, histidine residues enhance the escape of the complex by a proton sponge mecha-nism.98 Adjusting the affinity water balance on the surface of dendrimer macromolecules with hydrophobic amino acids (e.g., tyrosine and phenylalanine) facilitates enhanced cellular uptake. Modifications with arginine and lysine promote DNA binding, multimer formation, efficient cellular uptake, and endosomal escape but also increase cytotoxicity. Dendrimers modified with anionic or hydrophilic amino acids decrease DNA binding and cellular uptake.99 Therefore, selecting the appropriate type and ratio of amino acid modification for poly-meric vectors is necessary to achieve optimal transfection efficiency and cell survival.', 'Amino acid-modified polymer delivery systems have dra-maticallyincreaseinbiocompatibilityandtransfection efficiency. This is attributed to the fact that amino acid modifi-cation reduces the charge density of the cationic polymer carrier and increases the interaction with nucleic acids while improving cellular uptake efficiency and endosomal escape. Polyamide-amines grafted with histidine and arginine (second-generation PAM) can have higher endosomal escape and higher transfection efficiency than unmodified PAM due to the proton buffering and protein transduction peptide effects of histidine and arginine.100 Partial modification of the PAMAM dendrimer with tosyl arginine allowed the dendrimer to increase its transfection efficiency while minimizing its cyto-toxicity.101 Joubert et al. precisely introduced p-toluenesulfonyl arginine and imidazole groups on the lysine-carrying PAMAM, which effectively improved its fusion properties, buffering capacity, and facilitated endosomal escape (Fig. 4c).102 The arginine-rich polymer, which can effectively form pores in the cell membrane and translocate into them, avoids endo/lysoso-mal trapping, resulting in a significant increase in the efficiency of cellular internalization.103 By screening for struc-ture–activity relationships, the polymer with a side chain con-taining two arginine residues and a flexible hexanoic acid linker (PTn-R2-C6) showed higher transfection efficiency and lower cytotoxicity than the gold standard transfection reagent (PEI 25K).', 'L-PBAEs are a class of polymers with promising biocompat-ibility and biodegradability.104 Due to the presence of basic amine groups, L-PBAEs are able to condense nucleic acids in the form of nanocomplexes, making them a strong candidate for gene vectors. Their transfection efficiency and selectivity for different cell types can also be tuned by synthetically modi-fying the PBAE backbone or the polymer ends.105 For instance, due to the excellent biocompatibility of peptides, Borrós’ group developed a library of linear oligopeptide-modified PBAEs (OM-PBAEs) with terminal oligopeptides as the cationic portion.106,107 Among them, peptides such as lysine, arginine, and histidine are susceptible to protonation at intestinal luminal pH, which is more conducive to endosomal escape owing to the “proton sponge effect”. Hence, these OM-PBAE polymers show promising applications such as protection of mRNA for vaccine purposes,108 encapsulation of interfering RNA for cardiovascular disease therapy,109 incorporation of various gene editing systems (CRISPR/Cas) for the treatment of rare monogenic diseases,110 preparation of hydrogels for loca-lized siRNA therapy for breast cancer or microneedles loaded with immune-modulating components.106', '@', '@', '2.5.3Hydrophobicmodification.Sinceliposomesand LNPs are characterized by their amphiphilicity, they can effec-tively encapsulate and protect nucleic acids and promote cell membrane permeabilization, uptake of lipid complexes and endosomal escape.111 Although polymers have the advantages of easy large-scale synthesis, high flexibility in chemical com-position and structure, and large functional space, their trans-fection efficiency is relatively low.112 Therefore, hydrophobic modification of polymers by mimicking the amphiphilic struc-ture of liposomes and LNPs is an effective strategy to improve their gene delivery efficiency. Anderson et al. introduced the hydrophobic amine dodecylamine (C12) into the hydrophilic amine 2-morpholinoethylamine (90) in a 7 : 3 cast ratio, which significantlyimprovedthestability ofthecomplexand enhanced the transfection efficiency of DNA.113 Liu et al. intro-duced undecylamine (C11) into branched poly(β-amino ester), which enhanced DNA’s condensation, delivery, and transfec-tionefficiency.114However,thischemicalmodification approac makes the chemical composition of the resulting poly-mers complex and uncontrollable, and most importantly, this strategyistime-consumingandcomplicatedtooperate. Inspired by the modularity strategy, Li et al. fabricated β-cyclodextrin-based cationic modules and adamantyl-functio-nalized guanidinium-based polymer modules via host–guest interaction to form a micellar delivery system for the efficient delivery of pDNA.115 Shi et al. then synthesized hydrophilic LPAE and hydrophobic LPAE separately, which were then co-condensed with DNA to form a ternary complex. By adjusting the proportion of hydrophilic and hydrophobic LPAEs, the hydrophilicity, size, ζ-potential, and other physicochemical properties of the ternary complexes could be altered, contri-buting to the regulation of gene transfection (Fig. 4d and e).116', '2.5.4Targetedmodifications.Modifyingofpolymeric vectors with targeted ligands can provide additional impetus to polymeric nanocarriers to effectively enhance the enrich-ment of polymeric vectors to the target site, thereby increasing cellularuptake,release,andtransfectionefficiency. Phenylboronic acid (PBA) is a biocompatible group capable of forming reversible covalent esters with 1,2- or 1,3-cis-diols on the ribose ring.117 Therefore, PBA has been applied as a ligand targeting cells target cells overexpressing sialic acid. PBA-func-tionalized cationic dendrimers were used for efficient DNA and siRNA delivery, and the gene delivery efficiency of PEI was improved by PBA modification.118,119 Angiopep-2 peptide is a ligand that binds to low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1), which is highly expressed on blood–brain barrier (BBB) endothelial cells and glioblastoma (GBM) cells. Zou et al. modified Angiopep-2 on a polymer shell to facilitate BBB permeation and achieve targeted delivery of Cas9/sgRNA to GBM cells in the brain.120 Dendritic macromolecules modi-fied with glucose, mannose, or galactose modifications can target up-regulated glucose transporters in glioblastoma to promote brain penetration and cellular internalization for gene delivery to the brain, leading to effective treatment of glioblastoma.121 Polymeric vectors with galactose-modified side chains also showed better ability to target HCC cells for gene delivery.122 Polymer vectors grafted with RGD can target integrin overexpressing cells and improve cellular uptake efficiency.123 Han et al. attempted gene delivery to glioblas-toma using CM-coated PEI/pDNA nanoparticles, taking advan-tage of the homotypic targeting effect of cancer cell mem-branes (CM).124 The nanoparticles’ surface CM reduced their interaction with serum proteins, extended their in vivo circula-tion time, and facilitated their entry into target cells by inter-acting with the cells’ plasma membrane. Zhuang et al. pre-pared a delivery system coated with LA-4 lung epithelial cell membrane (CM) that significantly improved the delivery efficiency of pDNA to the lungs, surpassing the anti-inflamma-tory effect of the delivery system without cell membrane encapsulation.125', '2.6Incorporation of machine learning', 'Machine-learning based techniques permit more efficient experiment design by obtaining optimal results with fewer experiments.126 High-throughput computer simulation evalu-ation methods for biomaterials can accelerate delivery device optimization and development by exploring large chemical design spaces more quickly and cost-effectively. Gong et al. apply state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to a dataset of synthetic biodegradable PBAEs, which have excellent thera-peutic gene delivery capabilities in vitro and in vivo.127 Polymer properties are the input part of this dataset, and polymer nanoparticle transfection performance and nanoparticle tox-icity in different cells are the output part of this dataset. These data were used to train and evaluate several state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to predict transfection and the abilitytounderstandstructure–functionrelationships (Fig. 5a). By developing a coding scheme to vectorize the struc-ture of PBAE polymers in a machine-readable format, it was proved that the Random Forest model could predict in vitro DNA transfection based on the chemical structure of PBAE polymers in a cell line-dependent manner. The PBAE gene delivery system prepared based on this model was tested for transfection in RAW 264.7 macrophages and Hep3B hepatocel-lular carcinoma cells, and the results showed Spearman’s R correlation between experimental/tested transfection signifi-cance of 0.57 and 0.66, respectively.', 'Gaussian process (GP) modeling has succeeded dramati-cally due to its non-parametric nature, enabling fast black-box optimization of very few data points. It is the best tool for hyperparametric tuning in machine-learning experiments.128In order to investigate whether oppositely charged hybrid micelles maintain high transfection efficiency while having excellent cytocompatibility, Leer et al. synthesized two sets of oppositely charged double-block terpolymers.128 The two sets of copolymers contain the same hydrophobic poly(n-butyl acry-late) (PnBA) and hydrophilic 4-acryloylmethane (NAM). The charge difference lies in the fact that the cationic copolymer is modifiedwith3-guanidinoacrylamide(GPAm),andthe anionic copolymer is modified with 2-carboxyethylacrylamide (CEAm), which is negatively charged under neutral conditions. Variations in copolymer composition and the form of different ratios between the blended polymers allow for a myriad of pos-sibilities for micellar structures, and optimizing such systems requires a large number of experiments ranging from chemical synthesis to biological studies. A machine learning approach was therefore applied to determine the optimal GPAm/CEAm ratio, resulting in higher transfection efficiency and cell survi-val with less resource overhead. After two runs, the optimal ratio to overcome the toxicity-efficiency dilemma was deter-mined. Applying machine learning to polymer chemistry holds great potential to efficiently process many possible combi-nations for probing robust gene vectors.', '2.7Probing the effect of distribution of different molecular weight fractions', 'Unlike viruses and lipids with defined chemical structures, synthetic polymeric vectors (e.g., PAE, PEI, PLL, DMAEMA) are mixtures of different molecular weight (MW) components, which perform their respective functions and play a synergistic role in the process of gene delivery.129,130 Polymer components with high molecular weight can act as a framework to stabilize the polymer structure and protect the core DNA.129 In contrast, high molecular weight components cannot effectively shield the DNA charge due to their sizeable steric hindrance, whereas mobile small molecular weight components can sufficiently shield the negative residue charge on the phosphate group, thus assisting the DNA in further coiling and folding.131 In addition, other molecular weight components may facilitate cellular uptake, endosomal escape, and nuclear pore entry of the polymer vector.', '@', '@', 'Therefore, to improve the efficiency of gene transfection, it is necessary to determine the optimal combination ratio of different polymer components in polymer vectors, i.e., polymer component distribution (PCD). Li et al. used PBAE as the research object to investigate the effects of different properties of different components of polymers (high MW and low MW components) and the synergistic effect on gene delivery after combiningtheminappropriateratios(Fig.5b).132The relationship between PCD and gene transfer performance was investigated using an artificial intelligence (AI) analysis. Guided by this analysis, a series of highly efficient polymeric vectors superior to the current commercial reagents jetPEI and Lipo3000 were developed, among which the transfection efficiency of the PAE – B1-based complex in U251 cells was about 1.5 times that of Lipo3000 and 2.0 times that of jetPEI.', '2.8Combined use of multiple means', 'Improvement of polymeric vectors by a single means is always limited for gene transfection efficiency, and the combined use of multiple means will have a greater chance of facilitating gene transfection, reducing the dosage of drugs, and driving clinical transformation. Karlsson et al. designed reductively cleavable PBAEs (XbNPs) containing photocrosslinked poly- mers to cross-link and load encapsulated siRNAs.133 The di-sulfide bridge in XbNPs is conducive to the intracellular releaseofsiRNAunderweakacidconditions. Photocrosslinking improves the stability of XbNPs, shields the surface charge, and reduces the adsorption of serum proteins. Under high serum conditions, XbNPs showed better siRNA-mediated knockdown effects in various glioblastoma cell lines and melanoma cells than uncrosslinked preparations.', 'To achieve stable co-encapsulation and efficient delivery of siRNA and hydrophilic chemicals for anti-inflammatory treat-ment of ulcerative colitis (UC), Xu et al. synthesized poly(ethyl-ene glycol)-b-poly(trimethylene carbonate-co-dithiolocyclic tri-methylene carbonate)-b-polyethyleneimine (PEG-P(TMC-DTC))-PEI, which self-assembled to form polymer vesicles with PEG in the outer shell and PEI facing an inner hydrophilic core.134The disulfide heterocyclic pentane ring suspended in the P(TMC-DTC) block can be oxidized to a disulfide bond while enhancingcolloidalstability.Themacrophage-targeting peptide TKPR was further modified at the PEG end to make it macrophage-targeting. Electrostatic interactions between PEI and siTNF – αsiRNA/DSP promoted efficient cargo encapsula-tion. Upon targeted internalization into macrophages, the di-sulfide bond is fractured by GSH reduction, which accelerates the dissociation of polymer vesicles and the release of cargoes to achieve the anti-inflammatory effect of synergistic anti-UC. Li et al. developed novel pH-responsive lipid polymer nano-particles (PLPNs) combined with Ultrasound-mediated micro-bubble destruction (UMMD) technology to achieve optimal CRISPRi systemic delivery, leading to efficient target gene inhi-bition135 (Fig. 6a). UMMD induces mechanical perturbation of vascular walls and cell membranes, thereby enhancing the per-meability of malignant tissues to DNA carriers.136 PLPNs have a core–shell structure in which the CRISPR plasmid DNA (pDNA) with PBA functionalized low molecular weight poly-ethyleneimine PEI1.8 k (PEI-PBA) condensed to nucleate. The PEIPBA/pDNA complex was further encapsulated in pH-acti-vated “detachable” PEOz lipids. The PEOz lipid shell gives PLPNs a negatively charged surface with good serum resistance and effectively reduces immune clearance. Upon entry into the tumor tissue, the outer shell of PLPNs breaks down in the acidicmicroenvironment,releasingthePEI-PBA/pDNA complex, which is capable of enhancing the internalization of the complex by cancer cells through the binding of salivary acid (SA). PEI in the complex triggers endosomal rupture through a “proton sponge” effect, releasing pDNA into the cytoplasm. In contrast, some of the undecomposed PLPNs enter the cell via endocytosis, and in an acidic (pH 5.0) environment, the outer shell is almost completely decom-posed, which triggers the release of pDNA. In addition, in vivo studies demonstrated that UMMD administration significantly increased the tumor enrichment of PLPNs and improved gene repression efficiency. Zhang et al. constructed a peptide con-taining nuclear localization signals (NLS) and a Tefilin-modi-fied disulfide-bonded crosslinked polymer (bPEI-SSPEG-T) for efficient delivery of interleukin-10 (IL-10) pDNA.137 First, NLS formed a complex with pDNA by electrostatic interaction to enhance the nucleation efficiency.

Especially in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the recurrence rate increases, and long-term survival decreases after conventional treatment. In breast cancer research, scientists have identified various therapeutic targets to inhibit tumor metastasis and recurrence through effective gene delivery and silencing responsive targets.140 Li et al. selected metastatic breast cancer as an in vivo gene inhi-bitionmodelfortheCRISPRisystem.135MicroRNA-10b (miR-10b) is highly expressed in metastatic breast tumors and becomesatherapeutictargetforanti-metastasis.Thus, sgRNAs targeting miR-10b were developed. Subsequently, PLPNs/miR-10b were constructed and combined with the UMMD to introduce a powerful gene suppression toolbox into tumor cells and tissues to inhibit tumor metastasis efficiently. Zhang et al. chose antisense miR-21 oligonucleotide (anti21) as the therapeutic sequence for cancer cells via fluoropolymer-coated DNA nanocrystals. Silencing miR-21 can inhibit the secretionofvascularendothelialgrowthfactor(VEGF) secretion, inhibiting tumor angiogenesis.95 The fluorinated polymeric coating was also doped with quantum dots with NIR-IIb (1500–1700 nm) fluorescence and NIR photothermal properties. In the humanized breast cancer model, after anti21 was effectively delivered to breast cancer cells through circula-tion (Fig. 7a), under NIR light irradiation, anti21 could be released in the cytoplasm on demand, achieving high transfec-tion efficiency, effective silencing of target miRNAs, and inhi-bition of angiogenesis for tumor ablation (Fig. 7b). In addition, non-invasive volumetric imaging of the gene vector delivery process can be performed under NIR-IIb emission.', 'The efficacy of tumor therapy will be further enhanced when co-delivering multiple therapeutic and adjuvant mRNAs.

However, articular cartilage itself has no blood vessels, nerve tissue, and lymphatic distribution, and the extracellular matrix of chondrocytes is dense (pore size of about 60 nm) and has a negative electrical barrier, making it difficult to deliver drugs/genes to chondrocytes.153 Therefore, it is necess-ary to ensure the effective retention of gene carriers in the jointcavitywhileenhancingtheirenrichmentaround chondrocytes.', 'Based on hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene as the core, Chen et al. synthesized a phosphorus-containing dendrimer deriva-tive (G1-NC5·HCl) with piperidine on the surface by an itera-tive modification method, which can be effectively combined with HIF2α siRNA (G1-NC5·HC@siRNA).154 The cationic nano-carriersachievedefficientpenetrationintothecartilage damage site (pH = 6.6) and effective anchoring to the cartilage matrix (pH = 7.6).

When inhaled through a nebulizer, microdroplets carrying the nano-formulation were deposited in the alveoli and subsequently penetrated the fibrotic foci, leading to the shedding of the outer KGFs due to the trigger-ing of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). After the RGD-grafted coreswere revealed, the nano-formulationcould specifically target integrin-rich cells for intracellular delivery of mMMP13.

LNPs composed of poly PLGA core and DPPC lipid shell (hNPs) could effectively transport siRNA to the lungs.171 The siRNA targeting NFκB was encapsulated in hNPs, and effective NFκB gene silencing was achieved in LPS-stimulated human bronchial epithelial cells.', 'Intravenous administration is a direct method to reach the treatment site. Still, it is usually limited to organs outside the reticuloendothelial system (RES), such as the liver, spleen, and kidneys, rendering the drug more off-target effects and cyto-toxicity in treating inflammation in the lungs.172,173 Therefore, Jeon et al. delivered siRNAs to the site of inflammation in the lungs by systemic drug delivery using guanidinium-functiona-lized poly(oxanorbornene)imide (PONI-Guan) polymers as a gene carrier to knock down tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in lung cells for attenuating the lung inflammation (Fig. 9c).174Specifically, PONI-Guan homopolymers self-assembled with siRNA via electrostatic interactions to form discrete (∑170 nm) and cationic surface-charged nanocomplexes. These complexes transport siRNA (0.14–0.28 mg kg−1) directly into the cytosol via a membrane fusion-like uptake process, achieving efficient (>70%) GFP reporter gene knockdown in macrophages (mice peritoneal macrophages (raw264.7)). Intravenous injection of the PONI – Guan/siRNA complex in LPS-stimulated mice resulted in a 3-fold increase in lung localization (Fig. 9d), showing an internal tendency for inflamed lung tissue while efficiently knocking down serum TNF-α (>80%) (Fig. 9e). The system efficiently delivers siRNA to the cytoplasm, administer-ing the drug at significantly lower levels than contemporary clinical studies while reducing the risk of off-target effects.', '3.6Others', 'Delivery of nucleic acids to the retina remains a major chal-lenge due to the eye’s unique anatomy and various barriers. Tan et al. developed a core–shell delivery platform for targeted delivery to the retina, with an inner core consisting of amino acid-functionalizeddendrimersandnuclearlocalization signals for DNA complexation, nuclear translocation, and efficient transfection.175 The inner core was encapsulated in a pH-sensitive lipid bilayer. Hyaluronic acid (HA)-1,2-dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) is used as the outermost shell layer for retinal cell targeting. The environment in the vitreous does not affect the movement of negatively charged vectors and can diffuse into the retina, enter retinal cells via the CD44-mediated internalization pathway, and finally con-clude into the nucleus via NLS translocation for efficient trans-fection. Guo et al. designed copolymers (PACDs) consisting of hydrophilic PEGblocks,siRNA-binding blocks,andpH-responsive blocks.176 The PACDs and siRNA can be simply mixed and self-assembled into nano-sized polymeric micelles. Due to the pH-responsiveness, PACD/siRNA complexes exhibit excellent endosomal escape efficiency and gene silencing efficiency both in vitro and in vivo. The hydrophilic shell, small size, and slight positive charge of the PACD/siRNA complexes enable them to effectively circumvent the intraocular clearance mechanism after a single injection, rapidly distribute in all retina layers, and remain in the retina for more than a week. In addition, the PACD/siVEGFA complex inhibited angio-genesis in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy withoutcausinganyinflammatoryorhistopathological changes. This study has implications for the development of efficient ocular gene delivery systems.', 'The yes-associated protein (YAP) is a crucial driver of epi-dermalgrowthfactorreceptortyrosinekinaseinhibitor (EGFR-TKI) resistance. Inhibition of YAP expression is a poten-tial therapeutic option for treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Huang et al. proposed a nanococktail therapeutic strategyutilizingastimuli-responsiveblockeddendritic polymer, Ppa-conjugate polyOEGMA-blockpoly[Dendron(G3)-Ppa] (Polymer), to simultaneously co-deliver YAP siRNA, a photosensitizer (Ppa) and EGFR – TKI gefitinib (Gef) 3 thera-peutic units to achieve targeted drug/gene/photodynamic therapy.177 The formed complexes were efficiently internalized into Gef-resistant NSCLC cells and successfully escaped from late endosomes/lysosomes. The disulfide bonds in the complex break in response to the intracellular reducing environment, efficiently releasing Gef and YAP – siRNA. Released Gef inhibits the EGFR signaling pathway, while YAP – siRNA blocks the Gef resistance bypass pathway. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) elev-ated the intracellular ROS level to promote apoptosis in tumor cells. In addition, inhibition of glycolysis also promoted apopto-sis by down-regulating HIF – 1 α expression, which significantly alleviated PDT-induced hypoxia.', '4.Conclusions and perspectives', 'In recent years, gene therapy has made significant progress both in basic research and clinical fields due to the extensive development of efficient delivery systems. To date, a variety of polymers, such as derivatives based on PEI, polyesters, polya-mino acids, and dendrimers, have been used as gene delivery vectors. Scientists have adopted various strategies to improve transfection efficiency in vitro and in vivo, modifying and designing polymer structures at the molecular level, tuning the complexes at the nanoparticle level, and combining artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the efficiency of gene delivery. The polymeric gene vectors have achieved excel-lent therapeutic effects in some disease models, providing a basis for future clinical translation.', 'Based on the broad prospect of gene therapy, we look forward to the future development of high-performance gene vectors. (1) Since most of the current studies focus on the transfection efficiency of cells, the research on the transfection of polymer vectors still needs to be completed. Therefore, further clarification of the relationship between the compo-sition and structure of the vectors and the various stages in the transfection process will help to design high-performance polymer gene vectors. (2) The PDI of polymers is extensive, and polymers with different molecular weights play different roles in the delivery process. Therefore, preparing polymers with narrower molecular weight distributions will help to clarify the relationship between polymer structure and func-tion. (3) The development of novel bio-responsive and photo-/ thermo-/ultrasound/magneto-responsivedeliveryvectorsto spatiotemporally control the release of genes will contribute to the on-demand delivery of drugs and precise treatment of dis-eases. A thorough understanding of the cellular internalization pathways of polymeric nanocarriers and their fates in cells will contribute to the optimization of polymeric vectors and bring out the full function of genes in the cell. (4) Prime Editing (PE) is a gene editing technology that enables arbitrary base substi-tutions, DNA fragment insertion, and deletion.178 The develop-ment of polymer vectors suitable for PE delivery will promote the further development of gene therapy. (5) Animal experi-ments always have deviations in predicting human results due to significant differences between species. Therefore, it is necessary to develop more appropriate and standardized disease models that can better represent physiological con-ditions, to provide highly relevant data for developing human gene drugs. (6) Utilizing high-throughput evaluation methods to establish a more comprehensive and unified evaluation system will help integrate and analyze data to design high-per-formance polymer vectors. Scientists have now developed and tested the performances of a large number of polymer vectors, which is a vast database. Therefore, an effective combination of computer-aided learning strategies, using data-driven ana-lysis of the relationship between polymer structure and per-formances to make accurate predictions of next-generation polymers, would significantly save time and resources.', 'The development of efficient and safe polymeric gene deliv-ery vectors requires collaborative efforts among scientists from multiple fields, such as molecular biology, polymer chemistry, physical chemistry, biomedicine, and computer artificial intel-ligence. It is foreseeable that shortly, more and more polymer nanomaterials can be used as effective gene nanocarriers, which can be validated in clinical experiments and applied to the effective treatment of various diseases.', 'Author contributions', 'Y.

Ristić2 · Berta B. Holló3 · Vesna Nikolić1 · Nada Č. Nikolić1 · Srđan Rakić4 · Snežana Ilić‑Stojanović1', 'Received: 16 April 2024 / Revised: 20 September 2024 / Accepted: 13 October 2024 /   Published online: 23 October 2024  © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024 The applications of polyurethanes (PURs) have increased in recent years. They can have pharmaceutical applications as potential drug delivery carriers, due to their properties which can be adjusted according to their chemical structure. In this paper, the synthesis of PURs and their characterization were examined. Two series of PURs were synthesized by using β-cyclodextrin (βCD) or hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin as cross-linker of alicyclic isophorone diisocyanate and three glycols: polyethylene glycols (PEG2000 and PEG6000) and poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (BLOCK 1100). The NCO/OH molar ratio was 3.3, 4.3 and 6.3, and thermal properties of obtained PURs were investigated by thermogravimetry analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. The degree of crystallinity of polyol in soft segment of PURs was examined by using the X-ray diffraction (XRD), the morphology of the PURs was visualized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the structural modifications was analyzed by using FTIR spectroscopy. The XRD patterns revealed that the crystallinity decreased mainly due to the cross-linking process, and FTIR assignments confirmed the formation of ure-thane linkages. The thermal stabilities of two series of PURs have been correlated with their soft segment molecular weights, structure of cross-linker and NCO/OH molar ratio. The increase in isocyanate ratio increased the cross-linking and ther-mal stability of the PURs network. The increase in melting point is attributed to an increase in the size of the crystallites or an increase in complete crystalline phase due to the greater phase separation of the hard and soft segments. The results of the SEM micrographs showed that βCD contributes to the microphase separation. By using a various cyclodextrins as a cross-linker, the chain length of the soft segments and NCO/OH molar ratio, the stated properties of PURs have been changed.', 'Abstract', 'Keywords Cyclodextrin · Polyethylene glycol · Polyurethane · Microphase separation · Thermal analysis', 'Introduction', 'Polyurethanes (PURs) are an important group of materials which have biomedi-cal applications such as tissue engineering, orthopaedic implants, transdermal patches and drug delivery carriers. To polyols and isocyanates as the main raw materials for the production of PURs, additives called the chain extenders with a low molecular weight could be added, and they can have a great impact on their final properties [1–3]. Polyurethanes are made through the reaction of polyols, which form the soft or flexible segments, and diisocyanates and chain extenders, which form the hard or rigid segments. From these segments, the microdomain structure (mircophase-separated microstructure) is formed, and the primary driv-ing force for its formation is the immiscibility between the soft and hard seg-ments with high molecular weights. The formation of microdomain structure depends on their nature and chemical compositions of soft and hard segments. In the PURs with microdomain structure, the hard segments make a reservoir, and soft transport channels which regulate the release of a drug.', 'The critical factors, which can influence the microphase separation in PURs, include crystallization of the hard or soft segments, as well as the nature and strength of the intermolecular interactions (especially the competitive hydro-gen bonding) between segments, and hard/soft segment lengths and ratios in the copolymers. For example, the hydrogen bonding between urethane–urethane and urea–urea improves the microphase separation, while hydrogen bonding between urethane (or urea) and ether (or ester) groups in the soft segments favours phase mixing [4]. The kinetics of swelling and the sorption performance were observed by Renuka and Sonal [2] for the interpenetrating polymer networks of PURs. They are synthesized biodegradable PURs by using carbohydrates such as glu-cose (monosaccharide), sucrose (disaccharide) or starch (polysaccharide) as cross-linker and by varying the NCO/OH and diol/triol/ molar ratios.', 'Having in mind the protection of the environment and structural compatibility, carbohydrates have been used in many studies as additives for PURs [5–9]. The additives with higher functionality are called cross-linkers, and it is believed that carbohydrates/cross-linkers as chain extenders can form stronger hydrogen bonds within polymer; thus, extent of phase separation depends on the structure of a cross-linker and the content and nature of soft and hard segment [10, 11]. Natural car-bohydrates such as starch, cellulose, chitosan and alginate are increasingly used as biomaterials, due to their wide availability from renewable sources, non-toxicity, biodegradability and biocompatibility. The lack of good thermal properties, poor solubility and difficult processing are serious limitations of these materials when they are used alone, but the inclusion of carbohydrates in the structure of PURs can result in obtaining biodegradable materials with synergistic properties and improved mechanical and thermal properties [9]. The compounds of a large molecular weight such as cyclodextrins (CDs), a family of cyclic oligosaccharides of a glucopyranose [12], attract less attention, but they have higher functionality.', 'Today, PURs are increasingly used as carriers of drugs for medical purposes[13]. One of the main advantages of PURs for this application is their flexible chemical structure, and simple modification of the stoichiometry materials used for the PURs synthesis can result in a significant change in the properties of the final polymer [14]. Solanki et al. [8] concluded that the release rate of the active substance is directly proportional to the polyol/cross-linker and polyol/chain extender ratio and inversely proportional to the NCO/OH molar ratio. These results showed that by control of the structural design of the PURs, the control of drug release from the polyurethane matrix can be achieved.', 'Covalent polymer networks composed of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and cyclo-dextrins (CD) are particularly interesting for combining the hydrophilicity and flex-ibility of PEG chains with the capacity of cyclodextrins to encapsulate active princi-ples. Excellent properties of these materials recommend them for applications such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, coatings, solid–solid phase-changing materials, etc. [5–9].', 'The aim of the present work is to use a polyol with different molecular weights (BLOCK 1100, PEG 2000 and PEG 6000) and β-cyclodextrin (βCD) or hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) as cross-linkers, by varying the NCO/OH molar ratio in PURs as means to change their properties. To clarify the cross-linking effect of two kinds of cyclodextrins on PURs, no chain extender is used in order to avoid the synergy effect of chain extender and cyclodextrins. The NCO/OH molar ratio was varied with the aim to study the effect of cross-linking of cyclodextrins (as molecule of high weight) on PURs with various kinds of polyols. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report describing the influence of the chain length of the polyol component, cyclodextrins as cross-linkers and NCO/OH molar ratio on the properties of PURs as potential carriers of medicinal substances.', 'Experimental', 'Materials', 'Polyethylene glycols (mass average molecular weight, Mw=2000, 6000 g·mol−1, PEG2000, PEG6000) and poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) ( Mw=1100 g·mol−1, BLOCK 1100), obtained from Sigma Aldrich, were dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 12 h before being used as polyols. β-cyclodextrin ( Mw=1135 g·mol−1, βCD, purchased from Aldrich) and hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin ( Mw=1540 g·mol−1, HPβCD, purchased from Acros Organics) were used as received.

When the molecular weights of soft polyol segments increase from 1100 to 6000 g·mol−1, the reduction in the degree of connectivity between the hard and soft segments is expected to facili-tate the phase separation process, as well as crystallization of soft or hard seg-ments [23, 24].', 'It can be suggested that the presence of a cyclodextrin in polyurethane systems suppresses the crystallization of both soft and hard segments of a polyurethane matrix, in particular, due to its branched structure.', 'The results of values of the degree of crystallinity, χc, determined from WAXSspectra are presented in Table 2.', 'Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)', 'The effect of polyol structure on the stability of both series of PURs in a nitrogen atmosphere is illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5.

From the TGA curves, it was found that degradation was comparatively slow in the cross-linked polyurethane polymers, indicating that they are reasonably stable up to their melting points.', 'The initial degradation depends on the hard segments structure and the urethane linkage degraded first at 220−330 °C; the second step of degradation is associated with the soft segment degradation which started at above 350 °C [15].', 'In the case of degradation in a nitrogen atmosphere, phase separation favours the thermal stability of PURs after the dissociation of interurethane hydrogen bonding at a higher decomposition temperature. It means that a higher thermal stability cor-relates with a higher degree of phase separation.', 'It seems that the presence of the methyl group side of HPβCD is detrimental to the phase separation and hence reduces the extent of interurethane hydrogen bond-ing, as is evident from Fig. 4a and b. The series of PURs based on HPβCD displayed similar degradation profiles, suggesting that changes in soft segment molecular weight (BLOCK1100, PEG2000, PEG 6000) and NCO/OH ratio affect to a slight increase in thermal stability (decomposition temperatures rises from 280.75 and 289.92 to 292.50 °C) with increasing the NCO/OH molar ratio (i.e. isocyanate con-tent) [25].', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Figure 5 shows the degradation profile of PURs based on βCD with varia-tion in molecular weight and structure soft segment. TGA curves clearly show that sample PUR/PEG6000/βCD is more stable than PUR/PEG2000/βCD and PUR/BLOCK1100/βCD. This may be attributed to the fact that all interurethane hydrogen bonds for PUR/PEG6000/βCD dissociated at higher onset decomposi-tion temperatures (266.86 °C), possibly due to an increase in isocyanate content (NCO/OH of 6.3), the size of soft segment crystallites and increasing phase sepa-ration [26].', 'Generally, increase in isocyanate content (increase in the NCO/OH molar ratio from 3.3 and 4.3 to 6.3) increases the cross-linking and thermal stability of PURs based on βCD, such as decomposition temperatures rise from 228.51 and 236.4 to 266.86 °C, in order: PUR/BLOCK1100/βCD(HPβCD) < PUR/PEG2000/βCD(HPβCD) < PUR/PEG6000/βCD(HPβCD), respectively [2, 5].', '@', '@', 'Nevertheless, first weight loss maximum of PUR/PEG6000/βCD (317.38 °C) is a higher than of PUR/PEG2000/βCD (273.34 °C) and PUR/BLOCK1100/βCD (265.91 °C).', 'Therefore, the presence βCD in hard segments can increase the stability of the soft segment, while the soft segment may have a protection function on the hard segment and hence increase the stability of segmented PURs. The above facts can be interpreted as the mutual stabilization effect of segmented PURs. By combining the above results, it is generally concluded that the degree of phase separation has a tremendous effect on the thermal stability of polyurethane copolymers and there is a mutual stabilization effect between the soft and hard segments [25].', 'It appears that PUR/PEG6000/βCD has a higher mutual stabilization effect in second step of degradation (with a maxim centred at 415.55 °C) than samples from the same series of PURs based on polyols with a smaller molecular weight.', 'The TGA curves for both series of PURs in a nitrogen stream showed that the thermal stabilities are generally following degrees of interurethane hydrogen bonding.', 'Based on the literature searched, the sorption kinetics of synthesized biodegrada-ble PURs with carbohydrate as cross-linker depends on the type of carbohydrate and the NCO/OH molar ratio [2, 5, 7]. According to obtained results of thermal analysis, considering the effect of isocyanate content with carbohydrate as cross-linkers, it is expected the synthesized PURs will have as longer drug releasing as the degree of cross-linking is higher.', 'DSC analysis', 'The thermal transition properties of the PU-CD networks showed the exothermic peaks of crystalline phase were observed at 236.14 °C for PUR/PEG2000/HPβCD and 236.39 °C for PUR/PEG6000/HPβCD. In addition, endothermic peaks of melt-ing of soft segment were also observed in cross-linked polyurethanes based on HPβCD at 251.82 oC, 278.61 oC and 260.84 as shown in Fig. 6. The increase in melting point is attributed to an increase in the size of the crystallites or an increase in the complete crystalline phase [27, 28]. As the molecular weight of used polyol increases, the endothermic peak of melting of hard segments for PUR/BLOCK1100/HPβCD, PUR/PEG2000/HPβCD, PUR/PEG6000/HPβCD increases slightly to 296.13 °C, 313,36 °C and 311.41 °C, respectively.

Differ from common low molec-ular weight cross-linkers, the β-cyclodextrin (βCD) or hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) influenced the cross-link effect and therefore on the thermal properties too. Use of a polyol with higher molecular weight led to βCD (HPβCD)-based PURs with improved thermal stability. The TGA results showed the thermal stability of cross-linked PURs increased by increasing the NCO/OH molar ratio, because the increased cross-link densities promote formation of strong network. DSC analyses showed that by increasing the molecular weight of used polyol, the peak of melt-ing of soft and hard segments in both series (based on βCD and HPβCD) of PURs slightly increased. Based on XRD analysis, it can be seen the degree of crystalline of both PURs series was approximately the same and slightly increasing with the length of the polyol chains of soft segments. The length polyol in the soft segment and structure of cross-linker had a significant influence on degree of microphase separation in the soft and hard segment and crystallization behaviour of the materi-als. The SEM results proved the existence of βCD in the molecular structure which contributes to the phase separation.', 'The results support the use of cross-linked polyurethane networks based on CDs and PEGs as drug release carrier. By combination of polyols and carbohydrates, good properties of PURs can be achieved and further can be adjusted to various pur-poses by varying the NCO/OH molar ratio, type of polyol and cross-linker. Synthe-sized PURs are biodegradable and can serve as carriers for various drugs and thus contribute to the goals of the sustainable development, such as cleaner environment and healthy population. The study of drug release from these PURs shall be carried out in near future.', 'Acknowledgements The authors acknowledge the financial support of the Ministry of Science, Tech-nological Development and Innovation of the Republic of Serbia (Grant No. 451-03-65/2024-03/ 200133 and 451-03-65/2024-03/200134).', 'Author contribution S.C. involved in conceptualization, investigation, writing, I.R. took part in project administration, DSC analysis, H.B. took part in TG analysis, V.N. involved in methodology, N.N. par-ticipated in writing—review, S.R. involved in X-ray analysis, and S.

The PU prepolymer is a reaction product of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and a pentamethylene diisocyanate trimer (PDI-t). Furfuryl amine was attached to the terminal isocyanic groups of PU, resulting in furfuryl amine polyurethane (PU-FA). PU-FA was cross-linked via dynamic bonds between the furan groups and BMI, generating reversible bonds with the material. This study explored reversible polymer networks under various thermal conditions, including different reaction parameters, prepolymer ratios, and healing temperatures, to evaluate the healing capabilities of these polymers. The results demonstrated that PU-DA exhibits thermal reversibility, as evidenced by the appearance of an endothermic peak in the DSC analysis, indicating bond cleavage via the retro-Diels–Alder (r-DA) reaction. This endothermic peak re-emerged after cooling at 70 °C for 24 h, further confirming the reversibility of the reac-tion. Additionally, crack healing in the PU-DA film was facilitated by the synergistic effects of the thermally reversible Diels–Alder reaction and the thermal mobility of molecular chains. The self-healing performance evaluation revealed that PU-DA samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 exhibited a reduction in tensile strength after healing compared to the original PU-DA specimens before heat treatment. Conversely, samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 demonstrated a healing efficiency exceeding 100%, attributed to the enhanced cross-link density, which contributed to a more robust network structure.', '@', '@', "In this study, self-healing Diels-Alder polyurethane (PU-DA) was successfully synthesized using PDI trimer. The findings confirmed that the material's healing mechanism is activated by the reversible interaction between furan and maleimide groups within PU-DA, enabling it to autonomously repair structural damage", 'Keywords Polyurethane · Prepolymer · Self-healing · Pentamethylene diisocyanate trimer · Diels–Alder', '1 Introduction', 'Polyurethane has profoundly improved the quality of modern life through its diverse applications across multiple industries. It is integral in enhancing the performance and functionality of products in sectors, such as coatings, automotive, textiles, synthetic leather, electronics, construction materials, aerospace, and medicine. This versatile material not only improves the durability and efficiency of these products but also contributes to advances in technology and quality of life [1–4]. In practical applications, polyurethane is susceptible to the development of small cracks due to factors, such as heat, mechanical stress, and exposure to chemicals. These microcracks can significantly reduce the service life of polyurethane and are often challenging to detect visually [5]. Inspired by the self-repair mechanisms observed in nature, scientists have engineered polymers with inherent self-healing capabilities within certain limits. Self-healing strategies can be broadly categorized as extrinsic or intrinsic [6]. Extrinsic self-healing involves the incorporation of a healing agent within a polymer matrix; however, this method lacks reusability, because the healing agent is depleted upon each use. With this method, no external stimuli are needed for healing to occur. Conversely, the intrinsic self-healing system enables repetitive healing across multiple cycles of damage, although most methods in this system require external stimuli to initiate the healing process. As a result, intrinsic self-healing materials have attracted increasing attention in recent years [7].', 'Intrinsic self-healing materials normally contain dynamic bonds or interactions that can be broken and reformed to heal the material. These bonds can be covalent or nonco-valent in nature. Covalent bonds are often used because of their high strength of the bonds. Some examples of these bonds are Diels–Alder, disulfide, radical interactions, and cyclic compounds [8, 9]. Numerous studies have been conducted to develop self-healing polyurethanes with Diels–Alder chemistry. Self-healing polyurethanes (SH-PU) via the Diels–Alder method mostly comprise isocyanic polyurethane (to differ from nonisocyanic polyurethane) and commonly employ two main approaches. The first method involves the incorporation of furan terminals into the PU prepolymer, which are subsequently crosslinked with bis-maleimide (BMI). The second method involves the prepa-ration of a PU prepolymer containing maleimide pendant groups, which consequently react with difunctional furan compounds to produce SH-PU [5].', 'For isocyanates, researchers prefer the use of aliphatic isocyanate trimers for polyurethane coatings, because they offer lower toxicity, enhanced thermal stability, superior mechanical properties, and increased weather resistance [10]. The use of isocyanate trimers in the synthesis of self-healing polyurethane via the Diels–Alder system is wide-spread among researchers, with isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) trimers being the most commonly used [11–13]. IPDI is a cycloaliphatic isocyanate with one ring structure, whereas the IPDI trimer comprises a structure with four rings. These rings make the obtained polyurethane more rigid than when the diisocyanate is fully aliphatic, while more flexible materials are needed. To fill this gap, the entirely aliphatic hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and its trimers (HDI-t) were used. Researchers have used HDI-t to fabricate self-healing polymers [14–22]. To answer the demand for greener materials, the bio-based pentamethyl-ene diisocyanate and its trimer are already available in the market. Some researchers have employed pentamethylene diisocyanate trimers (PDI-t) in the synthesis of functional polyurethanes [23–25]. Most studies on self-healing polyu-rethanes primarily use the conventional isocyanates derived from fossil resources, such as 1,6-diisocyanatohexane (HDI), which does not align with the growing demand for more environmentally sustainable and eco-friendly materials [26, 27]. Despite its promising potential to improve cross-linking density and mechanical properties, the use of PDI-trimer derived from bio-based sources as an isocyanate has not been widely explored. In this study, we investigated the self-healing synthesis of PDI-trimer as an isocyanate through the Diels–Alder reaction method, focusing on the impact of the NCO/OH ratio on its thermal behavior, healing efficiency, and mechanical performance. A series of PU prepolymer formulations were synthesized from polyethylene glycol (PEG) and PDI-trimer (PDI-t) at different reaction times, temperatures, and NCO/OH ratios. These prepolymers were then reacted with furfuryl amine (FA) to yield PU-FA. Addi-tionally, self-healing polyurethane (SH-PU) was synthesized by cross-linking PU-FA with bismaleimide (BMI) via the Diels–Alder reaction. These experiments were performed to understand how the different synthesis conditions affect the mechanical properties and healing behavior of the end polymer products. The knowledge is expected to contribute to the development of green polyurethane, particularly for coating application.', '2 \x07Experimental', '2.1 \x07Materials', "Furfurylamine (99%, FA), 1,1'-(methylenedi-4,1-phenylene) bismaleimide (BMI), polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG), and dibutyltin dilaurate (95%, DBTDL) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Before polymerization, polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG) with a molecular weight of 4000 g/mol was dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 2 h. The isocyanate trimer Desmodur® eco N7300 (pentamethylene diisocy-anate/PDI-t), with an NCO content of 21.9% and an equiva-lent weight of 195, was sourced directly from PT Covestro Indonesia without further purification. Dimethylformamide (DMF), which was used as the solvent in the procedure, was purchased from Merck. Polyurethane with a furan terminal (PU-FA) and self-healing polyurethane (PU-DA) were syn-thesized as described in the previous studies [11, 28]. The synthesis details are described in the supporting information. FTIR spectroscopy spectra were acquired using a Brucker Tensor 27 spectrometer via the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) method, which uses 64 scans with a resolution of 4 \xadcm − 1 in transmittance mode in the wavenumber range of 4000–500 \xadcm − 1. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis was conducted using a Bruker Avance Neo 700 MHz NMR spectrophotometer with DMSO-d6 and \xadCDCl3 as solvents. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of PU-furan and PU-DA was performed using a Linseis STA instrument (STA PT1600) under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 °C min1 from 30 to 900 °C. The thermal behavior of PU-DA was assessed via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) using a Perkin Elmer DSC 8000 instru-ment in the temperature range of 0–190 °C. The heating and cooling rates were 20 °C/min, and all experiments were conducted under a protective nitrogen atmosphere. The melting temperature \xad(Tm) and entropy of fusion (ΔHm) data were collected during the second heating run. The density of the crosslinked polyurethanes (PUs) was determined using a pycnometer with distilled water as the immersion liquid. To assess the crosslink density of the samples, the degree of swelling, and gel content, the samples were measured. Samples 10 × 10x0.3 mm in size were immersed in 10 mL of toluene at room temperature in sealed containers for 24 h. Afterward, the film was washed with toluene and weighed to determine its mass \xad(ms). The films were subsequently sub-jected to drying at 35 °C initially under atmospheric pressure and then under vacuum, after which the weight of the dried film \xad(md) was recorded. The degree of swelling (Q) and gel content (G) were calculated using Eqs. (1) and (2) [29, 30]", '2.2 \x07Characterization', 'Q = 1 + 휌1휌2( msmd −1).', 'Furthermore', 'G(%) = mdmiso × 100.', 'Here, ρ1 and ρ2 represent the densities of the solvent (tol-uene, ρ: 0.8669 g/cm3) and the PU polymer, respectively. The variable md corresponds to the post-extraction weight of the dried sample post-extraction, whereas \xadmiso denotes the isolated weight of the sample before the extraction process.', 'The self-healing capability of PU-DA was qualitatively assessed using a Hirox KH-7700 digital microscope to observe the mending process of cracks induced by blades on the sample surfaces. The sheet samples were intentionally scratched at a depth of 0.5 mm and then subjected to five dif-ferent heating treatments to observe their self-healing ability. The treatments involved heating at temperatures of 100 °C, 110 °C, 120 °C, and 130 °C for 10 min, heating at 130 °C for 2 h, and cooling at 70 °C for 24 h. A quantitative study was conducted to evaluate the recovery of tensile strength following the self-healing process, utilizing a universal test-ing machine (Shimadzu AG–X Plus 50 kN). PU-DA samples were prepared as specimens according to ASTM D638 type 4, which were scratched in the center with a knife blade measuring 1 cm in length and 1 mm in depth. The self-healing process was then performed by heating the samples at 130 °C for 2 h, followed by a 24-h period at 70 °C. The self-healing efficiency was calculated based on the recovery of tensile strength using Eq. (3)', 'Healing Efficiency (% ) = Tensile strength healedTensile strength original × 100%. The synthesis pathway of PU-DA is depicted in Fig. 1, and the reaction conditions are explained in Table 1. Initially, PEG was reacted with an excess PDI-trimer to obtain a prepolymer with isocyanates as the terminal functional groups. Because of the different reaction conditions applied during this step, the prepolymers were assumed to possess different properties, as observed during the reaction. The prepolymer was subsequently reacted with furfuryl amine (FA), resulting in the formation of furan-terminated polyurethane (PU-FA). The final product polyurethane Diels–Alder (PU-DA) was obtained through the Diels–Alder reaction between PU-FA and bismaleimide (BMI) at 80 °C, followed by solvent evaporation at 60 °C under vacuum. Structural analysis of polyethylene glycol (PEG), the PDI-trimer, PU-FA, and PU-DA was performed using 1H-NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 2).', '3 \x07Results and discussion', '3.1 \x07Synthesis of polyurethane Diels–Alder (PU‑DA)', 'The NMR spectrum of PU-FA (Fig. 2c) reveals the suc-cessful synthesis of the PU prepolymer and the subsequent incorporation of the furan group. The PU prepolymer struc-ture is revealed by the emergence of a carbamate bond (NH‒COO) peak at 3.41 ppm (c). The furan group attached to the prepolymer is distinguished by the presence of distinct furan ring peaks at 6.18 ppm (m), 6.37 ppm (n), and 7.55 ppm (o). Additionally, an amide group, which indicates the urethane or urea proton NH, was observed at 5.90 ppm (d, k). Further-more, the product of the PU-FA and BMI reactions (Fig. 2d), a Diels–Alder adduct, is characterized by notable proton shifts at 3.07 ppm (r), 5.18 ppm (q), and 6.42–6.59 ppm (p). The aromatic structure of BMI is indicated by peaks in the range of 7.26–7.35 ppm (s, t). Additionally, the characteris-tic methylene peak originating from BMI was identified at 3.9 ppm (u).', '@', '@', "The formation of the polyurethane prepolymer from the reaction between polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the pentamethylene diisocyanate (PDI) trimer was confirmed through FTIR spectroscopy, as depicted in Fig. 3 and S1. The FTIR spectrum reveals a characteristic absorption peak at 2270 cm⁻1, which corresponds to the stretching vibration of the isocyanate (NCO) group. This distinct peak serves as a definitive indicator of the presence of the polyurethane prepolymer and remains detectable throughout the progression of the reaction, providing consistent evidence of the NCO group's role in the synthesis process. The ATR-FTIR spectra shown in Fig. 3 for the PU prepolymer, PU-FA, and PU-DA support the findings of the 1H NMR analysis. The lack of a peak at 2270 cm⁻1 in PU-FA confirms that the isocyanate group has reacted, indicating no residual isocyanate group remains. In contrast, the emergence of peaks at 1012, 736, and 811 \xadcm−1 distinctly confirms the incorporation of a furan ring in PU–FA [31, 32]. Compared with PU-FA, PU-DA has an obvious shoulder peak at 1710 \xadcm−1, which is characteristic of the DA adduct (–C = O band of imide) [33]. Simultaneously, the intensity decreases at 1012, 811, and 736 \xadcm−1, stemming from the consumption of the furan ring by the BMI molecule (Fig. 3b). This reduction clearly indicates the success of the PU–FA reaction with BMI through the Diels–Alder reaction.", '@', '@ DSC analyses of both the pristine PEG and PU-DA formulations were carried out over a temperature range of 0 °C to 190 °C. Figure 4a shows the DSC curve of pristine PEG, which shows distinct melting and crystallization peaks at 61.1 °C and 21.5 °C, respectively. In contrast, Fig. 4b shows that the endothermic peak (melting temperature) of PU-DA is generally lower than that of pristine PEG (61.1 °C). This difference results from the hindrance of multiple PEG crystalline segments as they interact during the formation of Diels–Alder cross-links, restricting their ability to organize into a well-defined crystalline structure. [34]. The cooling DSC curve (Fig. 4c) shows the reformation of PEG characterized by an exothermic peak. Owing to the inhibition of chain mobility by Diels–Alder crosslinks, PU-DA formulations tend to display higher crystallization temperatures than pristine PEG, indicating that recrystallization occurred earlier during cooling. Figure 4d shows the first and second heating–cooling cycles in the DSC thermogram of PU-DA formula 6. In the first heating cycle (black line), the thermogram of PU shows a modest endothermic peak between 110 and 150 °C, indicating the occurrence of a retro-DA reaction (release of furan and maleimide group bonds) [35]. Moreover, in the cooling curve (red line), a small exothermic peak at approximately 72 °C (as clearly shown in the inset photograph) suggests', '3.2 \x07Thermal characteristics and reversibility of Diels–Alder (DA) bonds the reformation of DA adduct bonds, which are possibly obscured by PEG recrystallization. Meanwhile, during the second heating cycle (blue line), the absence of the endothermic peak can be attributed to the insufficient interval between the two cycles, which prevented the complete reconstruction of the DA bonds. This inadequacy led to the peak not being discernible by DSC during the second heating cycle [36, 37].', 'In Table 2, the melting enthalpies of the eight polyu-rethane Diels–Alder (PU-DA) formulations ranged from 25.5 to 134.5 J/g, while the crystallization enthalpies (ΔHc) ranged from 26.2 to 136.8 J/g. Compared to pristine PEG (ΔHm = 158.3 J/g, ΔHc = 137.0 J/g), the PU-DA formulation exhibits a lower melting and crystallization enthalpy, sug-gesting that the crystallization and melting of PEG segments are hindered. This reduction is attributed to the restricted molecular mobility imposed by Diels–Alder cross-linking, which limits the ability of PEG chains to organize into a well-defined crystalline structure [38]. The synthesis of PU-DA involved NCO/OH ratios of 1.5 and 3. Notably, the data in Table 2 indicate that an NCO/OH ratio of 3 resulted in lower melting and crystallization enthalpies than an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5. This difference may stem from the higher NCO/OH ratio, which intensifies the disruption of PEG crystalline segments as a result of increased Diels–Alder cross-link formation. Consequently, the restricted molecular mobility leads to lower melting and crystallization enthalp-ies compared to the sample with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5. This is further evidenced by the NCO/OH ratio of 3, which corresponds to a higher gel content value compared to the ratio of 1.5.', 'One advantage of intrinsic self-healing materials lies in the repeatability of their healing process, which stems from the reversibility of dynamic bonds. The thermal reversibility of Diels–Alder bonds further elucidate this mechanism. The thermal treatment of the PU-DA samples (Fig. 5a) and subsequent DSC measurements with consistent parameters revealed significant insights. In Fig. 5b, the observed peak (38–60 °C) indicates the melting of PEG crystals within the Diels–Alder polyurethane matrix. The thermograms also revealed modest endothermic peaks, indicating the breakage of DA adducts from the original polymer synthesis', '@', '@ process (DA1) at 120 °C (sample F5-PUDA) and 140 °C (F6-PUDA). After heat treatment and cooling at 70 °C, DSC observations (Fig. 5c and Table S2) revealed decreased melting and crystallization enthalpies of PEG in DA2 compared with those in DA1, which was attributed to the presence of DA2 bonds hindering the mobility of the PEG crystalline segments [39]. The decrease in enthalpies indicates Diels–Alder bond reconstruction during heating at 70 °C for 24 h. This phenomenon confirmed the reproducible thermal reversibility of the synthesized PU-DA samples.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Tm and \xadTc represent the melting/crystallization temperature, respectively; ΔHm and ΔHc represent the melt-ing/crystallization enthalpy, respectively, and the density (ρ), degree of swelling (Q), and gel content (G) were measured experimentally', '@', '@', 'Figure 6 shows the TGA and DTG curves of the Diels–Alder polyurethane sample under consistent heating conditions. The DTG curve reveals two distinct stages of thermal decomposition, marked by a minor peak in the initial stage and a substantial mass loss in the subsequent stage. The observed minor peak at approximately 160 °C likely arises from the evaporation of residual DMF within the material [40]. While the TGA curves of the PU-DA series are similar, the polyurethane samples F2 and F8 exhibit lower thermal stability, which can be related to their lower gel contents. In this sample, the rapid formation of the PU prepolymer restricts the extent to which furan groups can react with the prepolymer. Consequently, furan groups face challenges in integrating into the maleimide structure, leading to decreased formation of Diels–Alder crosslinks.', '3.3 \x07Healing ability', 'The self-healing behaviors of the eight PU-DA samples were comprehensively assessed using qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The qualitative evaluation involved a scratch test to visually assess the material’s healing capacity, whereas quantitative analysis was performed by determining the percentage of healing efficiency via hardness measurements. To qualitatively explore the healing process, the PU-DA film samples were subjected to five distinct heating treatments. The four treatments included heating the samples at temperatures ranging from 100 to 130 °C for 10 min each, followed by cooling to ambient temperature. The fifth treatment consisted of heating the sample at 130 °C for 2 h to promote the retro-Diels–Alder reaction, followed by heating at 70 °C for 24 h to facilitate the Diels–Alder reaction. The outcomes were evaluated using a digital microscope set at 100 × magnification. The results of the four thermal treatments are shown in Figure S2-S3, and the results of the fifth thermal treatment are shown in Fig. 8.', '@', '@', 'Polyurethane chains consist of soft segments derived from polyols and hard segments derived from isocyanates, with thermal energy influencing the mobility of these segments. Generally, soft segments exhibit greater mobility than hard segments upon heating, while hard segments restrict the thermal motion of molecular chains. Consequently, the self-healing capability of PU-DA is significantly influenced by the ratio of soft-to-hard segments, which can be controlled by adjusting the NCO/OH molar ratio. Observations from optical microscopy (Fig. 7) of the healing test conducted at 100 °C indicate that samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 (formulas F1–F4) exhibit faster scratch recovery compared to those with a ratio of 3 (formulas F5–F8). Similar trends were observed at 110, 120, and 130 °C (Figure S2.I-II and S3.III-IV), where samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 demonstrated superior healing efficiency. This phenomenon can be attributed to the higher proportion of soft segments in the 1.5 ratio, which enhances the mobility of the PU chains, allowing PU-FA and BMI to reflow and fill cracks after heat treatment. Conversely, samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 contain fewer soft segments, restricting polymer chain mobility and impeding the healing process [41].', '@', '@', '@', '@', "The thermally induced self-healing property of PU-DA is linked to the dissociation and reformation of Diels–Alder (DA) bonds. The images below illustrate the response of the PU-DA samples to various temperature treatments, confirm-ing the reconstruction of the DA bonds in the crosslinked network under thermal stimulation. PU-DA film samples etched at the same position were heated at temperatures ranging from 100 to 130 °C for 10 min each. At 100 °C, most scratches remained visible, although slight healing at the scratch base was observed (Figure S2.I). At 110 °C, some PU-DA samples exhibited increased healing, although small scars from incomplete healing were still present (Fig-ure S2.II). Treatments at 120 °C and 130 °C (Figures S3. III-IV) resulted in significantly better healing responses than those at lower temperatures, with tightly closed cracks indi-cating a reversible reaction between the furan and maleimide groups on the PU-DA surface [34]. Wool and O'Connor’s theory posits that the polymer chain diffusion rate is cru-cial in controlling the healing speed during the crack heal-ing process [42]. The temperature significantly affected the diffusion rate. When heated, the scratched surface deforms back to its original position, bringing the separated surfaces into contact. Simultaneously, the retro-DA reaction acceler-ates chain interdiffusion between the crack surfaces after clo-sure, leading to successful healing [43]. The scratches on the PU-PA film disappeared completely after heating to 130 °C for 2 h (Figure S3). This heating caused fluidization, which facilitated self-healing of the damaged area. Upon cooling to 70 °C, rebonding occurred, leading to the reconstruction of the Diels–Alder cross-linked network [44].", 'The quantitative evaluation of self-healing was conducted by measuring the recovery of tensile strength using a univer-sal testing machine (Shimadzu AG–X Plus 50kN). PU-DA samples were prepared by casting polymer films from a DMF solution, with dimensions of 17 cm in length, 16 cm in width, and a thickness ranging from 0.5 to 1 mm. The films were then subjected to solvent evaporation at 65 °C for 24 h. Specimens were prepared by punching the films according to the ASTM D638 type 4 standard, followed by introducing a scratch measuring 1 cm in length and 1 mm in depth at the center using a knife blade. The self-healing process was performed by heating the specimens at 130 °C for 2 h, and then maintaining them at 70 °C for 24 h. The healing efficiency was quantified based on the recovery of tensile strength, calculated using Eq. (3).', 'In this study, the self-healing behavior of PU-DA samples was evaluated using formulations with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 for the F5-F8 samples and 1.5 for the F1-F4 samples. Figure 8b presents the representative stress–strain curves of the original and healed PU-DA samples after being scratched. The corresponding values of tensile strength, elongation at break, and elastic modulus are shown in Fig. 8c–8e. The results from the tensile strength and elongation at break tests (Fig. 8c and 8d) indicate a distinct trend in healing performance, samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 exhibited a reduction in tensile strength and elongation at break after healing, whereas those with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 showed an increase in both properties following the healing process. Furthermore, the elastic modulus (Fig. 8e) increased in all PU-DA samples, regardless of the NCO/OH ratio. The evaluation of self-healing performance in PU-DA samples revealed distinct differences in mechanical properties depending on the NCO/OH ratio used during synthesis. Specifically, PU-DA formulations with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 (Formulas F1–F5) exhibited a noticeable decline in tensile strength after the healing process when compared to PU-DA specimens that had not undergone thermal treatment. This reduction suggests that a lower cross-linking density may have limited the material’s ability to recover its original mechanical integrity. Conversely, PU-DA samples synthesized with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 (Formulas F5–F8) displayed a significant enhancement in healing efficiency, surpassing 100%. This remarkable self-healing capability is primarily attributed to the presence of a greater number of cross-links within the polymer network, which is directly correlated with the observed increase in gel content. The higher cross-link density not only facilitated more effective reformation of the molecular structure after damage but also contributed to improved tensile strength, exceeding that of the original PU-DA sample before healing. These findings highlight the critical role of cross-linking density in optimizing self-healing properties and mechanical robustness in thermally reversible polyurethane systems.', "The self-healing performance of PU-DA is governed by the synergistic effects of thermally induced polyurethane chain mobility and the thermo-reversible Diels–Alder (DA) reaction. Consequently, the self-healing capability of PU-DA is strongly influenced by the ratio of soft-to-hard segments, which can be controlled through the NCO/OH molar ratio. At an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5, the tensile strength after healing decreases compared to the original PU-DA sample (see Table 3). In contrast, when compared to a ratio of 3, both the pre- and post-healing tensile strength values are lower. This phenomenon can be attributed to the lower crosslink density, as indicated by the gel content, in PU-DA samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 compared to those with a ratio of 3 (see Fig. 9f and Table S3). The reduced crosslink density in the 1.5 ratio results in lower tensile strength relative to the 3.0 ratio. At a higher hard-segment content (i.e., an NCO/OH ratio of 3), the formation of additional crosslinks between hard segments enhances structural integrity, requiring more energy to disrupt the network [45]. Self-healing efficiency is influenced by the polymer chain's ability to diffuse across the crack area and the availability of broken cross-links for reformation. These two factors exhibit an inverse relationship: as the cross-link density increases, chain diffusion is hindered, leading to a higher number of broken cross-links. At lower cross-linking levels, mechanical strength decreases. This phenomenon explains why the self-healing efficiency of the PU-DA sample with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 is lower compared to the ratio of 3, where the gel content is higher. Additionally, self-healing values exceeding 100%, which are attributed to the presence of cross-links reflected in the gel content, result in higher tensile strength than the original PU-DA sample [46, 47].", '4 \x07Conclusions', 'The behavior of the isocyanate trimer (PDI-trimer) in the synthesis of self-healing polyurethane (PU-DA) via the Diels–Alder (DA) reaction was investigated through the reaction between the furan-terminated prepolymer and bismaleimide. Digital microscopy and DSC observations revealed that cracks with a depth of 0.5 mm in the PU-DA film could be repaired after heat treatment at 120–130 °C for 10 min, achieving complete healing at 130 °C for 10 min, followed by cooling at 70 °C for 24 h. The tightly closed cracks indicate a reversible reaction between the furan and maleimide groups on the surface of the PU-DA sample. Additionally, the DSC results revealed an endothermic peak in the PU-DA material (DA1), indicating the breakage of the Diels–Alder bond (r-DA). After cooling at 70 °C for 24 h, the endothermic peak remained visible (DA2), demonstrating the thermal reversibility of the synthesized PU-DA samples, which allows for repeated healing due to the reversibility of the Diels–Alder bond.', '@', '@', 'a A self-healing efficiency of 100% is attained when a PU-DA sample that undergoes a healing process—comprising heat treatment at 130 °C for 2 h followed by additional heating at 70 °C for 24 h—restores its tensile strength to the same level as the original, unhealed sample that has not undergone any thermal treatment. It is important to note that PU-DA1 refers to the pristine PU-DA sample, while PU-DA2 represents the healed PU-DA specimen', '@', '@', 'The NCO/OH ratio significantly influences the forma-tion of the furan‒maleimide crosslink bond structure. At a ratio of 3, the formation of PEG crystals is smaller than that at a ratio of 1.5, indicating that a higher ratio leads to more crosslink bonds and a decrease in the melting enthalpy value in DSC measurements. The healing efficiency of PU-DA samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 (Formulas F1-F5) showed a reduction in tensile strength compared to the unheated PU-DA specimens. In contrast, PU-DA sam-ples with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 (Formulas F5-F8) dem-onstrated enhanced healing efficiency, exceeding 100%, which can be attributed to the higher density of cross-links. This increased cross-linking, as reflected in the gel content, resulted in greater tensile strength than the original PU-DA sample.

The rheological, thermal, and cross-linking properties of CSM rubber under various sulfur curing processes are used to correlates its curing behavior with the network characteristics. Employing advanced analytical techniques such as rheometery, differential scanning calorimetry, and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, the formulations were evaluated containing magnesium oxide (MgO), pentaerythritol, sulfur, and accelerators like TMTD and MBTS. Among the studied formulations, the combination of pentaerythritol, MBTS, TMTD, and sulfur exhibited the most favorable curing dynamics, achieving the highest curing enthalpy (8.1 J/g) and vulcanization rate (0.42 dNm/min) while maintaining the lowest loss factor (tan δ = 0.07). The findings demonstrate a direct correlation between an enhanced cross-linking network and improved thermal stability, with the dehydrochlorination temperature reaching a peak value of 259 °C. Notably, the results highlight the dominance of metal oxide crosslink in the sulfur-free compound. Additionally, the analysis demonstrates that MgO and pentaerythritol cannot form active complexes and enhance the curing quality without the aid of accelerator and sulfur. These insights provide a comprehensive understanding of sulfur curing systems for CSM rubber and suggest pathways for tailoring its thermal and curing properties. The findings hold significant potential for advancing materials design in high-performance rubber applications.', 'Graphical abstract', '@', 'Keywords Chlorosulfonated polyethylene (CSM) rubber · Sulfur vulcanization · Rheological characteristics · Mechanism', 'Introduction', 'The synthesis of chlorosulfonated polyethylene (CSM) involves the chlorination and sulfochlorination of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) or high-density polyethylene (HDPE) [1]. In general, polyethylene with an approximate number average molecular weight of 20,000 is used to produce CSM. Typically, the polyethylene possesses one elongated branch for every 100 carbon atoms in the primary chain and two to four small branches for approximately every four carbon atoms. At a chlorine content of 30%, there are around 17 chlorine atoms for every 100 carbon atoms in the backbone [2, 3]. The physical and mechanical properties of rubber products vary based on cross-linking efficiency, which affects the performance of the product [4]. CSM undergoes vulcanization, and its saturated backbone enhances its resistance to heat, weathering, chemicals, and oil [5–7].', 'While researchers have extensively investigated CSM rubber curing, they have not thoroughly examined the sulfur curing mechanism of this rubber [8, 9]. Additionally, numerous methodologies have been devised to investigate the thermal properties and phase structure of CSM rubber [10, 11]. Nanda and Seleznev [4, 12] have extensively examined the curing mechanisms of CSM rubber, specifically discussing ionic and covalent curing in their research. Nanda has investigated four curing systems for CSM rubber: epoxy, metal oxide, peroxide, and sulfur, and subsequently proposed a distinct mechanism for each. Nersasian and Andersen [13] examined the physical and mechanical properties of chlorosulfonated polyethylene (CSM) vulcanizates cured using a system based on magnesium oxide (MgO), pentaerythritol, and accelerators, along with titanium compounds. Their findings revealed that this curing approach formed dense ionic crosslinked networks, leading to improved tensile strength, elasticity, and thermal stability.', 'CSM rubber provides two curing methods: ionic curing and covalent curing. Ionic curing involves moisture-accelerated ionic cross-linking and a divalent metal oxide acid acceptor. Covalent curing entails covalent cross-linking, frequently employed for CSM rubber [14–16]. Researchers always face the difficulty of adapting the curing technique for rubber composites to their individual applications. Therefore, their study focuses on using the suitable vulcanization agent in relation to precise values [17–20]. Roychoudhury et al. assessed the self-cross-linking characteristics of CSM and the chemical interactions between CSM and silica [21–23].', 'Sulfur vulcanizing agents can be used in conjunction with other activators or accelerators to enhance the desired physical properties, process safety, and curing rate [3]. Organic sulfur compounds, including accelerators and sulfur donors, are also parts of realistic vulcanization systems. In the presence of metal oxides, they generate covalent crosslinks with active chloride structures, which may involve sulfur [2]. Primary sulfur vulcanizing agents, accelerators that contain sulfur, peroxides (often in combination with coagents), and maleimides like N,N′-m-phenylene-dimaleimide (HVA-2). Various accelerators and coagents are used to accelerate the activation of the acid acceptor or the cross-linking activity of the primary curing agent. Sulfur and sulfur donors, such as TMTD, TETD, and DPTT, provide safe processing, low cost, and good overall properties as curing agents for both light and dark-colored CSM [5]. Mastromateo et al. [24] indicated that employing accelerators with greater solubility in CSM rubber can enhance curing compatibility.', 'Typically, cross-linking agents and activators are employed in conjunction with magnesium, lithium, and other substances to achieve an appropriate state of cure and curing rates. Acid acceptors fulfill two functions: They neutralize acids generated during vulcanization and serve as cross-linking agents [5]. Alam et al. [25] describe the interactions between zinc-based and non-zinc-based cross-linking accelerators in conjunction with MgO as a curing activator, aiming to identify an alternative to ZnO, an environmental pollutant, in the vulcanization of natural rubber. Therefore, in the absence of zinc oxide, vulcanization can fully utilize MgO, a more readily available and nontoxic alternative. They also found that MgO as a co-cure activator improved rubber vulcanization curing kinetics [26–28].', 'Pentaerythritol serves as a curing accelerator alongside magnesium, improving the curing rate and increasing the state of curing (SOC). The primary polyols solely function as activators and necessitate the presence of sulfur, sulfur donors, or alternative curing agents. Polyols can interact with litharge acid receptors, but the resulting scorch time is extremely short. These also increase water absorption. Experience indicates that pentaerythritol offers the optimal equilibrium among process safety, cost, and vulcanization characteristics [5, 13, 29].', 'This study offers a detailed sulfur curing mechanism of CSM rubber and investigates the interaction between magnesium oxide and pentaerythritol in forming ionic crosslinks and their thermal properties. Techniques such as rheometery, ATR-FTIR, and DSC were employed to elucidate some details of the sulfur vulcanization of CSM rubber by focusing on four distinct curing systems that incorporate varying combinations of magnesium oxide, pentaerythritol, sulfur, and accelerators. The formulations, which range from systems dominated by magnesium oxide to those containing pentaerythritol and traditional accelerators, enable a strategic evaluation of the individual contributions of each component. These findings pave the way for optimizing high-performance elastomeric formulations.', 'Experimental', 'Materials and methods', 'The chlorosulfonated polyethylene rubber (TS-530 brand) used in this study was supplied by TOSOH Co. (Japan), containing 35% chlorine and 1% sulfur (Table 1). Magnesium oxide (MAGOX Super Premium, USA) with a mesh size of 325 was provided by Premier Magnesia Co. Pentaerythritol (> 98% monomeric, 200 mesh) was sourced from J&H Chem Co. (China). The curing accelerators, 2-mercaptobenzothiazole disulfide (MBTS) and tetramethylthiuram disulfide (TMTD), were obtained from Shandong Sunsine Co. and Dingyuan Chemical Co. (China), respectively. The sulfur curing agent was procured from Partogoogerd Co. (Iran). Additional information about these additives is detailed in Table 2.', 'Subsequently, compounds were formulated and encoded according to Table 3 (all values are presented in phr) to investigate the influence of modifying different systems on the curing process of the compounds. Pentaerythritol, MBTS, and sulfur were incorporated as variables in these compounds, while MgO and TMTD were maintained as constants throughout the study.', 'The mixing process utilized the Brabender internal mixer, manufactured by the Polymer and Petrochemical Institute of Iran. The fill factor was 0.75, and the rotor speed was 60 rpm. The mixing temperature commenced at 70 °C, while the discharge temperature was maintained at 90 ± 5 °C. Following a 12-h period of rest, each blend was processed five times using the German-manufactured laboratory two-roll mill, the Schweanthan Polymix 200L. All blends were prepared utilizing the identical procedure, as detailed in Table 4.', 'Methods for characterization', 'Diverse standardized instruments and techniques were employed for the preparation,curing, and measurement of the samples.', 'Curing and viscoelastic characteristics', 'The MDR 3000 Pro from the German company MonTech was utilized for testing curing time and kinetics. The ASTM D5289 standard, analogous to the ISO 6502 standard, was employed to perform this test. This test was conducted at temperatures ranging from 150 to 170 °C, a frequency of 1.67 Hz, and a strain of 7%, corresponding to 0.5 degrees. The MDR rheometric test is used to determine the state of cure, optimal curing time, and scorch time. In order to determine rheometric mechanical properties like minimum torque ML, maximum torque MH, and torque increment (ΔM), calculated as (MH − ML), as well as kinetic parameters like scorch time TS2 (which takes into account a 2% increase in torque difference) and optimal curing time T90 (which takes into account a 90% increase in torque difference), this tool offers a torque versus time graph at a constant vulcanization temperature. The rate of vulcanization (RV) and the curing rate index (CRI) are derived from Eqs. 1 and 2, respectively [30–33]:', '@', '@', 'RV = (MT90−MTs2)∕(T90−Ts2)', 'CRI = 100 ∕(T90−Ts2)', 'The tool can also compute dynamic properties including shear modulus, loss factor (tan δ), and viscosity. The test was based on a time sweep at constant temperature, and the dynamic properties were reported at the time of maximum torque (MH) occurrence. Energy is dissipated by the rubber during impact. Characteristics that delineate the energy dissipation capability of the material are referred to as dynamic properties. The complex modulus G* is a complex quantity that can be separated into a real component, known as the storage modulus G′, and an imaginary component, referred to as the loss modulus G″. Their relationship is depicted in Eq. 3 [34].', 'G* = G�+ i G��', 'The storage modulus G′ indicates a material’s ability to store and release energy to the environment, while the loss modulus G″ reflects a material’s capacity to dissipate energy within its internal structure. An additional significant parameter derived from the dynamic time sweep test is tan δ. The loss factor tan δ, defined as the ratio of the loss or viscous modulus to the storage or elastic modulus, is associated with molecular motion [32, 35–37]. Equation 4 delineates the methodology for calculating the loss factor.', 'tan 훿= G��∕G�', 'The structure of the rubber is directly related to the parameter known as complex viscosity (η*).

The constant K in Eq. 5 denotes the quantification of flow resistance.', 'Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)', 'A thermal evaluation of the compounds and specific raw materials was conducted under an inert gas atmosphere using a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) apparatus. The analysis utilized a Netzsch DSC 200-F3 instrument (Germany), operated at a consistent heating rate of 10 °C/min over a temperature range of  −  100 to 300 °C. The heat flow difference between the sample pan containing the specimen and the empty reference pan was recorded as the temperature increased, generating DSC thermograms for analysis.', 'To ensure reliability and consistency, each heating cycle was performed under identical experimental conditions, with fresh samples of similar mass used for each run. The heat flow variations, recorded under a heating rate of 10 °C/min, were meticulously monitored and visualized as DSC thermograms. This test provided critical parameters such as the glass transition temperature (Tg), melting temperature (Tm), crystallization temperature (Tc), curing enthalpy (ΔHc), and dehydrochlorination temperature. These values were accurately determined using the Proteus analysis software integrated with the instrument, ensuring precisecharacterization of the thermal properties.', '@', '@', 'Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy—attenuated total reflectance (ATR‑FTIR)', 'The functional groups present in the compounds were analyzed using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy.

The objective of the analysis was to identify the characteristic absorption bands that correspond to the functional groups in the rubber matrix and additives. Chemical changes or interactions that resulted from the curing process were detected using the recorded spectra, which provided insight into the structural and compositional properties of the compounds.', 'Result and discussion', 'Curing and viscoelastic properties', 'The rheometric test for various CSM rubber compounds at temperatures ranging from 150 to 170 °C yielded torque variations over time represented as a curve. In this section’s analysis, only the curves derived from Fig. 1 at a temperature of 160 °C were utilized. The rheometric curve was limited to a duration of 100 min because the MTS1 compound exhibited the marching modulus phenomenon in the absence of pentaerythritol, allowing it to attain its maximum torque within this timeframe. The data obtained from this curve encompass maximum and minimum torques, scorch time, state of cure (SOC), ΔM, CRI, and RV, which are essential for ascertaining the curing parameters, as depicted in Fig. 2 and summarized in Table 5.', 'Table 5 indicates that the variations in torque, scorch time, and curing time differ for each compound. The scorch time TS2 is defined as the moment when the curing torque rises by two units relative to the minimum torque. This period, which is a function of temperature and comes just after the induction time, is when the rubber only experiences a physical change due to heating rather than any chemical change. Some references consider the induction time when the torque increases by one unit over the minimum torque [40–42]. The subsequent analysis examines the influence of temperature and blend content on curing behavior.', 'In Fig. 2a, the lack of pentaerythritol curing activator results in MTS1 exhibiting the longest scorch time (5.3 min), whereas the absence of the MBTS accelerator, due to its time delay, leads to PTS1 having the shortest scorch time (2.6 min) in comparison to PMTS1.', 'Figure 2b indicates that the MTS1 sample exhibits the longest curing time T90 at 42.4 min, attributable to the lack of pentaerythritol, while the PMTS0 sample demonstrates the shortest curing time at 15.0 min. The absence of sulfur in the compound, coupled with the presence of the accelerator TMTD, which functions as both a sulfur donor and an accelerator, eliminates the necessity for the accelerator to open the S8 ring during the curing reaction, resulting in a reduced curing time.', 'Figure 2c indicates that the MTS1 sample exhibits the highest torque of 9.6 (dNm), while the PMTS0 sample demonstrates the lowest torque of 5.2 (dNm). Figure 2d demonstrates that the highest torque increment, calculated from the difference between maximum and minimum torque (MH − ML), is associated with MTS1, yielding a value of 8.9 (dNm). This was achieved after approximately 100 min for this compound. The predominant portion is ascribed to the marching modulus of this compound. In order to prevent this phenomenon, as well as to ensure a flat curing rate and an appropriate state of cure for the compounds, major accelerators such as TMTD and the Thiuram family are typically important in controlling the marching of CSM rubber. An auxiliary accelerator such as MBTS, in conjunction with TMTD and sulfur, improves the safety of scorching and provides an optimal curing condition for CSM rubbers [3]. In contrast, the PMTS0 sample exhibits the lowest torque increment value of 4.5 (dNm), due to the lack of sulfur. The inclusion of TMTD, comprising roughly 13.3% active sulfur, facilitates ideal curing conditions for this compound. Sulfur donors may be utilized when a significant amount of sulfur cannot be incorporated into the compound. These materials are employed in high-temperature rubber vulcanization and in efficient (EV) and semi-efficient (SEV) vulcanization processes. Sulfur donors are utilized to establish a cross-linking network that resists degradation from thermal exposure. Typically, sulfur donors convert the initially formed polysulfide linkages into monosulfide, signifying EV or SEV systems [43]. Figure 2e reveals that the MTS1 sample has the lowest curing rate index at 2.7 (1/min), whereas the PMTS0 sample shows the highest at 8.6 (1/min). This phenomenon results from the deficiency of sulfur in the compound and the presence of TMTD and MBTS; consequently, the accelerator does not require the opening of the S8 ring during the curing reaction, leading to a higher curing rate index relative to other compounds. The rate of vulcanization, quantified in torque per minute, reflects the amount of cross-linking produced per time unit [44]. This measure simultaneously evaluates the degree of crosslink formation and the curing rate, thereby providing more accurate insights into the state of curing. With a value of 0.42 (dNm/min), the PMTS1 compound shows the highest rate of vulcanization formation, as shown in Fig. 2f. This compound’s curing efficiency is increased by the presence of sulfur and all of the curing ingredients, such as MBTS, TMTD accelerators, and pentaerythritol curing activator. The MTS1 compound has a higher cross-linking than the others, but because of its low CRI, it has a lower rate of vulcanization of 0.24 (dNm/min). The main cause of this problem is the lack of pentaerythritol as a curing activator.', 'Figure 3a illustrates the results for tan δ as a function of time in relation to the variations in the complex shear modulus (G*), while Fig. 3b depicts the results against the changes in complex viscosity (η*). The tan δ curve exhibits three distinct stages of the curing process. As is evident, the initial cross-linking reaction of the compounds in the induction time results in a maximum value of tan δ, which suggests that the material is softening and that there is no chemical reaction between the vulcanizing agents, rubber, and other components. The peak of tan δ can be associated with the point at which the flowability of the compounds reaches its maximum while the complex viscosity is at its lowest (Fig. 3b). No chemical reaction has occurred between the curing agents and rubber at this stage. During the curing stage, tan δ decreases rapidly due to the start of vulcanization and the formation of crosslinks. This results in a decrease in the loss shear modulus and a rapid increase in the storage shear modulus. The complex shear modulus reflects the sum of these changes and reaches its maximum in an inverse trend with tan δ (Fig. 3a).', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The optimal curing time (T90) is achieved at the conclusion of this stage. A maximum plateau is typically observed in the final stage of vulcanization, which is accompanied by torque variations with time, as obtained by MDR. The identical plateau is distinctly observable in the tan δ curve; however, tan δ stabilizes at a minimum value over time.', 'Figure 4a illustrates that the mixed shear modulus (G*) reaches its peak value of 742.0 kPa at maximum torque (MH) for the MTS1 sample, attributable to the marching modulus phenomenon and the previously detailed cases. Also, the lowest value of G* with a value of 406.6 kPa corresponds to the PMTS0 sample. This signifies that this compound possesses the lowest modulus among the compounds and consequently lacks high strength properties. The complex shear modulus (G*) is directly related to and dependent on the crosslink network, in addition to its relationship with physical–mechanical properties.', 'Changes in complex viscosity are markedly affected by torque behavior, and as the curing torque increases, the η* value also rises. This parameter is highly compatible with the formation of crosslinks; a higher η* value is associated with a greater number of crosslinks in the cured compound. Figure 4b illustrates that the MTS1 sample exhibits the maximum complex viscosity at 70,715.2 (Pa.sec),whereas the PMTS0 sample has the lowest complex viscosity at 38,752.5 (Pa.sec).', 'The PMTS0 sample has the highest tan δ value, measuring 0.18, as shown in Fig. 4c. This arises from insufficient curing of the compound and its heightened loss modulus (G″) in comparison to the storage modulus (G′). A loss or viscous term that is higher and a storage or elastic term that is smaller are the consequences of a weaker crosslink network. Therefore, the loss factor tan δ is elevated. These two compounds, PMTS1 and MTS1, exhibit the lowest loss factor of 0.07. The reason for this is the establishment of a more robust cross-linking network and the completion of an adequate curing process in comparison to other compounds.', 'DSC results', 'This section examines the thermal analysis results of compounds subjected to a heating rate of 10 ℃/min in an inert nitrogen gas atmosphere. The chemical reactions of compounds and phase transitions in certain raw materials, notably CSM rubber, have also been examined.', 'Janowska et al. [16] demonstrated that among chlorosulfonated polyethylene, only the rubber with the lowest chlorine content (approximately 24%) possesses a crystalline phase that significantly influences its glass transition temperature. The maximum thermal degradation rate also decreases as the chlorine content in the heated sample increases. Chlorosulfonated polyethylene is a specialized rubber created through the modification and functionalization of polyethylene (PE) via the concurrent application of chlorine and sulfur dioxide on polyethylene (typically LDPE) dissolved in carbon tetrachloride \xad(CCl4) in the presence of radical initiators. There is 25 to 45 wt% chlorine and 1 to 2 wt% sulfur in commercial products.', 'On average, one chlorine atom is associated with 5–7 carbon atoms, but a single chlorosulfonyl group (–SO2Cl) is associated with 80–100 carbon atoms in the main chain of CSM. Over 90% of CSM chlorine is present in the secondary groups \xad(R1R2CHCl), up to 3.5% in the tertiary groups \xad(RR1R2CCl), and up to 3% in the \xadRCH2Cl groups, including the terminal groups, and the residual chlorine located in the chlorosulfonyl groups. The functional and adhesive capabilities, along with the chemical reaction of CSM, are dependent upon the quantity of Cl and S included [16]. According to the analysis of TGA thermogravimetric curves, Janowska et al. asserted that the thermal decomposition of CSM occurs in three stages. At 180 °C, the samples exhibit mass loss due to hydrogen chloride evolution, evidenced by a minor endothermic shift in the differential thermal analysis (DTA) curves at 210 °C. The initial temperature for the thermal decomposition of elastomers is independent of the chlorine content in the CSM. The subsequent phase is characterized by a significant release of HCl, commencing at a temperature of 250 °C. An increase in the chlorine content of the CSM is accompanied by a clear increase in the rate of this process and a decrease in the sample residue following the termination of heating. The amount of chlorine and sulfur in the polymers decreases significantly in the third stage after the CSM is heated to 320 °C. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis and derived thermogravimetry (DTG) indicate that HCl evolution may occur via a chain mechanism, resulting in the formation of –CH=CH– CH=CH– double bonds [7, 16].', '@', '@', 'To validate and correlate the information acquired with the research referenced, the DSC test was performed on the CSM rubber utilized (TS-530). The rubber’s behavior is verified by the results of this test. The endothermic curve is undergoing the release of chlorine at a temperature of approximately 178.6 °C, as illustrated in Fig. 5a. Subsequently, the curve undergoes a significant decrease at 242.9 °C as a result of the release of HCl. At a temperature of 328.4 °C, a pronounced endothermic peak is detected, attributed to the substantial decrease of chlorine and sulfur in the rubber. The peak of chlorine loss at approximately 180 °C coincides with the vulcanization temperature range of the compounds. The selection of the appropriate curing temperature and time is crucial for sulfur curing, as the formation of sulfide crosslinks necessitates the separation of the chlorosulfonyl group and the subsequent release of chlorine attached to it. This is a result of the rubber curing process being coordinated with the release of chlorine. Figure 5b shows that due to the presence of pentaerythritol, all samples exhibit a prominent endothermic peak, with the exception of the MTS1 sample.', 'The heat of crystal transition of pentaerythritol is equivalent to the heat of fusion of ice. The spherical molecule of this substance transitions to a plastic crystalline state by rotating around its crystal site and breaking the intermolecular hydrogen bonds without migrating into the crystal at a specific temperature. The distinctive solid-to-solid transition defines pentaerythritol. The crystallization temperature of pentaerythritol is approximately 188 °C. Two endothermic peaks are detected in the analysis of pentaerythritol. The initial peak indicates the phase transition of pentaerythritol from a tetragonal to a cubic crystal structure at approximately 196 °C, while the subsequent broad peak at around 281.5 °C signifies its melting temperature [45].', 'To examine this phenomenon, it was essential to perform a DSC test on the pentaerythritol utilized in the compounds independently. Figure 5c illustrates a pronounced endothermic peak in this material, which complicates the analysis of the curing of chlorosulfonated polyethylene rubbers due to its overlap with the temperature range of the endothermic peak associated with chlorine release in CSM rubber and the exothermic peak of the compounds’ curing process. At a temperature of 193.1 °C, an endothermic peak indicative of the solid–solid crystalline phase transition from tetragonal to cubic is observed, alongside a melting endothermic peak (Tm) at 268.6 °C, as indicated by the research data.', '@', '@', 'Table 6 indicates that only the MTS1 sample, devoid of pentaerythritol, exhibits a peak curing temperature (Tc). Due to the endothermic peak associated with the crystalline phase change (Tp) of pentaerythritol, the peak curing of other compounds is not possible to determine. This is due to the phase transition occurring within the curing temperature range (ΔTc) of the samples. The broadest curing temperature range is exhibited by PMTS1 at 56 °C, succeeded by PTS1 at 55 °C, MTS1 at 37 °C, and PMTS0 at 36 °C, respectively. The PMTS1 sample has the highest curing temperature range. This compound offers an expanded curing range due to the inclusion of all curing components, such as activators, accelerators, and sulfur curing agents. The reduced temperature range of PTS1 relative to PMTS1 can solely be attributed to the lack of MBTS in the formulation. The other two compounds, having a shorter curing time than the previously mentioned compounds, exhibit a reduced curing temperature range and are consequently less robust.', 'As illustrated in Fig. 6a, the glass transition temperatures \xadTg of nearly all compounds are comparable, and as anticipated, there is no substantial distinction among them.', 'According to Fig. 6b, the maximum enthalpy of curing is for the PMTS1 sample with a value of 8.1 (J/g), and the lowest is for MTS1 with a value of 1.5 (J/g). The formation of a larger crosslink network and the proper curing of PMTS1 may be the reasons for its higher enthalpy of curing. The reduced enthalpy of curing for the PMTS0 compound may result from the absence of sulfur and the establishment of a less robust crosslink network. The presence of a pronounced pentaerythritol crystallinity peak hinders a more precise measurement of the enthalpy of curing. The low enthalpy of curing for the MTS1 sample results from its sluggish and feeble curing process, attributable to the lack of the pentaerythritol curing activator. The findings demonstrate a significant contribution of pentaerythritol, sulfur, and MBTS accelerator to the enhancement of curing enthalpy.', 'Figure 6c indicates that the peak dehydrochlorination or HCl release initiation temperature is associated with PTS1 at 259 °C, succeeded by PMTS1, PMTS0, and MTS1 mixtures at 256, 250, and 239 °C, respectively. This transition can indicate the type and quantity of crosslinks formed in the compounds. The formation of HCl can be shifted to higher temperatures as a result of the higher dissociation energy and the tendency toward mono- and disulfide due to the increased crosslinks. Ultimately, this transition has the potential to increase the temperature of rubber degradation. The quantity and quality of crosslinks are significantly influenced by the presence of sulfur in the mixtures and pentaerythritol, which serves as an activator of the curing system.', 'FTIR analysis', 'In Fig. 7a, the spectrum of CSM rubber shows two peaks at 1368 and 1159 \xadcm−1, which are respectively related to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration of \xadSO2, indicating the presence of the \xadSO2Cl group. The peaks at 2924 and 2853 \xadcm−1 correspond to C-H stretching vibration in CSM, while the peaks at 802, 725, and 667 \xadcm−1 are attributed to C–Cl stretching vibration. The peak at 1459 \xadcm−1 is associated with C-H bending [3, 4, 8, 21, 46]. In Fig. 7b, the peak at 1180 \xadcm−1, associated with the C-S-C bond, signifies the occurrence of sulfur cross-linking during the curing process of the MTS1 sample. The reduction in intensity of the peak at 1364 \xadcm−1, associated with \xadSO2 stretching, and the absence of the peak at 1159 \xadcm−1 signify the detachment of the sulfonyl chloride group from the main chain, resulting in the emergence of the peak at 1614 \xadcm−1, indicative of C=C stretching. In Fig. 7c, the peak at a wavenumber of 1184 \xadcm−1 associated with the C-S-C bond signifies the occurrence of sulfur cross-linking during the curing process of the PTS1 sample. Additionally, the sulfonyl chloride group’s separation from the main chain is indicated by the decrease in intensity of the peak at 1372 \xadcm−1 corresponding to \xadSO2Cl and the disappearance of the peak at 1159 \xadcm−1. This separation results in the formation of the peak at 1614 \xadcm−1 corresponding to the C=C stretching.', 'Furthermore, Fig. 7d exhibits a peak at a wavenumber of 1184 \xadcm−1, which corresponds to the C-S-C bond, suggests that sulfur cross-linking occurred during the curing of the PMTS0 sample. The reduction in intensity of the peak associated with \xadSO2Cl at 1376 \xadcm−1 and the absence of the peak at 1159 \xadcm−1 signify the detachment of the sulfonyl chloride group from the main chain, resulting in the emergence of the peak at 1622 \xadcm−1 corresponding to C=C stretching. The two sulfonate geminal peaks \xad(SO2–O–SO2) at 1543 and 1580 \xadcm−1 signify the ionic bond formed by the cross-linking of the metal oxide. In the absence of sulfur in this compound, some cross-linking is of the metal oxide variety (Scheme 1), while the remainder is of the sulfide type due to the presence of the sulfur donor [4, 12].', '@', '@', 'Figure 7e illustrates that the peak at a wavenumber of 1184 \xadcm−1, associated with the C–S–C bond, signifies the occurrence of sulfur cross-linking during the curing process of the PMTS1 sample. The reduction in intensity of the peak at 1372 \xadcm−1 associated with \xadSO2Cl and the absence of the peak at 1159 \xadcm−1 signify the detachment of the sulfonyl chloride group from the main chain, resulting in theemergence of the peak at 1610 \xadcm−1 corresponding to C=C stretching.', '@', '@', 'Suggested CSM rubber curing mechanism', 'Typically, in the majority of rubber curing processes, ZnO serves as an activator in conjunction with stearic acid, which forms a complex with accelerators, thereby generating an active species for interaction with both sulfur and the rubber chain [47–49]. In accordance with Guzman et al. [50], MgO accelerates the decomposition of the accelerator; however, ZnO produces a greater degree of cross-linking. Using CBS as an accelerator, Sánchez [51] discovered that when ZnO and MgO were mixed in NR, MgO cured with better kinetic than ZnO, but the resulting cross-linking density was significantly lower. Because MgO can generate active sulfurating agent more quickly than ZnO, it seems to have a higher affinity for sulfur. Nevertheless, MgO intermediates were unable to facilitate final cross-linking to the same extent as ZnO-activated sulfurating agents [28, 50]. Pentaerythritol enhances the cross-linking process by reacting with the acidic sites of the CSM rubber, improving the network formation during curing. CSM rubber contains chlorine and sulfonic acid groups, which can produce acidic by-products during processing and curing. These acidic species can hinder the curing process and degrade the material [52–54]. MgO acts as a primary acid scavenger by neutralizing these acidic by-products, forming magnesium salts. Pentaerythritol complements MgO by interacting with these acidic species and stabilizing the curing environment. Together, they ensure a consistent and effective vulcanization process [55]. Pentaerythritol enhances the reactivity of MgO by acting as a dispersing agent, ensuring MgO is evenly distributed throughout the rubber matrix. This uniform distribution improves the efficiency of acid neutralization and promotes better cross-linking [56, 57].', '@', '@', 'Scheme 2 illustrates the proposed mechanism for the vulcanization of chlorosulfonated polyethylene rubber. In the step 1 mechanism, for sulfur vulcanization, CSM rubber must undergo thermal degradation to release its sulfonyl chloride group, enabling the formation of unsaturated bonds in the main chain that facilitate cross-linking [58]. TMTD and MBTS accelerators were employed in the PMTS1 curing process in the presence of MgO and pentaerythritol. Based on credible sources, this schematic aims to elucidate the function of each component involved in rubber cross-linking and curing. The \xadMg2+ atom’s inability to form a strong complex with the accelerator and its ionic interactions with the polymer chains are the fundamental differences in the mechanism of this process in the presence of MgO. It is posited that the presence of MgO as a curing activator result in the formation of a greater quantity of magnesium dithiocarbamate. Nevertheless, the final crosslinks are not catalyzed by the resulting compound. In the presence of MgO, it may produce dithiocarbamate more rapidly due to the higher basicity of MgO. However, it lacks catalytic activity with sulfur to form an active sulfurating complex, resulting in an increase in the vulcanization rate. From this viewpoint, MgO acts as an alkali that stabilizes the dithiocarbamate and protects it from thermal decomposition [25, 59]. Consequently, the radical sulfurization of rubber chains is the responsibility of TMTD and MBTS. The primary catalytic species in the reaction is TMTD, which is attributed to its higher activity and concentration. Additionally, MBTS has a synergistic effect on TMTD’s activity [25, 27, 60, 61]. Due to its Lewis basicity, MgO can enhance hydrogen transfer and facilitate the progression of the rubber sulfurization process (Scheme 3).', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'In step 2 of the mechanism, heat induces the opening of the sulfur ring, and during accelerated vulcanization with TMTD, a TMTD-derived sulfurating agent bonds to the CSM rubber via an allylic moiety, resulting in crosslink formation. This mechanism produces dithiocarbamate from the cleavage of the Sx-S bond of TMTD, along with water as by-products. The proposed mechanism omits the reaction of MBTS and MBT with sulfur due to the elevated concentration of the TMTD accelerator in the formula. However, the same reaction that occurs for sulfur and TMTD also occurs for MBTS and MBT [62, 63]. In step 3 of the mechanism, the crosslink precursor is generated, and subsequently, in step 4 of the mechanism, a crosslink is established between the two CSM rubber chains.', 'Step 5 clearly illustrates how, in the absence of MgO in the curing reaction, the existing dithiocarbamate is thermally degraded into dimethylamine and carbon disulfide. The curing reaction then slows down and eventually stops because dithiocarbamate recovery is impossible. Step 6 indicates that magnesium dithiocarbamate is formed more quickly because of the reaction of dithiocarbamate with MgO in the presence of pentaerythritol. The conversion of MgO into the \xadMg2+ dithiocarbamate complex also occurs using the hydrochloric acid that was released in step 1. The findings indicate that magnesium oxide, when combined with pentaerythritol, significantly improves sulfur vulcanization activity, whereas MgO alone exhibits restricted efficacy in activating the curing system. In accordance with the mechanism of step 7, magnesium dithiocarbamate can exhibit synergism with MBTS, resulting in an increased cross-linking network relative to systems utilizing individual accelerators. This complex subsequently interacts with MBTS to produce the MBT accelerator and regenerate TMTD, thereby inhibiting the thermal degradation of dithiocarbamate [25].', 'Conclusion', 'The sample containing pentaerythritol, MBTS, TMTD, and sulfur exhibits the maximum rate of vulcanization, as indicated by the results of rheometric tests and viscoelastic properties. Also, the loss factor is the lowest in this sample and the compound without pentaerythritol. Due to the marching modulus phenomenon, a very long optimal curing time, and a low curing rate index, the sample lacking pentaerythritol is not a suitable compound when compared to the formulation containing all of the ingredients. This results from the lack of pentaerythritol in the presence of magnesium oxide within the formulation during the curing reaction. Nevertheless, this compound exhibits a slightly more extensive cross-linking network. Based on the results of the DSC test, the compound that contains all of the ingredients has the highest curing enthalpy, while the sample that lacks pentaerythritol has the lowest. The elevated curing enthalpy of this compound results from efficient curing and enhanced cross-linking network formation. Conversely, the formulation devoid of pentaerythritol exhibits a lower curing enthalpy due to the slow and insufficient curing process, which is a consequence of the absence of pentaerythritol during the curing process. Dehydrochlorination has a maximum temperature of 259 °C in the MBTS-free formulation. 256 °C is the temperature of the compound that contains all ingredients. It is evident that the type of linkages tends toward mono- and disulfide as the crosslink network is formed. The reason for this is the increased dissociation energy, which can also elevate the temperature of rubber degradation and increase the temperature of HCl formation.', 'According to FTIR studies, all of the compounds possess sulfide bonds. Nevertheless, the sulfur-free compound also possesses an ionic bond that is the result of metal oxide cross-linking. The extent of sulfide cross-linking is attributable to the utilization of TMTD, which functions as both an accelerator and a sulfur donor.', 'In the absence of sulfur in the CSM rubber curing system and the use of a sulfur donor, it is possible for two sulfide and metal oxide curing mechanisms to exist simultaneously, as indicated by the results. Despite the fact that this reaction is highly unstable due to ionic bonds, it occurs at an extremely fast and low cross-linking rate. However, the dithiocarbamate will undergo thermal degradation and TMTD recovery will be impossible if pentaerythritol is not used in conjunction with MgO. The proposed mechanism and the function of each material in the formulations are established by the results of rheometric, DSC, and FTIR analysis, which exhibit a significant degree of concordance.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Author contribution Mohammad Reza Pourhossaini conceptualized and designed the study.

This study systematically evaluates the electrical, mechanical, and biocompatibility properties of PBFDO and compares its performance with the widely used material for bioelectronics; poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). The intrinsic doping mechanism of PBFDO provides high electrical conductivity (up to 2000 S/cm) without requiring external dopants, enhancing its environmental stability and simplifying fabrication. Surface characterizations revealed uniform coatings and hydrophilic properties suitable for bioelectronics. Notably, PBFDO demonstrated exceptional electrical stability in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), retaining 97% of its initial conductivity after three days. Biocompatibility assays using NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells showed no cytotoxic effects, with cell proliferation rates comparable to bare glass and crosslinked PEDOT:PSS. These findings establish PBFDO as a robust and biocompatible material for next-generation bioelectronic devices, including neural probes, biosensors, and implantable electrodes.', 'Graphical abstract', 'We highlight PBFDO as a promising biocompatible electrode material for neural probes. PBFDO demonstrates intrinsically high conductivity, exceptional stability in aqueous environments, and excellent biocompatibility, all without the need for modification or post-treatment, outperforming PEDOT:PSS. These properties make PBFDO an ideal candidate for use in neural probes, offering superior material performance.', '@', 'Keywords PBFDO · Electrical conductivity · Electrical stability · Biocompatibility · Bioelectronics', '1 Introduction', 'Neural probes play an essential role in neuroscience and biomedical engineering, offering efficient tools for recording and stimulating neural activity [1–5]. These devices provide critical insights into neural circuitry, enabling advancements in treatments for neurological disorders and the development of brain-machine inter-faces. The functionality and durability of neural probes are highly dependent on the properties of the electrode materials. Traditional materials, including metals and doped semiconductors, often encounter limitations such as high impedance, mechanical stiffness mismatch, and poor biocompatibility, which are critical for bioapplica-tions [6, 7]. Furthermore, these materials can provoke immune responses, potentially leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and impaired device performance [6, 8]. These challenges necessitate the development of alterna-tive materials that combine high electrical conductivity, adjustable mechanical stiffness to match biological tissues, and excellent biocompatibility.', 'Organic electrode materials, with their tunable proper-ties enabled by modifications to their molecular structure, are attractive candidates for addressing the limitations of traditional electrode materials [9–13]. Among these, conductive polymers have garnered significant attention due to high electrical conductivity, tunable mechanical characteristics, and potential biocompatibility [14, 15]. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is widely recognized as a leading con-ductive polymer [16]. However, PEDOT:PSS has cer-tain drawbacks for use in bioengineering applications in terms of a requirement to satisfy biocompatibility, high electrical conductivity, and stability under wet condition, at once [17]. The acidity of PSS chain, which is a well-known factor causing degradation in electronic devices, can damage on living organisms from a long-term per-spective [18]. Moreover, additives or post-treatments to enhance electrical conductivity by removing exces-sive PSS imposes significant adverse effect on bio-compatibility of PEDOT:PSS [19]. On the other hand, poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO) has recently emerged as a conductive polymer with notable advantages [20]. Unlike PEDOT:PSS, PBFDO does not require additives or post-treatments to enhance its electrical conductivity, avoiding risk factors (Fig. 1). In addition, according to the previous report [20], PBFDO shows superior chemical sta-bilities for various acids, base, and organic solvents, with enhanced environmental tolerance. Despite these promis-ing properties, the biocompatibility of PBFDO remains underexplored, which limits its immediate application in bioelectronics. This study evaluates the potential of PBFDO as a biocompatible electrode by systematically assessing its conductivity, electrical stability, and cell viability.', '2 \x07Experimental', '2.1 \x07Materials', '3,7-Dihydrobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran-2,6-dione was pur-chased from Alfa Chemistry.

Unlike conventional conjugated poly-mers that require an additional doping step to achieve high electrical conductivity, PBFDO exhibits an intrinsically high conductivity of up to 2000 S/cm, even without external dop-ing [20]. This remarkable conductivity arises from the dual role of the oxidant, which not only facilitates the formation of radicals in the monomer to enable polymerization but also induces protonation of the ester group in PBFDO, result-ing in n-type doping (Scheme 1). We synthesized PBFDO according to previous reports [20, 21], and the characteriza-tion was followed. UV–vis absorption spectra of the synthe-sized PBFDO revealed broad (bi)polaron absorption bands, indicative of the highly doped state (Fig. 2a). O 1s X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed the high doping level, with the protonated ester peak observed at approximately 534.7 eV (Fig. 2b). The area ratio of the protonated ester groups accounted for 45% of the total ester groups, indicating that 0.9 of the two ester groups per repeat-ing unit were protonated, corresponding to a doping effi-ciency of 0.9 electrons per repeating unit.', 'The four-point-probe measurement confirmed that thethin film fabricated with the synthesized PBFDO showedelectrical conductivity of up to 2022 S/cm (Fig. 2c), consist-ent with the previous report [20].', 'The intrinsically high conductivity of PBFDO offers sev-eral advantages compared to PEDOT:PSS, a widely usedconjugated polymer in bioengineering applications. By eliminating the need for additional processing steps, PBFDO simplifies fabrication and reduces potential sources of vari-ability. Unlike PEDOT:PSS, which often relies additives to achieve biocompatibility, high conductivity, and stability in aqueous solution [15], PBFDO stands itself without the need for additional modifications. Therefore, the intrinsically high conductivity not only simplifies the manufacturing process but also minimizes the risk of introducing external factors that could compromise device reliability, particularly in long-term bioengineering applications.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '3.2 \x07Surface characteristics', 'The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of both PEDOT:PSS and PBFDO thin films reveal well-dispersed and uniformly coated surfaces, indicating successful film formation (Fig. 3a). The absence of significant surface irregularities or aggregation suggests that both materials achieve homogeneous coatings, which is critical for main-taining consistent electrical properties and ensuring reliable performance in bioelectronic applications. This uniformcoating further supports their suitability for use in neuralinterfaces, where surface consistency is essential for mini-mizing impedance variability and enhancing signal fidelity.', 'The hydrophilicity of PEDOT:PSS and PBFDO thin films were evaluated using water contact angle (WCA) measure-ments (Fig. 3b). To ensure the stability of the films in aque-ous environments, substrates were pre-treated with 3-ami-nopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) to form a self-assembled monolayer, enhancing film adhesion. Both PBFDO and PEDOT:PSS films displayed WCAs below 90°, indicative of hydrophilic surfaces. The WCA of the PBFDO thin film (53.0°) was lower than the previously reported value for PBFDO films (75.4°). This discrepancy is attributed to the smoother surface morphology of our film, which has a root-mean-square roughness (Rq) of 1.145 nm. Moreover, the WCA can be significantly affected by the surface energy of the APTES monolayer fabricated on the substrate beneath the thin film (thickness < 30 nm) [22]. This hydrophilic-ity confirms the compatibility of PBFDO thin films with aqueous systems, a critical property for their application in neural interfaces.', '@', '@', '3.3 \x07Electrical stability', 'The electrical stability of PEDOT:PSS and PBFDO thin films in deionized water and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was examined to assess their potential as neural probe materials (Fig. 3c). The relative electrical conductiv-ity preservation was compared at three and seven days. Both PEDOT:PSS and PBFDO showed decreased conductivity in deionized water; however, PBFDO shows better stabil-ity. PEDOT:PSS retained over 64% and 62% of its initial conductivity after three and seven days, while PBFDO main-tained approximately 77% and 73%, respectively. Moreo-ver, PBFDO showed more retaining results in PBS. Notably, PBFDO demonstrated exceptional stability in PBS, retain-ing 97% and 92% of its initial conductivity over the same time frames, while PEDOT:PSS showed 59% and 56%, respectively.', 'The observed decrease in the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS can be primarily attributed to the degradation of the thin films through gradual PEDOT:PSS dissolution in the aque-ous media, as well as the defect occurrence at PEDOT backbone by aging, particularly over extended periods [23]. Even though the APTES was pre-treated on the substrates to enhance the adhesion of the PEDOT:PSS thin film, the water solubility and ionic nature of PSS make it susceptible to dis-solution of PEDOT in those aqueous media. This leachingphenomenon disrupts structural integrity and elevates sheetresistance, leading to a decline in electrical conductivity.', 'In contrast, PBFDO exhibited better stability, especially in PBS. This exceptional stability in aqueous media can be explained by its unique molecular structure and intrinsically high chemical resistance. In contrast to PEDOT:PSS, which is composed of two components, PBFDO functions indepen-dently without the need for stabilizers or secondary-bonded charge balancers, and therefore exhibits no dissolution in aqueous media. Moreover, the protonation of ester groups in PBFDO with the low Fermi level reported as − 4.67 eV creates a stable n-type doping state itself, which is less sus-ceptible to hydrolytic or oxidative degradation under physi-ological conditions [20]. The ionic composition of PBS may also stabilize the doped state of PBFDO by reducing poten-tial ion exchange processes, further preserving its conduc-tivity. These findings highlight the advantages of PBFDO over PEDOT:PSS, emphasizing its potential as a reliable material for neural probes that require long-term operation in challenging biological environments.', '3.4 \x07Biocompatibility', 'The CCK-8 assay was conducted to evaluate the biocompat-ibility of PBFDO by assessing its effects on cellular behavior over 1, 3, and 7 days (Fig. 3d).

Bare glass, a well-known biocom-patible material, served as the control group to benchmark the cytotoxic effects of PBFDO surfaces, while crosslinked PEDOT:PSS was included as a reference. In detail, (3-gly-cidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GOPS) was introduced as a crosslinking agent for PEDOT:PSS; GOPS prevents PEDOT:PSS to be dissolved in aqueous media by crosslink-ing, and the crosslinked PEDOT:PSS was previously reported as biocompatible, which makes it desirable to use as the reference [24, 25]. At all measured time points (1, 3, and 7 days), there were no statistically significant differences in absorbance values among the samples. This consistency suggests that both PBFDO and crosslinked PEDOT:PSS sur-faces are non-cytotoxic and support cell proliferation com-parable to the bare glass control. The absence of cytotoxic effects highlights the suitability of PBFDO as a material for bioelectronics, particularly in applications requiring long-term interaction with biological tissues.', 'To use as biocompatible electrodes, PEDOT:PSS must satisfy complex requirements: stability in aqueous media,sufficiently high conductivity, and biocompatibility. How-ever, PBFDO avoids these challenging hurdles by itself.Without any modification and additional process, PBFDOshows notable biocompatibility with high stability in aque-ous media and high electrical conductivity, confirming thatPBFDO is a promising material for neural probe.', '4 \x07Conclusions', 'This study highlights the potential of PBFDO as a next-generation material for bioelectronics, particularly in neu-ral probe applications. The intrinsic doping mechanism of PBFDO enables high electrical conductivity and enhanced environmental stability without requiring external dopants or additives, addressing key limitations of traditional con-jugated polymers like PEDOT:PSS. Surface characteriza-tion confirmed uniform coating and hydrophilic properties essential for effective bioelectronic interfaces. In aque-ous environments, PBFDO exhibited superior electrical stability, particularly in PBS, where it retained over 97% of its initial conductivity, underscoring its suitability for long-term use in physiological conditions. Biocompat-ibility evaluations using NIH-3T3 fibroblast cells dem-onstrated that PBFDO supports cell proliferation without cytotoxic effects, performing comparably to bare glass and crosslinked PEDOT:PSS. These results confirm that PBFDO meets the critical requirements for neural probe materials, including high conductivity, environmental stability, and biocompatibility. In conclusion, this work suggests PBFDO as a versatile and reliable material forits integration into advanced biomedical devices, includ-ing neural interfaces, biosensors, and implantable systems.

Since the spatial distribution of dopants in doped polymer films significantly influences their electrical properties, elucidating how various material parameters affect the dopant distribution in sequentially solution-doped polymer films is of great importance. This study investigates the effect of crystallinity in conjugated polymer thin films on the spatial distribution of dopants along the out-of-plane direction. The results show that higher crystallinity in polymer films leads to a more non-uniform dopant distribution, with a greater composition of dopants at the film surface compared to the bulk. This phenomenon is attributed to the crystallinity-dependent swellability of polymer films, where films with higher crystallinity exhibit lower swellability, resulting in less efficient dopant diffusion from the surface to the bulk compared to films with lower crystallinity.', 'Graphic abstract', 'This study explores how crystallinity in conjugated polymer thin films affects dopant distribution during sequential solution doping, revealing that higher crystallinity results in a more nonuniform distribution, with greater dopant compositions at the surface than in the bulk. This is due to lower swellability, which limits effective dopant diffusion from the surface to the bulk.', '@', 'Keywords Chemical doping · Conjugated polymers · Molecular dopants · Crystallinity · Sequential solution doping', '1 Introduction', 'Conjugated polymers have garnered significant attention in the field of organic electronics due to their unique optoelectronic properties [1–10]. One promising approach to enhance the performance of conjugated polymers is through doping, particularly in the field of polymer electrodes and organic thermoelectrics [3, 7, 11–16]. Doping involves introducing additional molecules into a polymer film to control the charge carrier concentration via charge transfer between them, resulting in changes to the polymer’s optical and electrical properties, such as electrical conductivity, Fermi level, and light absorption coefficients in visible and near-infrared ranges [17–19]. The development of efficient dopants and doping methods, along with a concrete understanding of the underlying principles, is essential for improving the performance of doped conjugated polymers in various applications.', 'Two commonly employed solution-based doping techniques used in the doping of conjugated polymers are mixed-solution doping and sequential solution doping. Mixed-solution doping of a conjugated polymer involves the blending of the polymer and dopant in one solution, followed by the deposition of the blend solution to obtain a doped polymer film [3]. Although this method is advantageous for the precise control of the ratio between the polymer and dopant, it often suffers from severe aggregation of charged polymers within the solution and poor quality of the resulting polymer films [20]. On the other hand, sequential solution doping of a conjugated polymer involves exposing a precast undoped polymer film to a dopant solution for an extended time, which then leads to the diffusion of dopant molecules into the polymer film [21]. This method allows for effective doping of polymer thin films without significantly damaging their microstructure, making it widely used for doping polymer thin films with optimized microstructures [18, 22].', 'Sequential solution doping, despite its advantages, presents some challenges. Since this doping method relies on the diffusion of dopant molecules within the already solidified polymer films, it may take a significant amount of time for the dopant molecules to penetrate deeply into the film [23, 24]. This means that for relatively thick polymer films, the dopant may not diffuse effectively throughout the entire film, resulting in considerable nonuniformity in dopant content and doping levels between the surface region and the bulk of the film. Non-uniform doping in thick polymer films can pose a serious drawback in the application of doped conjugated polymers. For example, in typical Π-structured thermoelectric devices based on conjugated polymers, a thick film is inevitably required to maximize the temperature difference across the device [25, 26]; however, the non-uniform doping in this thick film can lead to a significant deterioration of the thermoelectric performance of the device. In this context, understanding the distribution of dopant molecules within sequentially solution-doped polymer films and the factors influencing this distribution is crucial.', 'this distribution is crucial.Although many studies have revealed the spatial distribution of dopants within sequentially doped conjugated polymer films, they have primarily focused on where the dopants prefer to reside within the crystalline and amorphous regions of polymer films, or on how the inclusion of dopants affects the polymer’s crystalline structure [14–16, 27–30]. In contrast, the distribution of dopants along the thickness direction (i.e., along the out-of-plane direction) has received relatively little attention. A recent study demonstrated that doping of a conjugated polymer film using the immersion doping method leads to a significantly non-uniform dopant distribution along the thickness direction due to the limited diffusivity of dopants within the film [31]. While the study thoroughly examined the dopant diffusion process within a conjugated polymer film, it did not provide insights into how the film’s microstructure influences dopant diffusion behavior and spatial distribution. In this work, we investigate the effect of polymer crystallinity on the dopant distribution along the thickness direction of sequentially solution-doped conjugated polymer films. Using regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as a model conjugated polymer, we characterized the dopant distribution by varying the crystallinity of the polymer film via thermal annealing. Under the same conditions of sequential solution doping, it was found that while the overall dopant content within two polymer films with different degrees of crystallinity was almost similar, the distribution of dopants along the depth direction was different. The film with higher crystallinity exhibited greater nonuniformity in dopant distribution, with the ratio of dopant content between the film surface and bulk being higher in the film with greater crystallinity compared to the film with lower crystallinity. These differences are attributed to different swellabilities of the polymer films due to variations in their crystallinity, which affect the diffusion of dopant molecules within the films during the doping process.', '2 \x07Experimental', '2.1 \x07Materials', 'P3HT with regioregularity of ≥ 90% was purchased from Rieke Metals Inc. (USA). 2,3,5,6-Tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ, > 98%) was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Japan). Acetonitrile (ACN, ≥ 99.5%) and chloroform (CF, anhydrous, ≥ 99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc.(Germany). The materials were used without any furtherpurification.', '2.2 \x07Preparation of polymer thin films and their sequential solution doping', 'Either soda-lime glass or a Si wafer with a native oxide was used as the substrates for sample preparation. The substrates were cleaned sequentially with detergent (Extran MA 02, Merck Millipore), deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. The substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 20 min before applying polymer solution on them. The polymer solution (5 mg \xadmL−1) was prepared by dissolving P3HT in CF at 55 °C. Then, the P3HT solution was spin-coated onto the substrates at 2000 rpm for 60 s. The resulting polymer films had a thickness of ~ 47 nm. For thermal annealing, P3HT films were placed on hot plates with a surface temperature of 200 °C for 10 min. For sequential solution doping, the dopant solution was prepared by dissolving F4TCNQ in ACN at room temperature. The concentration of the F4TCNQ dopant solution varied from 0.15 to 2.0 wt%. Doping was performed by dropping the dopant solution onto the polymer film to cover the entire surface and maintaining it for a minute to allow diffusion of dopant molecules into the polymer film. Then, the residual dopant solution was removed by spin-coating. After the doping process, doped polymer films were thermally annealed for 5 min at a mild temperature of 85 °C, which is slightly above the boiling temperature of ACN, to completely dry the doped polymer films. The entire processes of solution preparation, spin-coating, thermal annealing, and sequential solution doping were performed in a nitrogen-filled glove box.', '2.3 \x07Measurement of swelling ratio of polymer films', 'The swelling ratio of polymer films was calculated from the thicknesses of the polymer films before and after swelling in ACN. To swell the polymer films, pure ACN was poured into a glass petri dish, and the polymer films coated on Si substrates were immersed in the ACN for a minute. After being lifted from the ACN, the surface of polymer films was dried quickly by blowing with nitrogen gas to eliminate any residual solvent droplets. Then, the thicknesses of the polymer films were measured using ellipsometry (M-2000 ellipsometer, J.A. Woollam), using the Cauchy model to fit the recorded spectra in the 860–1000 nm wavelength range. Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) measurementswere performed at the 3C and 9A beamlines of Pohang', '2.4 \x07Other characterizations Accelerator Laboratory (PAL), Korea. The photon energy was 9.30 keV (λ = 1.33 Å). The sample-to-detector distance was 214 mm. The incidence angle of X-ray beam was set around the critical angle of the polymer film. To compare the surface structure and the bulk structure of the polymer films, the GIXD data were recorded by varying the incidence angle by 0.5° above and below the critical angle. Ultraviolet–visible–near-infrared (UV–Vis–NIR) absorption spectra were obtained using a V-770 spectrometer (Jasco). Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained using a VERTEX 70v FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker).', '3 \x07Results and discussion', '3.1 \x07Conjugated polymer thin films with different crystallinities', 'In this study, regioregular P3HT was chosen as a model conjugated polymer (Fig. 1a). P3HT thin films with different crystallinities were prepared to investigate the effect of polymer crystallinity on the dopant diffusion into polymer thin films during solution sequential doping. F4TCNQ, one of the most widely used molecular dopants for p-doping of conjugated polymers, was used in this study to dope the P3HT films via the sequential solution doping method. ACN was selected as the solvent for the dopant solution. ACN is a poor solvent for P3HT but dissolves F4TCNQ well, so it is widely used for sequential solution doping of P3HT films [21, 30, 32].', 'Thermal annealing of P3HT films at elevated temperatures is known to increase the crystallinity of the films [33]. To confirm the increased crystallinity of thermally annealed P3HT (P3HT-T) film compared to that of as-prepared P3HT (P3HT-A) film, two-dimensional (2D) GIXD measurements were performed (Fig. 1b and c). Figure 1b shows the 2D image of the diffraction pattern of P3HT-A and P3HT-T films, and Fig. 1c shows the corresponding one-dimensional diffraction intensity profiles along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. The diffraction patterns showed (h00) peaks and (010) peaks along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, indicating a bimodal orientation distribution (i.e., both edge-on and face-on orientations coexist) of P3HT crystallites. Compared to the P3HT-A film, the P3HT-T film showed much stronger (h00) peak intensities along the out-of-plane direction and (010) peak intensity along the in-plane direction. This result indicates that the P3HT-T film has greater crystallinity than the P3HT-A film, and that P3HT-T film has a greater portion of edge-on oriented crystallites among the bimodal orientation distribution compared to the P3HT-A film.', '@', '@', '3.2 \x07Spectroscopic characterizations on doped polymer films', 'To compare the doping behavior of P3HT-A and P3HT-T films during the sequential solution doping process, the polymer films were doped with the F4TCNQ dopant solution dissolved in ACN. The details of the sequential solution doping process can be found in the Experimental section.', 'FT-IR spectra of undoped and doped P3HT-A and P3HT-T films were measured to confirm the presence of dopant molecules within the doped polymer films (Fig. 2a). In both P3HT-A and P3HT-T, regardless of whether they were doped or not, the vibronic peaks at 2800–3000 \xadcm−1, which corresponded to C–H stretching of alkanes in their hexyl side chains [34], were commonly observed. The presence of F4TCNQ in the doped polymer films was evident from the appearance of vibronic peaks at 2170 and 2189 \xadcm−1, which corresponded to C≡N stretching in F4TCNQ anions [27]. For reference, the C≡N-stretching peak of a neutral F4TCNQ molecule is known to appear at ~ 2230 \xadcm−1 [27]. When the absorption spectra of doped P3HT-A and doped P3HT-T films were normalized by the absorption maximum of the C–H-stretching peaks of each spectrum, the normalized absorption intensities of the C≡N-stretching peaks were nearly the same (Fig. 2b), suggesting nearly the same amount of F4TCNQ anions in the two films.', '@', '@', 'UV–Vis–NIR absorption spectra were obtained to assess the occurrence and extent of doping in P3HT-A and P3HT-T before and after sequential solution doping. The left and right panels of Fig. 2c represent the absorption spectra of P3HT-A and P3HT-T films, respectively, sequentially solution-doped with the dopant solutions at various dopant concentrations. Both P3HT-A and P3HT-T films showed similar changes in spectral shapes upon doping. In the undoped state, they showed an absorption band in the visible-wavelength range at around 300–650 nm, with a maximum absorption at 550 nm. The higher crystallinity of the P3HT-T film compared to that of the P3HT-A film could be confirmed again by the more pronounced absorption shoulder at ~ 600 nm in the P3HT-T film [33]. Upon doping the polymer films with F4TCNQ, a decrease in the initial absorption at around 500 nm and the emergence of a broad absorption peak between 1000 and 2000 nm were observed, due to the formation of positive polarons in P3HT [27, 35]. Additionally, distinct peaks at 413, 770, and 870 nm appeared in the spectra of doped polymer films, which are well known to be associated with the F4TCNQ anions formed by the electron transfer from P3HT to F4TCNQ upon doping [27]. The decrease in the initial absorption intensity and the increase of newly formed absorption peaks due to doping became more pronounced as the dopant concentration in solution increased, indicating a higher doping level of P3HT for the film doped with the dopant solution of greater concentration. When comparing the spectra of P3HT-A and P3HT-T films doped at the same dopant concentration, the intensities of P3HT positive polarons and F4TCNQ anions were slightly greater in P3HT-T than in P3HT-A; this was observed for all dopant concentrations tested. The greater polymer positive polaron and dopant anion intensities in P3HT-T than in P3HT-A, despite nearly the same dopant contents within them, suggested that the ionization of the dopant was slightly more efficient in the P3HT-T film than in the P3HT-A film, likely due to its greater degree of crystallinity and charge delocalization [36].', '3.3 \x07Effect of polymer crystallinity on the dopant distribution within polymer films', 'The effect of the polymer film’s crystallinity on the spatialdistribution of dopant molecules along the out-of-plane direction was investigated based on the structural analysis of the doped polymer films using 2D GIXD (Fig. 3). 2D GIXD measurements were performed at different X-ray incidence angles to compare the surface structure and the bulk structure of the doped P3HT films. At low incidence angles below the critical angle of the polymer film, the incident beam interacts with the polymer film at only a short distance below the film surface. In contrast, at high incidence angles above the critical angle of the polymer film, the incident beam penetrates the polymer film and interacts primarily with the bulk of the film. Therefore, comparing GIXD data obtained slightly below and above the critical angle is an effective way to assess the surface and bulk structures of the polymer films [37, 38].', 'Figure 3a shows the 2D images of GIXD patterns for doped P3HT-A and doped P3HT-T films obtained at low and high incidence angles. Figure 3b presents the one-dimensional intensity profiles along the out-of-plane direction derived from the 2D images in Fig. 3a. The profiles of undoped films are also shown in the plot for comparison. The (h00) and (010) diffraction peaks of P3HT crystals were observed in the doped films, similar to those in the undoped films. However, the peak positions shifted significantly upon doping; the (h00) peaks shifted toward smaller q values, while the (010) peak shifted toward larger q values. This trend is consistent with the previous reports [21, 28, 32], and such changes in crystal structure indicate that F4TCNQ molecules are incorporated within P3HT crystallites, especially in the lamellar regions between hexyl side chains of P3HT [28, 29]. In addition to the diffraction peaks of P3HT, the doped P3HT films also showed a new diffraction peak at q =  ~ 0.84 Å−1, which is assigned to the diffraction pattern that arises from F4TCNQ [27, 39].', 'Doped P3HT-A and P3HT-T films showed distinct X-ray incident angle dependence in their peak positions. While the doped P3HT-A film exhibited nearly the same (100) and (010) peak positions regardless of the incidence angle, the doped P3HT-T film displayed different (100) and (010) peak positions depending on the incidence angle. In the case of the doped P3HT-A, the (010) peak appeared at q = 1.691 and 1.689 Å−1 for high and low incidence angles, respectively, indicating virtually the same peak positions. The position of the (100) peak could not be quantified accurately due to its weak and broad nature. In contrast, in the case of the doped P3HT-T, the (010) peak appeared at q = 1.715 and 1.743 Å−1 for high and low incidence angles, respectively, while the (100) peak appeared at q = 0.341 and 0.333 Å−1 for high and low incidence angles, respectively. This suggests that the crystalline structure at the surface region of the doped P3HT-T film is quite different from that of the bulk region, with the surface region exhibiting more increased lamellar spacing and more decreased π–π stacking distance compared to thoseof the film’s bulk. The changes in π–π stacking distanceand lamellar spacing are presented in Fig. 3c.', '@', '@', '@', 'Considering that the π–π stacking distance decreases more and the lamellar spacing increases more with respect to the increasing amount of dopant molecules incorporated into the P3HT crystals [32], the observed dependence of the diffraction peak position of doped P3HT-T on the X-ray incidence angle implies that the dopant concentration near the surface of doped P3HT-T is relatively greater than that in the bulk. On the other hand, the independence of the diffraction peak position of doped P3HT-A from the X-ray incidence angle indicates that there is no significant difference in the dopant concentration between the surface and the bulk regions of doped P3HT-A film.', 'It should be noted that, as confirmed earlier by the FT-IR spectroscopy results, the amount of dopant molecules present in the two polymer films is almost similar. Therefore, the above GIXD results do not arise from the difference in the absolute content of dopants within the two P3HT films, but rather from the different degrees of dopant diffusion from polymer surface toward the bulk, for the same overall of dopant contents within the films. That is, the diffusion of the dopant into the bulk of the film was less efficient in the more crystalline P3HT-T, resulting in a greater amount of dopant near the surface compared to the bulk.', '3.4 \x07Discussion on the origin of crystallinity‑dependent dopant distribution', 'It has been reported that the degree of swelling of a polymer thin film by solvents depends on the crystallinity of the polymer film; the higher the crystallinity of a conjugated polymer thin film, the lower the swelling ratio of the film, in general [40–43]. According to previous studies on the swelling of semicrystalline polymers, polymer crystallites are hardly penetrable to solvents, and thus, swelling occurs predominantly in the amorphous phase of the polymer films [42, 43]. Therefore, the trend of decreasing swelling ratio with respect to increasing polymer crystallinity can be understood as a result of the greater content of polymer crystallites within the film with higher crystallinity than that within the film with lower crystallinity. Based on this knowledge, we speculated that the swellability of P3HT thin films would change as a result of varied crystallinity of the films via thermal annealing; that is, the P3HT-T film would exhibit a smaller swelling ratio than the P3HT-A film when they reached swelling equilibrium with ACN due to its greater crystallinity. This speculation was shown to be valid by directly measuring the thickness of P3HT-A and P3HT-T films before and after swelling (Fig. 4). Film thicknesses were measured using an ellipsometer, fitting the recorded spectral data using the Cauchy model. In the fitting process, only the wavelength region of 860–1000 nm was used to avoid the excitonic absorption peaks of the polymer films. In swelling the polymer films, pure ACN was used as the swelling agent, because it is the solvent of the F4TCNQ dopant solution used in our sequential solution doping process. The detailed procedure for swelling polymer films is provided in the Experimental section. After dipping the P3HT-A and P3HT-T polymer films in pure ACN for 5 min, the thickness of the films increased considerably compared to the initial (i.e., dried-state) thickness, indicating the uptake of ACN molecules in the polymer films. While the thicknesses of the dried P3HT-A and P3HT-T films are almost identical at ~ 47 nm, the thicknesses of the swelled films were significantly different, showing 53 (± 1.5) and 49 (± 0.2) nm for P3HT-A and P3HT-T, respectively (Fig. 4a). The corresponding percent increase in the film thickness was 11.3% for P3HT-A and 4.0% for P3HT-T (Fig. 4b). These results clearly show that the swellability of the P3HT films depends significantly on their crystallinities.', 'We expect that the crystallinity-dependent dopant distribution originates mainly from the different swellability of the polymer films. Swelling of polymer films by dopant solvent is known to be essential for the efficient diffusion of dopant molecules into polymer films during sequential solution doping process [20, 22, 43]. Previous studies have reported that the more a polymer swells due to the dopant solvent, the easier the dopant diffusion can occur during sequential solution doping [20, 22]. Therefore, it is likely that the lower degree of swelling of P3HT-T compared to P3HT-A, due to its higher crystallinity, would lead to less-effective dopant diffusion into the bulk of the polymer film, resulting in the pronounced nonuniformity of the F4TCNQ distribution along the depth direction in doped P3HT-T film compared to that of doped P3HT-A film. The effect of polymer crystallinity on the dopant distribution of sequentially solution-doped polymer film is depicted schematically in Fig. 4c.', 'One might think that the different diffusion rates of dopants in the crystalline and amorphous regions of P3HT would also affect the dopant distribution in doped P3HT-A and P3HT-T films. Previous studies investigating the correlation between dopant diffusion and the ordering of conjugated polymers have demonstrated that dopant molecules tend to diffuse more slowly in disordered regions than in ordered regions of polythiophene-based conjugated polymer thin films [23, 44]. Based on this, if the different dopant distributions in P3HT-A and P3HT-T films originated from different diffusion rates of dopants in crystalline and amorphous regions, the dopant distribution should be more uniform along the depth direction in P3HT-T than of dopant diffusion behavior into polymer films with differentcrystallinities and swellabilities. The consequent dopant distributionwithin each film is also demonstrated', '@', '@', 'in P3HT-A due to its higher crystallinity; however, our experimental observations indicate the opposite. Therefore, the observed dopant distribution cannot be explained based on different diffusion coefficients of dopants in crystalline and amorphous regions. Instead, it is more plausible that the different dopant distributions in P3HT-A and P3HT-T films are primarily attributed to their different degrees of swelling during the sequential solution doping process.', '4 \x07Conclusions', 'In summary, we investigated the effect of polymer crystallinity on the spatial distribution of dopants, especially along the direction perpendicular to the film surface, within sequentially solution-doped polymer films. The crystallinity of conjugated polymer films was controlled by thermal annealing, which resulted in greater crystallinity for the thermally annealed film compared to that of the as-prepared film. When the two films were sequentially doped with a dopant solution under the same conditions, they showed nearly the same dopant content over the entire film but had different dopant distributions along the depth direction; the film with greater crystallinity exhibited a more uneven distribution of the dopant compared to that with lower crystallinity, with a higher composition of the dopant at the surface than in the bulk. The difference in the dopant distributions was attributed to the different degree of swelling between the two films. That is, the film with higher crystallinity swelled less by the dopant solvent, which likely resulted in a relatively less efficient diffusion of the dopant from the surface into the bulk, leading to a higher concentration of dopant near the surface compared to the bulk. The findings of this study provide a deep understanding of how the structure of polymer films affects the diffusion behavior of dopants during the sequential solution doping process and are believed to offer insights into more efficient and systematic control of doping in conjugated polymer thin films.', 'Acknowledgements Y.

Sarathchandran3 · Anjaly Sivadas1 · Robert A. Shanks4 The crystallization kinetics, spherulitic growth rate and morphology development of a non-polar blend mixture [isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and natural rubber (NR)] with strong dynamic asymmetry are investigated comprehensively. Melt mixed samples of iPP and natural NR with different NR loading were subjected to ther-mal analysis using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric (TGA) followed by crystal growth using optical microscopy (OM). Prior to melt mixing, the NR samples were masticated for 30 min so as to reduce the molecular weight. Detailed evaluation of the kinetics of crystallization, growth rate of crystals, and morphology development in a dynamically asymmetric system is challenging especially when the second component is a semi-crystalline polymer and studies on such systems have not received significant attention.', 'Received: 27 December 2024 / Revised: 14 February 2025 / Accepted: 9 March 2025  © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025', 'Abstract', 'Introduction', 'Mixing two or more polymers is a well-established approach for designing materials with specific end use [1]. Changes in inherent characteristics and processing conditions of the component polymers are the main factors that influence the ultimate properties of polymer blends. Morphology and thermal properties of individual polymers play a major role in the precise manipulation of the properties (mechanical, optical, electrical, etc.), thereby leading to the successful development of polymer blends with a unique set of properties. The situation is far more challenging when one of the blend compo-nents is a semi-crystalline polymer due to several competing reactions, including phase separation, nucleation and crystal growth, ripening of crystal structure, etc. However, semi-crystalline polymers and their blends are quite extensively used in the automo-bile industry. Thereby, it is of industrial/academic interest to study the crystallization behavior of immiscible blend systems especially with dynamic asymmetry. This can be achieved by the addition of a high molecular weight additive to the semi-crystalline polymer matrix [2–4]. The influence of introducing low molecular weight additives [5–7] and fillers [8–10] have been extensively investigated. Even then, the effect of add-ing high molecular weight additives such as elastomers, block copolymers [11, 12] etc., to a semi-crystalline polymer matrix has not received significant attention.', 'The ease of processability, coupled with desirable characteristics/properties, makes polypropylene (iPP) an appealing thermoplastic for broad applications rang-ing from the automotive industry to biomedical industry [13] making it the best candidate for the present study. Even though the crystallization kinetics and mor-phology of iPP-based blends [14–19] and the influence of additives (especially those of low molecular weight) on the crystallization and morphology of semi-crystalline polymers have already been investigated [20, 21]. The influence of adding a high molecular weight polymer on segmental dynamics, crystallization kinetics and ther-mal stability remains unexplored and requires special attention. Rheological, mor-phological and mechanical properties of high molecular weight NR blended with PP have been extensively studied [22–24]. But an in-depth analysis of the thermal prop-erties of iPP-NR blends is not available especially, while using NR as a toughening agent. The very large difference in molecular weight between iPP and NR makes them a dynamically asymmetric system. Since the role of NR as a toughening agent for iPP was the main aim of present work, fillers were not used as this would inhibit the contribution of NR to morphology development and, in turn, mechanical proper-ties. The current manuscript ushers to provide fundamental insights into the crystal-lization kinetics, morphology development and thermal stability of a dynamic asym-metric blend with a semi-crystalline component.', 'The current research deals with subjecting the blends to different thermal his-tories to determine the glass transition temperature (Tg), melting temperature (Tm), and melting enthalpy (ΔHm) using DSC. Apart from these, isothermal crystalliza-tion experiments were carried out to determine the half-time of crystallization (t0.5) and the kinetic parameters, which include the Avrami exponent (n) and the overall rate of crystallization (K1/n). Besides, the spherulitic growth of the blend has been followed using polarizing optical microscopy (POM).', 'Experimental', 'Materials', 'iPP (Repol-H350 FG) was supplied by Reliance Industries Limited with melt flow index, (230 °C/2.16 kg) of 38 g/min and heat deflection temperature (455 kPa) of 104 °C.

To improve mixing efficiency, the high viscosity NR was reduced by masticating it for 5 min in a two-roll mill with a nip clearance of 3 mm and a friction ratio of 1.25:1 (20/15 rpm, back roll/front roll). Blends with different blend ratios of iPP and NR (100–0, 90–10, 80–20, 70–30 60–40 and 50–50) were melt-mixed using a Brabender Plastocorder.

The result obtained is shown in Fig. 2.', 'It can be observed that as the amount of NR increases, the ξ showed a gradual decrease which is in accordance with the morphology change observed using SEM. Gradual increases in the amount of NR result in a change from droplet-matrix to co-continuous type morphology. This is in exact correlation with calculated CRR values. In the case of the blend with 50%·w/w of NR, an increase in CRR can be observed due to phase inversion. The crystallization of a semi-crystalline polymer in a blend can be affected by its counterpart. Molecular structure and molecular weight of the components, blend composition, type and degree of dispersion for dif-ferent phases in the molten stage, phase interaction at the interface of the individ-ual homopolymers and crystallization conditions are some of the major factors that affect the crystallinity in the polymer. The crystallinity (χ) [28, 29] is given by,', '휒% =ΔHmΔH◦ m × Vf× 100,', 'where ΔHm and Vf are the enthalpy of fusion and volume fraction of iPP, respec-tively. The ΔH0m is the heat of fusion of 100% pure crystalline PP which was taken asiPP is 209 J·g−1. [30] The crystallinity increases with NR loading, reaches a maxi-mum of 30% w/w of NR and thereafter decreases (refer to Fig. 3). The decrease in ξ and increase in χ indicate that small fractions of NR aid the crystallization of iPP by serving as nucleating agents, and the amorphous fraction of iPP has weak van der Waal’s interaction with NR, with the interactions sensitive to NR loading. Figure 3 shows the melting curve for iPP–NR blend system (Table 2).', 'Endotherms for the second heating cycle were used to evaluate the melting behavior. This eliminates the influence of processing history on melting behavior. The melting temperature is almost the same in all blends (~ 163 °C). However, a small broadening of the melting peak can be observed, which may be due to the melting of different-sized crystals or disordered crystals formed by the addition of NR.', '@', '@', 'The endotherm obtained for iPP-NR blends after crystallization at selected crys-tallization temperatures (Tc) was used to calculate the equilibrium melting tempera-ture (Tm°) using Hoffman–Weeks Eq.

Plot of Tmº against blend composi-tion is shown in Fig. 4.', 'The trend for Tm° has wide implications for polymer blends. An increasing value for Tm° indicates that the crystalline fraction is compatible with the added amor-phous component. An increase in Tm° is rarely encountered. A decrease in Tm° indicates attractive interactions between the blend components. It can be observed from Fig. 4 that the Tm° for iPP–NR blend shows a decreasing trend indicating that the crystalline fraction of iPP is having an attractive interaction with NR. Figure 5 shows the crystallization of iPP–NR blend at a selected Tc of 130 °C.', 'It follows from Fig. 6 that the addition of NR influenced the crystallization ofiPP, and the rate of crystallization increased with the addition of NR. The broad-ened exotherm of neat iPP sharpens with NR loading, indicating favorable inter-action between iPP and NR. Neat iPP requires more time to crystallize than that of NR blended iPP, confirming the efficiency of NR as a nucleating agent. The isothermal crystallization studies were carried out to evaluate the crystallization kinetics for iPP–NR blends as a function of NR loading. The time taken for half the crystallinity to develop (t0.5) is recommended to remove the influence of the overall rate of crystallization on the phase boundaries of a heterogeneous system.

The reason for this is the change in morphology (from droplet-matrix type to co-continuous type), as discussed in the following section.', 'SEM analysis shows droplet-matrix type morphology with gradual change to co-continuous type as a function of NR loading, (50%·w/w NR loading onwards) as evidenced by the SEM images shown in Fig. 10.', 'Figure 11 displays the optical micrographs of spherulite growth at 130 °C at thecooling rate of 10 °C/min in neat iPP, and iPP–NR blend with magnification of 10X.', 'Figure 11a confirms the presence of a well-defined “Maltese cross [14]” coin-ciding with the principal axis of crystal and extinction direction of the polarizer/analyzer, indicating uniform crystal growth. Higher concentrations of NR exhibit co-continuous morphology, preventing the actual growth of iPP spherulites and disappearing Maltase cross for the spherulite developed in the iPP–NR 50–50 composition [37, 38].

Fig-ure 14a shows that neat iPP has single-step degradation with high thermal stabil-ity (decomposition onset of 385 °C), while 50% of degradation occurs at 474 °C. With the addition of NR to the iPP matrix, a gradual decrement of onset of degra-dation reaching up to 308 °C can be observed (50%∙w/w of NR). It is noteworthy that blends of iPP–NR exhibit two degradation steps, indicating a highly immiscible system, which is obvious from the DTG curves (Fig. 3).

The addition of NR to iPP produces a gradual change in morphology from droplet-matrix to co-continuous type, and this resulted in a predominant con-tribution to the crystallization kinetics of iPP and the mutual interaction between the blend components. Decrease in Tm° with NR loading, point to the existence of weak attractive interactions between the blend components. This is also reflected in the spherulite growth rate. Even though the blending of iPP with other polymers has been studied and reported quite extensively, the effect of dynamic asymmetry on thermal properties and morphology development remains unexplored.

2025-05-20 14:45:33 - WARNING: ['Advanced elasticity and biodegradability of bio‑based  copolyester elastomer achieved by the crystallization  inhibition of isosorbide and flexibility of 1,6‑hexanediol', 'Lisheng Tang1  · Xiaoyan He1  · Ran Huang1', 'Received: 8 July 2024 / Revised: 13 August 2024 / Accepted: 24 September 2024 /   Published online: 26 October 2024  © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024 The stability to against hydrolysis while maintaining excellent elasticity is one of the most challenging problems in the development of biodegradable and environ-mental-friendly polyester elastomer. While monomers of longer chain can provide higher stability, the high crystallinity and rigidity impair their application in fabri-cating elastomer. This work reported a star-crosslinked poly(butanediol-hexanediol-isosorbitol-itaconate-sebacate) elastomer synthesized by esterification and thermal curing. With the crystallization inhibition effect of isosorbide as a large and rigid monomer, and the flexibility of 1,6-hexanediol, the rigid (butanediol-itaconate-seba-cate) copolyester system is successfully transformed from plastic to be elastomer with lower Tm and Tg, much higher elongation at break, and smaller tensile modulus, and the biodegradability is also improved. The strategy is demonstrated to be effi-cient and may serve as a potential technique in the future development of biodegrad-able elastomers.', 'Abstract', 'Keywords Biodegradable · Copolyester elastomer · PBHIIS · Isosorbide ·Crystallization inhibition', 'Introduction', 'Because of its special qualities, elastomers—a type of polymer with a low modulus and high elasticity—can rapidly return to their initial form following the removal of an external force. Because of these qualities, they are indispensable in both daily life and the economy [1–4]. Elastomers have been the subject of ongoing research and development to improve their strength, stability, aging resistance, and wear resistance in order to fulfill the ever-increasing performance requirements. How-ever, these advantages make it harder to dispose of the waste products made from conventional elastomers, which pollutes the environment over time [5, 6]. However, the majority of elastomers are derived from poorly sustainable non-renewable fos-sil fuels. The creation of novel elastomers that are not dependent on fossil fuels has become highly demanded in recent times due to the immense strain imposed by car-bon emissions. Bio-based elastomers are a great way to reduce carbon emissions and conserve resources in the elastomer sector since they may be made from natural plants directly or by synthesizing them from bio-based monomers produced from biomass resources.', 'Due to excellent biodegradability, aliphatic polyester became a prominent area of research for environmentally-friendly products. Linear polyesters, such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA), polyglycolide acid (PGA), polycaprolactone (PCL), and their copol-ymers, have been extensively studied in the field of plastic for many years. And their industrial production is seeing tremendous growth [7–9]. Polyesters having a three-dimensional network have gained increasing interest, motivated by these lin-ear polymers [10, 11]. Like vulcanized rubber, the cross-linked network is formed by the incorporation of "star" monomers to create multi-branched chains, enabling the material to rapidly regain its shape when subjected to substantial deformation. Poly (glycerol sebacate) (PGS), polyoctyl citrate (POC), and their copolymers are the primary biodegradable polyester elastomers that have undergone substantial research. The pioneering work is the synthesis of PGS, an in-situ cross-linked poly-ester elastomer with a three-dimensional network structure and exceptional robust-ness, conducted by Langer et al. successfully synthesized in 2002 [10, 12]. In 2011, Zhang et al. firstly introduced chemically crosslinked polyester elastomer [13]. Sub-sequently, many other bio-based elastomers have been created [14, 15].', 'It is well known that monomers of longer chain are easier to be synthesized to be polyester with higher stability, due to the lower density of ester linkage. For exam-ple, PCL and PBS are commercially mature materials, which employ 4- or 6- car-bon chain monomer [16], while polyglycolide acid (PGA) with 2-carbon monomer is unstable to hydrolysis and its commercial application is very limited [17]. How-ever, on the other hand, when the goal of our research is to obtain elastomers, the high crystallinity and rigidity due to longer chains becomes a disadvantage. Hereby a technical difficulty arises, how to construct biodegradable polyester with decent stability, cross-linkage network, and sufficient elasticity? That is, we probably need longer chain monomers, multi-functional “star” monomer, and some component to lower the crystallinity.', 'In chemically crosslinked polyester elastomers, the glass transition temperature can be decreased and crystallization can be hindered by employing multicompo-nent copolymerization and including monomers with side groups, which in turn improves the elasticity [18, 19]. Particular monomers with side group, large vol-ume and/or rigid segment can play a crucial role in crystallization inhibition. Gao et al. [20] designed and synthesized biobased poly(1,4-butanediol/2,3-butanediol/succinic acid/iconocarboxylic acid) co-polyesters (PBBSI) with varying 2,3-butan-ediol content. The co-polyesters underwent a transformation from stiff plastics to flexible elastomers due to the alteration in the amount of 2,3-butanediol. Hu et al. [21] synthesized the elastomer poly(2,3-butanediol-co-1,4-butanediol-co-succinate) (PBBS) by introducing 2,3-butanedioic acid into PBS, whose elasticity can be there-after improved with the crystallization inhibition effect.', 'Isosorbide, as a bulky, rigid, and food and environment safe monomer, can be introduced into the copolyester for tuning the crystallization and thermal properties. Zhang et al. [22] reported a bio-based shape memory polymer for biomedical appli-cations, which employs butanediol, isosorbide, sebacate, and itaconate to achieve a series of cross-linked copolyesters with excellent shape-recovery property. However, this series of (PBISI) copolyesters were not elastomers in the room temperature. On the other hand, our group has focused on the development of biodegradable elasto-mers using the dual-crosslinking property of itaconic acid [19, 23]. Thus, it is inher-ently captivating to us that this system shall also possess exceptional potential to function as an elastomer with significant industrial utility. The absence of longer chain monomers with greater flexibility may be the crucial factor for elasticity.', 'In this work, we select sebacic acid, itaconic acid, butanediol, and hexanediol to synthesize stable copolyesters, with sebacic acid as the long-chain monomer, ita-conic acid as the chemically crosslinking site, and two diols, butanediol and hex-anediol, to reduce the regularity of the copolyester. Isosorbide is then introduced to the copolyester to prepare the biodegradable elastomer as PBHIIS. Linear chains of this two copolyesters are synthesized as so-called pre-PBHI(I)S, and a final ther-mal curing with initiator benzoyl peroxide (BPO) vulcanized the linear chains to be structural network. The scheme of this work is illustrated in Fig. 1. The chemical structure, thermal and mechanical properties, and biodegradability of the final prod-ucts were characterized.', 'Experimental', 'Reagents and materials', 'Itaconic acid (analytic grade), hexanediol (analytic grade), and butanediol (analytic grade) are purchased from Shandong Yousuo Chemical Technology Co., Ltd, China; isosorbide (analytic grade), sebacic acid (analytic grade), and methylhydroquinone (analytic grade) are purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd.

Additionally, polymerization inhibitors comprising of 0.05 wt.% methylhydroqui-none and 0.02 wt.% hydroquinone are added. The resulting mixture is then placed in an oil bath and heated to a temperature of 140 ℃ to facilitate melting. Mechani-cal stirring and nitrogen environment for protection are employed during the entire esterification, while gradually raising the temperature. The reaction proceeds 1 h each time the temperature increases by 10  ℃ within the range of 140 ℃–180 ℃, for a total duration of 5 h. Subsequently, evacuate the system gradually raise the tem-perature while operating under lower pressure to facilitate the condensation reac-tion.

The prepolymer is subjected to repeated dissolution flocculation using a mixture of dichloromethane and metha-nol, which effectively eliminates impurity. Additionally, the majority of the solvent is eliminated through the process of rotary evaporation. Subsequently, the substance is introduced into a vacuum oven set at a temperature of 50 ℃, where it undergoes vacuum drying until the solvent is entirely eliminated.', 'The initiator BPO of 1 wt.% is added into the prepolymers and subject it to a cur-ing process at a temperature of 130 ℃ for a duration of 20 min. We prepared three sets of polyester elastomers with varying percentages of isosorbitol components. Table 1 displays the molar ratios of the three combinations of raw ingredients and the corresponding names of the polyester elastomers.', 'Characterization', 'Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis was carried out to determine the number-average molecular weight (Mn), weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and poly dispersity index (PDI) (PL-GPC220, Agilent Technologies, USA). Tet-rahydrofuran was used as the eluent at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.', 'The FTIR (ATR mode) was characterized on Nicolet is 10 (Thermo Fisher Scien-tific, USA) with the scanning resolution of 4 \xadcm−1 over the wavelength range from 4000 to 650 \xadcm−1 for 32 times.', 'Proton (1H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were measured at room temperature on a 600 MHz Bruker AV-600 spectrometer in methyl sulfoxide, using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard.', 'Mechanical properties were measured according to ISO37-2011 on a PT-1166Z Universal testing machine (Dongguan perfect-group Instrument, China) at a cross-head speed of 50 mm/min at room temperature.

About 5–8 mg of the samples were placed into alumina crucibles and heated to 100 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min and kept for 5 min to eliminate previous thermal history, followed by cooling down to -50 °C and finally heating to 100 °C at a cooling/ heating rate of 10 °C/min.', 'The biodegradability of the PBH(I)S was characterized by composting accordingthe EN ISO standard [24].', 'Results and discussion', 'Chemical structure', 'The molecular weight of pre-polymer significantly influences the structure and prop-erties of the final cured product. Gel permeation chromatography is employed to examine the molecular weight of the prepolymers. The Mn, Mw, and PDI of pre-PBHI(I)S are summarized in Table 2. Note that all the synthesis were undertaken with the identical device, procedure and operator, therefore the significant difference of molecular weight among PBHIS and PBHIIS mainly reflects the synthesizabil-ity of themselves. And it accords to our expectation that large and rigid isosorbide cause a harder chain formation with lower Mn and Mw, and PBHIIS4 exhibits a bit higher molecular weight than PBHIIS2, but these two are in comparable level and can be considered as trivial difference.', '@', '@', 'Figure 2a shows the FTIR spectra of PBHIIS2 before and after curing, due to the presence of unsaturated itaconic acid, the peak of C = C stretching vibration is located at 1650 \xadcm−1. Moreover, it can be seen from the figure that the intensity of the C = C peak located near 1650 \xadcm−1 of the cured PBHIIS2 decreases sig-nificantly, which indicates that the C = C on the molecular chain acts as a reaction site for cross-linking during the curing. Figure 2b is the FTIR spectrum of various PBHI(I)S. The presence of an absorption peak representing ester carbonyl C = O near 1730 \xadcm−1 proves the occurrence of esterification, which results in the gen-eration of ester bonds in the molecular structure. The peak of ether bond C–O–C near 1095 \xadcm−1 is enhanced significantly from PBHIS to PBHIIS4, which obvi-ously agrees with the factor that only isosorbide contains C–O–C bond among all the monomers.', 'The chemical structure of pre-PBHI(I)S is further characterized using 1H NMR spectroscopy. The 1H NMR spectrum of pre-PBHI(I)S is shown in Fig. 3. Typical signals can be observed at 6.36 ppm, 5.75 ppm and 3.38 ppm corresponding to the \xadHm, \xadHm’ and \xadHn of the itaconic acid-based units, which indicates that the pendent double bonds, –C(= \xadCH2)–, can still be well preserved after the esterification and condensation reaction due to the inhibitory effect of the polymerization inhibitor. The peaks at 5.22 ppm, 5.18 ppm, 4.86 ppm and 4.51 ppm correspond to the \xadHa, \xadHa’, \xadHb and \xadHc of isosorbitol units. The peaks between 4.00 ppm to 4.30 ppm repre-sent the \xadHj and \xadHo of –CH2– in butanediol and hexanediol units. The peaks can be detected at 2.32 ppm corresponding to the \xadHf of the sebacic acid units. According to the results of 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 3a–c), the molar ratios of each unit are calcu-lated and listed in Fig. 3d. It indicates that the isosorbide component of raw mate-rial is increased, and the isosorbide segment in the synthesized molecular chain also increases. This further supports the above FTIR characterizations.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Thermal and mechanical property', 'The DSC results of various PBHI(I)S are shown in Fig. 4. The thermal properties such as glass transition temperature (Tg, °C), melting temperature (Tm, °C), melt-ing enthalpy (ΔHm, J/g), crystallization temperature (Tc, °C), and crystallization enthalpy (ΔHc, J/g) are summarized in Table 3. The Tg of PBHIIS exhibits a pro-gressive rise as the isosorbide concentration rise. This can be attributed to the incor-poration of rigid molecule isosorbide, which hinders the movement of the polyes-ter molecular chain. Nevertheless, the Tc and ΔHc of PBHIIS gradually decrease as the content of isosorbitol increases. This suggests that the presence of the cyclic structure of isosorbitol hindered the orderly arrangement of polyester molecular chains, thereby inhibiting the crystallization ability of PBHIIS. The Tg, Tm, and Tc of PBHIIS4 are lower than room temperature (25 °C). Therefore, PBHIIS4 exhibits a high elasticity at room temperature.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The mechanical properties of polyester elastomers are evaluated by tensile test. The stress–strain curves of various PBHI(I)S at room temperature are shown in Fig. 5, and the mechanical properties are summarized in Table 4. The PBHIS exhibits a notable tensile strength of 12.5 MPa and undergoes an obvious “necking” phenomenon dur-ing the tensile process, characterized by irreversible plastic deformation. The PBHIIS2 exhibits a crystallization temperature below room temperature, while its melting tem-perature surpasses room temperature. The polyester possesses excellent ductility due to the presence of a number of random molecular chains. Additionally, a small portion of crystals act as physical crosslinking agents, enhancing the material’s strength and elon-gation at break. PBHIIS2 has both exceptional tensile strength and remarkable elonga-tion at the point of fracture due to the presence of physical cross-linking and reinforce-ment from a limited number of crystals. The PBHIIS4 is a fully disordered polymer that does not form crystals at normal room temperature, and its stress–strain curves exhibit almost linear behavior. In the case of PBHIIS, the strength and modulus of the material decline dramatically as the amount of isosorbide rises. However, the elonga-tion at break grows significantly, with PBHIIS4 even reaching an elongation at break of 846.8%. This suggests that both the composition of monomers with side groups and the specific type of monomers with side groups are important factors in determining the mechanical properties of copolyesters. In particular, isosorbide as monomer is an excel-lent option for regulating the mechanical properties of polyester elastomers.', '@', '@', 'Biodegradability', 'Figure 6 shows the histogram of the degradation weight loss of PBHI(I)S with degrada-tion time at 50 °C and in a compost bin. From the degradation weight loss histograms, it can be seen that all the polyester elastomers synthesized in this work have excellent biodegradable properties, and almost all of them can be completely degraded in about 1 month. The degradation rate is relatively slow in the pre-composting stage probably due to factors such as microbial attachment, and the degradation occurred more and more rapidly as the polyester elastomers are gradually exposed to more degradable sites with the passage of time. The addition of isosorbide increases the hydrophilic-ity of PBHIIS, making it more susceptible to water and microbial "attack" and easier to degrade. The hydrolysable ester bonds in copolyester elastomers are responsible for their excellent biodegradability, and the degradation rate of copolyester elastomers can be modulated to a certain extent by the amount and type of monomers used in the syn-thesis system.', '@', '@', 'Conclusion', 'Biodegradable polyester elastomers, PBHIIS, were successfully prepared from bio-based dibasic acids and diols by direct melt polycondensation and introduc-ing the large and rigid monomer isosorbide to reduce the chemical and geometri-cal regularity of the molecular chain.', 'By adjusting the molar ratios of the isosorbide monomer, it was found that, with the increase in the amount of the side group-containing monomers, the crys-tallization of the polyesters gradually weakened, the deformation of the poly-esters in the tensile process shifted from mainly plastic to elastic deformation, and there was a tendency to accelerate the rate of the polyester’s biodegradation. Comparing to PBHIS and PBHIIS2, the PBHIIS4 has a Tm (24.53 °C) close to room temperature, and a significant elongation at break of 846.8%, which is more than 11 times of the PBHIS. These findings certified that the isosorbide is a suc-cessful component in developing polyester elastomers and we hope it may serve as potential tool in the future research.', 'Acknowledgements The National Key Research and Development Program China (2022YFC2009500), Guangdong Provincial Science and Technology Program (2023A0505050146), the Medical Engineering Fund of Fudan University (yg2022-008).', 'Author contributions R.H. supervised and coordinated project; R.H. and L.T. designed research; L.T. performed research; L.T., and X.H. analyzed data; R.H., X.H. and L.T. acquired funding and resource; and R.H. and L.T. wrote paper.', 'Data availability The main data generated or analyzed to support the conclusion during this study are included in this published article.
