Moreover, the dilution condition should be applied to suppress the concurrent chain extension. In consequence, this bimolecular process is now recognized as a less attractive choice for the preparation of cyclic polymers in practice (Scheme 1A).', '@', '@', 'A significantly improved means by an alternative unimolecular process has subsequently been introduced to prepare cyclic polymers (Scheme 1B). It was first demonstrated by using an asymmetrically functional telechelic precursor, a-acetal-u-styryl polystyrene,7 and the subsequent end-to-end polymer cyclization through the deprotection/activation treatment. This unimolecular process with asymmetrically functional telechelic precursors has been extended by employing alternative pairs of the reactive groups. Thus, an a-amino-u-carboxyl polystyrene and poly(tert-butyl acrylate) were prepared through a living polymerization using an initiator having a protected amino group, followed by the end-capping reaction to introduce a carboxylic group.8 The resulting asymmetric telechelic precursor underwent, after the deprotection, an intramolecular amidation reaction to give a ring polymer product effectively. Alternatively, an a-(furan-pro-tected)-maleimide-u-cyclopentadienylpoly(methylmethacry-late) and poly(tert-butyl acrylate) were prepared through the ATRP using a protected maleimide initiator and the subsequent introduction of a cyclopentadienyl group at the living end with the nickelocene methodology.9 The obtained asymmetric tele-chelic precursor was subjected to the heat treatment to cause the spontaneous deprotection followed by an intramolecular Diels–Alder addition reaction to give a ring polymer product effectively.9 It is notable, however, that these processes using telechelic precursors having potentially reactive groups require multistep protection/deprotection treatments.', 'A versatile unimolecular process has recently been introduced by employing a click reaction using asymmetrically functional telechelic polystyrene having an alkyne and an azide group.10 The introduction of these two functional groups at the polymer chain-ends could be performed conveniently, and they can react with each other upon the addition of a Cu catalyst.11 Therefore, this click polymer cyclization has been applied to prepare such functional ring polymers, as poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide)12,13and poly(caprolactone)14 as well as poly(valerolactone)15 to elucidate their topology-effect on phase transition, and on biodegradation, respectively, detailed in the later section. This unimolecular click process has also been employed to construct complex cyclic structures, either having multiple polymer segment components16 or having multicyclic as well as cyclic/ linear hybrid polymer segments.17 On the other hand, the bimo-lecular click process using an azide-ended bifunctional telechelic precursor and a bifunctional alkyne compound as a linking reagentproceedslesseffectivelythantheunimolecular counterpart.18', 'Another effective unimolecular process has been developed using symmetrically functional telechelic precursors, which are readily obtainable through a direct end-capping reaction of living bifunctional polymers (Scheme 1C).18–23 Thus, telechelic poly(tetrahydrofuran), poly(acrylic ester) and poly(isobutene) having olefinic end groups were prepared through the relevant living polymerization followed by the end-capping reaction. The subsequent metathesis condensation, i.e., metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC), in the presence of a Grubbs catalyst pro-ceeded effectively to give the corresponding ring polymers in high yields even under dilution.18–20 This MPC process has further been applied for the practical synthesis of amphiphilic cyclic block copolymers21 as well as of multi-cyclic polymers.22,23 This unimolecular process using symmetrically functional telechelic precursors has been extended by alternative telechelic precursors having either alkyne groups for Glaser condensation or having bromobenzyl groups for a radical coupling process.24,25', 'Ring polymers are obtainable alternatively through a direct ring-expansion polymerization, in which the successive insertion of monomers into a cyclic initiator proceeds to form a ring polymer structure (Scheme 1D). This process does not require dilution in contrast to the end-to-end polymer cyclization process by linear polymer precursors, while a reactive initiator fragment is inherently included in the final ring polymer structure. Thus until recently, the ring-expansion process has been considered as a less practical means, since it is not an easy task to maintain the ring topology of the product while eliminating the initiator residues.26', 'A number of new processes have recently been developed to address this problem in the ring-expansion polymerization (Scheme 2). Thus, a new Ru catalyst bearing a cyclic ligand containing the Ru-alkylidene unit has been introduced and applied for the ring-expansion polymerization of cyclic olefins such as 1,5-cyclooctadiene or cyclooctene.27 During the chain-growth process, the chain transfer to the Ru-alkylidene unit took place to eliminate the initiator complex, and consequently a ring polybutadiene or a ring poly(cyclooctene) free of the catalyst fragment, respectively, is produced. The obtained ring poly(cyclooctene)wasthenhydrogenatedtogivearing polyethylene, showing distinctive properties in comparison with commercial linear polyethylenes (Scheme 2A).27,28 It is notable, at the same time, that the random nature of this chain transfer process inherently causes the broadening of the molecular weight distribution of the product. This process has now been applied with a bulky, dendronized monomer to construct a ring nano-object directly observable by atomic force microscopy (AFM).29', 'More recently, a new N-heterocyclic carbene initiator was introduced for the ring-expansion polymerization of lactones or lactide to form ring polyesters or polylactide, respectively (Scheme 2B).30,31 Remarkably, the obtained ring polymers possess narrow molecular weight distributions through the elimination of the initiator fragment after the quantitative consumption of the monomer, in contrast to the metathesis ring-expansion process shown before.28 By exploiting the living character, this technique has subsequently been applied for the synthesis of ring block polypeptoids and of complex topological polymers having a ring with many branches, i.e., jellyfish poly-mers.32,33 A further development of the ring-expansion process would provide a wider variety of chemical structures in ring polymers by broadening the choice of monomer types.', 'The combination of the classical ring-expansion polymeriza-tion process, in which the initiator fragment is included within the ring polymer structure, with the end-to-end polymer cycli-zation process could provide a new effective means for ring polymers having, in particular, large sizes (Scheme 2C).34 Thus, a ring poly(caprolactone) having short photocrosslinkable block segments was prepared through a sequential living ring-expan-sion polymerization using a cyclic stannate initiator. The subsequent irradiation under dilution caused the intramolecular covalent linking of the two short segments. The subsequent removal of the stannate group produced a chemically stable ring polymer product, though the exact chemical structure of the linking units is obscure.34', '@', '@', 'By employing this methodology, a high-molecular weight ring poly(chloroethyl vinyl ether) was prepared and was subjected to the grafting-onto reaction using a living polystyrene, to form a densely grafted large ring polymer product as a nanoobject, which was directly observable by the AFM.35,36 On the other hand, the AFM showed a large fraction of uncyclized, linear polymer components remained in the crude cyclization products, revealing the inherent difficulty of the end-to-end cyclization of polymer precursors of high molecular weights. It is remarkable, moreover, that a small portion of nanoobjects corresponding to complex ring polymers having tadpole, 8-shaped, catenated and knotted forms were also identified. This showed, for the first time, that not only single-cyclic but also various complex cyclic polymer topologies are indeed produced through the polymer cyclization process, as previously shown in DNA systems.37', 'An electrostatic self-assembly and covalent fixation (ESA-CF) process has been introduced for the effective synthesis of not only cyclic but also functionalized cyclic and multicyclic polymers, where linear or star telechelic polymers having cyclic ammonium salt groups accompanying small or polymeric plurifunctional carboxylate counteranions are employed as key precursors (Scheme 1E).38–40 Various telechelic polymers have been conve-niently prepared through the relevant living polymerization fol-lowed by the end-capping/end-conversion technique. The choice of such particular types of cyclic ammonium salt end groups as five- and six-membered cyclic ammonium, i.e., N-phenyl-pyrrolidinium and N-phenylpiperidinium salt groups, respec-tively, is of a crucial importance in the ESA-CF process (Scheme 3).41 The former undergoes upon heating a selective ring-opening reaction by a carboxylate counteranion to form an amino ester group through the nucleophilic attack exclusively at the N-adjacent ring (endo) position. On the other hand, the latter having unstrained six-membered cyclic ammonium salt groups gives a chemically more stable, simple ester group through the nucleophilic attack at the alternative N-adjacent (exo) position, to eliminate N-phenylpiperidine.', 'And in the electrostatic polymer self-assembly, the cations at the end of the telechelics and the anions in the carboxylates counteranions always balance the charges. Upon the dilution, the self-assembly tends to dissociate into one having the smallest number of polymer components by keeping the balance of the charges (Scheme 4). Thus, when a self-assembly comprised of a linear telechelic precursor, typically poly(THF), having cyclic ammonium salt groups accompanying either a dicarboxylate or a tetracarboxylate counteranion was heated at dilution, the selective ring-opening reaction of the cyclic ammonium groups took place to produce single-cyclic (ring) or dicyclic (8-shaped) polymerproducts,respectively,inhighyields.38,42Ring poly(THF)s having the molecular weights of up to 10 000, cor-responding to the ring size of as high as 700 atoms, were obtainable and characterized unequivocally by the MALDI-TOF mass technique. Furthermore, the ESA-CF process with dynamic equilibrium nature has been exploited to construct various multicyclic as well as cyclic-linear hybrid polymer topologies (Scheme 5).6', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Moreover, ring polymers possessing the prescribed functional groups at the designated positions, i.e., kyklo-telechelics and cyclic macromonomer, have also been prepared by employing telechelic precursors possessing such functional groups as hydroxyl, olefinic, acetylenic, and azide groups at the designated, typically a center, position by using the relevant initiator, or by introducing functional linking reagents.43 They were subse-quently applied to construct more complex polymer topologies either through the covalent linkage or even through the non-covalent, mechanical linkage uniquely formed by threading with ring polymer units.44,45 It was also shown that network polymers formed from cyclic polymer precursors exhibited unique gel properties compared with conventional gels obtained with linear/ branched polymer precursors.46 Moreover, the topological conversion of polymers between ring/linear and even between single-cyclic/dicyclic topologies has now been achieved.45,47,48', 'By the combination of the ESA-CF protocol with selective covalent linking chemistry, a wide variety of multi-cyclic as well as cyclic-linear conjugated polymers have been synthesized.49 In particular, the combination of the ESA-CF process with the metathesis condensation and with the click process has now been revealed as a versatile means to construct a variety of complex multicyclic polymer topologies of fused-, spiro- and bridged forms (Scheme 6).50 Both the functional ring polymer precursors and thecovalentlylinkedmulticyclicpolymerproductwere unequivocally characterized by means of a series of spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques including MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy and SEC. As shown in Fig. 1, for a typical example, the structure of the polymer products having complex multicyclic topologies is convincingly demonstrated. The ESA-CF process has further been applied for the effective synthesis of topologi-cally unique polymer catenanes comprised of large polymer rings51 through the two orthogonal non-covalent interactions, namely the electrostatic and the hydrogen-bond interactions (Scheme 5).45', '@', '@', '3.Topology effects by cyclic polymers: depleting the chain-ends and beyond', 'In contrast to linear or branched polymer topologies, ring polymer topologies are uniquely defined by their absence of the chain ends.3,5 As recognized by the typical case of glass transition temperature (Tg), the topology effect of ring polymers is thus arisen from the depletion of the end-groups of polymer segments. Thus, the Tg of ring polymers is higher than the linear counter-part, until the polymer chain length becomes long enough to diminish the contribution of the chain end. On the contrary, the hydrodynamic volume or the melt viscosity of ring polymers is inherently smaller than their linear counterparts irrespective of their chain lengths. This indicates the distinctive conception in the topology effect by ring polymers. The latter is regarded as an inherent topology effect by ring polymers, while the former as the depletion effect of the polymer chain ends. Nevertheless, the elimination of the chain ends of polymer molecules inevitably leads to the formation of cyclic constructions to bring the topology effect, now drawing increasing interests to discover unusual properties and functions in polymer materials covering mechanical, thermal, electric, photonic and bio-related applica-tions either in bulk or at surface. From an experimental point of view, moreover, further developments are awaited to provide ring polymers possessing high molecular weights with guaran-teed purity, since the mixing of even small amount of linear counterpartmightcauseinconclusiveorevenerroneous conclusions on the topology effect by ring polymers.', '4.Topology effects on basic polymer properties: simulations and experiments from simple to complex cyclic polymers', 'Basic characteristics of single-cyclic (ring) homopolymers either in solution or bulk, in static or dynamic states, have extensively been studied and documented relevantly.3 Therefore, recent studies have elaborated either on specific polymers of practical importance like polyethylenes,52 on specific chain characteristics like semiflexible to stiff nature,53 or on multicomponent polymer systemstypicallyblockcopolymers.54Notably,moreover, theory and simulation studies have increasingly focused on multi-cyclic complex polymers, obviously promoted by synthetic developments on complex topological polymers.55–57 Unique topological polymer properties envisaged by the simulation studies are now to be verified experimentally using relevant topological polymers. Indeed, a collaborative simulation and experimental study on the liquid chromatography study has been conducted on multi-cyclic polymers, and could provide a basis for the purification and the characterization of polymers having complex topologies.58', '@', '@', 'The diffusion behavior is of particular interest in view of the topology effects on polymer molecules, since the self-diffusion of linear and branched polymers follows the reptation mechanism, a snake-like translational motion, in which the polymer chain ends tend to command the motion of their in-chain segments.59Cyclic polymers are unique, on the other hand, in the absence of chain ends, and their non-reptation dynamics has been a subject of both theory/simulation and experimental studies.60', 'A single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy is a unique means to observe directlythe motion of single polymer molecules.61 Thus, the ESA-CF process was applied with mono- and bifunctional telechelic poly(THF) precursors having N-phenylpiperidinium (six-membered ring) groups possessing a perylene dicarboxylate counteranion, to produce ring and linear poly(THF)s having a perylene unit applicable to the single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy measurement (Scheme 7).62', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The subsequent single-molecule imaging was conducted to observe the real-time motion of individual polymer molecules. The video-recording of the motion of single-molecule fluores-cence images, followed by the computational analysis could provide the position and trajectory of the object on the x–y plane as shown in Fig. 2. The histograms of the distribution of the individual diffusion constant were subsequently obtained from large enough datasets of these consecutive images. Upon the statistical analysis of the distribution patterns, a bimodal diffu-sion mechanism was disclosed for ring polymers, corresponding to either threaded or non-threaded conditions in a linear mole-cule matrix. In contrast, the unimodal diffusion was indicated for the linear counterpart (Fig. 3).', 'As shown above, the significant topology effects could be envisaged in polymer properties involving their diffusion process. In this respect, the crystallization dynamics is of a considerable interest since the diffusion and the conformational trans-formation of polymer molecules could dictate the folding and packing of polymer segments in the crystal lattice. To elucidate the topology effect in the crystallization process, a defect-free ring poly(THF) was prepared together with the linear counterpart having the precisely relevant chemical structure.63 Thus, a living bifunctional poly(THF) was terminated with sodium allyloxide to give a telechelic precursor having allyl end groups. The subsequent metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC) with a Grubbs catalyst under dilution, followed by the hydrogenation of the unsaturated linking group afforded a defect-free ring poly(THF), consisting exclusively of oxytetramethylene units (Scheme 8). The isothermal crystallization experiments showed the slower crystallization rate for ring poly(THF)s ascribed to their topologically constrained conformation (Fig. 4). Moreover,', '@', '@', '@', '@ distinctive crystal morphologies are produced, in particular a banded structure in the spherulites exclusively for the ring poly (THF) but not for the linear counterpart. The crystallization kinetics of ring poly(3-caprolactone)s has recently been reported by several groups.64 The faster crystallization rate was observed for ring polymers than the linear counterpart in contrast to the case of poly(THF), and was ascribed to the higher diffusion of ring polymers than their linear counterparts.64', '@', '@', '@', '@', '5.Topology effects by ring polymers in self-assemblies', 'The topology effects by ring polymers could be amplified in their assembled states rather than in their individually separated forms. Therefore, micelles formed by ring polymers should be of a remarkable interest. Thus, a series of micelles were prepared with amphiphilic cyclic AB block copolymers, comprised of eitherpoly(butyleneoxide)/poly(ethyleneoxide)orpoly (propylene oxide)/poly(ethylene oxide), together with their linear AB, linear ABA block copolymer counterparts.65–67 The cyclic block copolymer employed in this study was prepared by a bimolecular process using the hydroxy-terminated linear block copolymer and dichloromethane as a linking reagent in the presence of KOH, to form an acetal linking unit (Scheme 9A).', 'The critical micelle concentration (cmc) of the micelle with the cyclic AB block copolymer was similar to or marginally smaller than those with the linear ABA counterparts. On the contrary, the corresponding micelle with the linear AB counterpart showed a significantly smaller cmc. Moreover, the association number (Nw), thermodynamic radius (rt), and hydrodynamic radius (rh) of the micelle with the cyclic AB block copolymers and with the linear ABA counterparts were comparable to each other, but distinctively smaller than those with the linear AB counterparts. These results are consistent with the geometric estimation of the size of the micelles, corresponding to the Nw, rt, and rh, which is dependent on the continuous chain length of the hydrophobic segment in the block copolymers. And, those in the cyclic AB and the linear ABA block copolymers are estimated as a half of that in the linear AB counterpart employed in this study. Moreover, the cyclic AB block copolymer tends to constitute a stiff hairpin-like conformation, resulting in a slightly larger hydrophobic core within the micelle compared to that with the linear ABA coun-terpart having free chain ends. The enthalpy of micellization (DmicH�) was also smaller with the cyclic AB block copolymer than that with the corresponding linear ABA counterpart, presumably because the segmental flip-flop is inhibited in the micelle with the former, in contrast to the motional freedom by the latter having free chain ends. This also agrees with the smaller entropy of micellization (DmicS�) with the cyclic AB block copolymer than with the linear counterpart.', '@', '@', 'More recently, a significant topology effect has been revealed in the thermal stability of the micelle formed with cyclic AB block copolymers in comparison with the linear ABA and even with the linear AB counterparts.68 Notably, a variety of relevant cyclic lipids, thus a type of surfactants, have been discovered in the cell membrane of thermophilic archaea, single-cell microorganisms, surviving in the hostile environment of very high-temperatures located at hot springs and submarine volcanoes.69 Thus, an amphiphilic cyclic AB block copolymer, comprised of poly(butyl acrylate)/poly(ethylene oxide) segments, was prepared. The unimolecular, metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC) process was employed using a linear ABA block copolymer precursor having olefinic end groups (Scheme 9B).21', 'The obtained cyclic and the relevant linear block copolymers were allowed to form the corresponding micelles, in which their cmc’s and the number-average hydrodynamic volumes (Dh) were measured to be closely comparable to each other (Fig. 5).68 The size and morphology of the micelles with either block copolymers were directly observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 6) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 6) to show commonly flower-like spherical shapes possessing the consistent diameters determined by DLS (Scheme 10).', 'Remarkably, the thermal stability of the micelles was drasti-cally enhanced using the cyclic block copolymer. Thus, the corresponding micelle solutions were heated from 20�C in a stepwise fashion (Fig. 7), and the micelle with the linear ABA block copolymer became turbid at around 25 �C, while that with the cyclic AB counterpart was stable till above 70 �C.68', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Based on the large deviation of the clouding point (Tc) among the micelles either solely with cyclic or with linear block copol-ymers, the tuning of the Tc of the micelle was achieved by the coassembly of both the linear and cyclic block copolymers.68Thus, the Tc was systematically altered along with the relative contents of the cyclic and the linear block copolymer compo-nents in the micelle, as shown in Fig. 7.68 This topology effect will be utilized to design temperature-responsive devices encapsu-lating and releasing appropriate components in and from the micelle. In particular, the topology-based polymer materials design should be suitable for human body-related applications including drug delivery system, food, and cosmetics, for which the modification of chemical structure and molecular weight mightinducereasonableconcernoverthetoxicityand biocompatibility.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '6.Topology effects by functional ring polymers having programmed chemical structures', 'Along with the introduction of new synthetic methodologies, an increasing variety of functional ring polymers and oligomers have become obtainable to exploit their topology effects. A number of recent studies are presented in this section, covering a diverse field either by conjugated cyclic oligomers,70 by photo-responsive ring polymers,71,72 by biodegradable ring polyesters,14by temperature-responsive ring polymers,12,13or by pharmaco-logically functional ring polymers.73', 'Conjugated polymers and oligomers have currently been extensively studied primarily due to their potential for diverse electronic and photonic applications.74 Ring-shaped conjugated polymers and oligomers have attracted particular interests as a prototype of the molecularly fabricated electric circuit, since the circulation of electrons/holes might be induced along the ‘‘endless’’ conjugated segments. A wide variety of conjugated ring oligomers possessing the increasing numbers of unsaturated groups have thus been prepared to test their electrochemical properties.70 Fully conjugated large ring polymers, on the other hand, have still been an elusive synthetic challenge. It is notable, moreover, that a twisted, Moebius stripe-like conjugated olig-omer has attracted considerable interests because of their unusual non-H€uckel aromaticity, in contrast to the conventional H€uckel-type aromaticity which is dependent on its planar geometry by conjugated units.75', 'Photo-response behaviors could be influenced by polymer topologies of either ring or linear forms. Thus, a ring polymer having photo-responsive azobenzene units in the main chain was prepared through the bimolecular end-to-end cyclization via click chemistry.71 Upon the irradiation of UV light, both the trans-to-cis and the cis-to-trans isomerization proceeded slightly faster by the ring polymer in comparison with the linear counterpart. This behavior was attributed to the higher topo-logical constraint of the former than the latter counterpart.71 As another example, a ring polystyrene having two photoactive groups, namely fluorene and anthracene units, was prepared through the bimolecular process using a living bifunctional polystyrene produced with an initiator having a fluorene unit and a linking reagent having an anthracene unit.72 The fluo-rescent behavior of the obtained ring polymer was subsequently studied to show the intramolecular energy migration between the two chromophores.72', 'Naturally occurring ring polymers, such as cyclic DNAs, cyclic peptides as well as cyclic polysaccharides,3 and multi-cyclic counterparts like cyclotides,76 are known to exhibit higher stability against biologically induced decomposition. In this relevance, the topology effect of aliphatic biodegradable poly-esters on their decomposition behavior has been investigated.14Thus, ring poly(caprolactone) was prepared through the unim-olecular click polymer cyclization using the corresponding precursor having an azide and an alkyne group. The higher hydrolytic stability was then observed in comparison with the linear counterparts.14 Notably, moreover, such biodegradable ring polyesters by poly(valerolactone) and by poly(lactide) were also prepared.15,30,31,77', 'Temperature-responsivepropertiesofpoly(N-iso-propylacrylamide), poly(NIPAM), have extensively been studied for their eventual uses in the controlled release devices and for the cell–sheet applications.78 The two groups recently reported the topology effects by ring poly(NIPAM)s.12,13 Thus, the two groups prepared linear poly(NIPAM) precursors having alkyne and azide end groups either by a reversible addition–fragmen-tation chain transfer (RAFT) or by an atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) technique, and the unimolecular click process was commonly applied for the subsequent polymer cyclization. The cloud point (TCP) of the obtained ring poly(NIPAM) by one group was several degrees higher than that of the corresponding linear counterpart. In addition, they observed that the phase transition by the ring polymers took place distinctively slower upon heating.12 Another group, on the other hand, observed the ring poly(NIPAM) showing a few degrees lower TCP against the linear counterpart at the higher solution concentration, while higher at the lower solution concentration. Furthermore, they reported the smaller enthalpy change (DH) during the phase transition with the ring poly (NIPAM). These results were accounted for by the suppression of the hydrogen bond interaction between the ring poly(NIPAM) with water molecules due to their topological constraints in comparison with the flexible linear counterpart having free chain ends.13', 'A pharmacological application of ring polymers has recently been demonstrated by elucidating the filtration/elimination mechanism of a kidney through its nanoporous channel.73 Thus, it was anticipated that the ring polymer could remain longer in a body than the linear counterpart, since the former should be reluctant to transform its conformation into a folded shape to traverse through the nanoporous channels of the kidney.73 To test this topology effect, a series of linear and cyclic poly(capro-lactone)s having poly(ethylene glycol) graft segments and having phenolic functionalities for radiolabeling by 125I were prepared. The lower secretion into urine and in turn the higher accumu-lation in various organs was indeed confirmed with the ring polymer having an appropriate molecular weight, corresponding to its hydrodynamic volume.73 These findings may provide new design methodologies for drug carriers and imaging agents via the topology-based control of a blood circulation time.', '7.Conclusions and future perspectives', 'In this review, we have shown a variety of recent achievements in topological polymer chemistry, to focus on novel polymer properties and functions uniquely revealed by ring polymers. The topology effects, in particular by ring polymers have now offered unique opportunities in polymer materials design unattainable by other means. A viable promise for the practical utilization of the topology effect undoubtedly includes the modification of any existing polymeric materials dependent mostly on linear poly-mers, inflicting little concern on chemical toxicity and environ-mentalpollution.Furthermore,broaderopportunitiesof topology effects by not only single-cyclic but also multi-cyclic polymers are expected in polymer chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, and materials science.', 'Acknowledgements', 'We thank Sekisui Chemical Grant Program for Research on Manufacturing Based on Learning from Nature (Y.T.), The Mitsubishi Foundation (Y.T.), Tokuyama Science Foundation (T.Y.), CASIO Science Promotion Foundation (T.Y.), The Japan Securities Scholarship Foundation (T.Y.), The Kurata Memorial Hitachi Science and Technology Foundation (T.Y.), and Yazaki Memorial Foundation for Science and Technology for financial support.

Moreover, the dilution condition should be applied to suppress the concurrent chain extension. In consequence, this bimolecular process is now recognized as a less attractive choice for the preparation of cyclic polymers in practice (Scheme 1A).', '@', '@', 'A significantly improved means by an alternative unimolecular process has subsequently been introduced to prepare cyclic polymers (Scheme 1B). It was first demonstrated by using an asymmetrically functional telechelic precursor, a-acetal-u-styryl polystyrene,7 and the subsequent end-to-end polymer cyclization through the deprotection/activation treatment. This unimolecular process with asymmetrically functional telechelic precursors has been extended by employing alternative pairs of the reactive groups. Thus, an a-amino-u-carboxyl polystyrene and poly(tert-butyl acrylate) were prepared through a living polymerization using an initiator having a protected amino group, followed by the end-capping reaction to introduce a carboxylic group.8 The resulting asymmetric telechelic precursor underwent, after the deprotection, an intramolecular amidation reaction to give a ring polymer product effectively. Alternatively, an a-(furan-pro-tected)-maleimide-u-cyclopentadienylpoly(methylmethacry-late) and poly(tert-butyl acrylate) were prepared through the ATRP using a protected maleimide initiator and the subsequent introduction of a cyclopentadienyl group at the living end with the nickelocene methodology.9 The obtained asymmetric tele-chelic precursor was subjected to the heat treatment to cause the spontaneous deprotection followed by an intramolecular Diels–Alder addition reaction to give a ring polymer product effectively.9 It is notable, however, that these processes using telechelic precursors having potentially reactive groups require multistep protection/deprotection treatments.', 'A versatile unimolecular process has recently been introduced by employing a click reaction using asymmetrically functional telechelic polystyrene having an alkyne and an azide group.10 The introduction of these two functional groups at the polymer chain-ends could be performed conveniently, and they can react with each other upon the addition of a Cu catalyst.11 Therefore, this click polymer cyclization has been applied to prepare such functional ring polymers, as poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide)12,13and poly(caprolactone)14 as well as poly(valerolactone)15 to elucidate their topology-effect on phase transition, and on biodegradation, respectively, detailed in the later section. This unimolecular click process has also been employed to construct complex cyclic structures, either having multiple polymer segment components16 or having multicyclic as well as cyclic/ linear hybrid polymer segments.17 On the other hand, the bimo-lecular click process using an azide-ended bifunctional telechelic precursor and a bifunctional alkyne compound as a linking reagentproceedslesseffectivelythantheunimolecular counterpart.18', 'Another effective unimolecular process has been developed using symmetrically functional telechelic precursors, which are readily obtainable through a direct end-capping reaction of living bifunctional polymers (Scheme 1C).18–23 Thus, telechelic poly(tetrahydrofuran), poly(acrylic ester) and poly(isobutene) having olefinic end groups were prepared through the relevant living polymerization followed by the end-capping reaction. The subsequent metathesis condensation, i.e., metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC), in the presence of a Grubbs catalyst pro-ceeded effectively to give the corresponding ring polymers in high yields even under dilution.18–20 This MPC process has further been applied for the practical synthesis of amphiphilic cyclic block copolymers21 as well as of multi-cyclic polymers.22,23 This unimolecular process using symmetrically functional telechelic precursors has been extended by alternative telechelic precursors having either alkyne groups for Glaser condensation or having bromobenzyl groups for a radical coupling process.24,25', 'Ring polymers are obtainable alternatively through a direct ring-expansion polymerization, in which the successive insertion of monomers into a cyclic initiator proceeds to form a ring polymer structure (Scheme 1D). This process does not require dilution in contrast to the end-to-end polymer cyclization process by linear polymer precursors, while a reactive initiator fragment is inherently included in the final ring polymer structure. Thus until recently, the ring-expansion process has been considered as a less practical means, since it is not an easy task to maintain the ring topology of the product while eliminating the initiator residues.26', 'A number of new processes have recently been developed to address this problem in the ring-expansion polymerization (Scheme 2). Thus, a new Ru catalyst bearing a cyclic ligand containing the Ru-alkylidene unit has been introduced and applied for the ring-expansion polymerization of cyclic olefins such as 1,5-cyclooctadiene or cyclooctene.27 During the chain-growth process, the chain transfer to the Ru-alkylidene unit took place to eliminate the initiator complex, and consequently a ring polybutadiene or a ring poly(cyclooctene) free of the catalyst fragment, respectively, is produced. The obtained ring poly(cyclooctene)wasthenhydrogenatedtogivearing polyethylene, showing distinctive properties in comparison with commercial linear polyethylenes (Scheme 2A).27,28 It is notable, at the same time, that the random nature of this chain transfer process inherently causes the broadening of the molecular weight distribution of the product. This process has now been applied with a bulky, dendronized monomer to construct a ring nano-object directly observable by atomic force microscopy (AFM).29', 'More recently, a new N-heterocyclic carbene initiator was introduced for the ring-expansion polymerization of lactones or lactide to form ring polyesters or polylactide, respectively (Scheme 2B).30,31 Remarkably, the obtained ring polymers possess narrow molecular weight distributions through the elimination of the initiator fragment after the quantitative consumption of the monomer, in contrast to the metathesis ring-expansion process shown before.28 By exploiting the living character, this technique has subsequently been applied for the synthesis of ring block polypeptoids and of complex topological polymers having a ring with many branches, i.e., jellyfish poly-mers.32,33 A further development of the ring-expansion process would provide a wider variety of chemical structures in ring polymers by broadening the choice of monomer types.', 'The combination of the classical ring-expansion polymeriza-tion process, in which the initiator fragment is included within the ring polymer structure, with the end-to-end polymer cycli-zation process could provide a new effective means for ring polymers having, in particular, large sizes (Scheme 2C).34 Thus, a ring poly(caprolactone) having short photocrosslinkable block segments was prepared through a sequential living ring-expan-sion polymerization using a cyclic stannate initiator. The subsequent irradiation under dilution caused the intramolecular covalent linking of the two short segments. The subsequent removal of the stannate group produced a chemically stable ring polymer product, though the exact chemical structure of the linking units is obscure.34', '@', '@', 'By employing this methodology, a high-molecular weight ring poly(chloroethyl vinyl ether) was prepared and was subjected to the grafting-onto reaction using a living polystyrene, to form a densely grafted large ring polymer product as a nanoobject, which was directly observable by the AFM.35,36 On the other hand, the AFM showed a large fraction of uncyclized, linear polymer components remained in the crude cyclization products, revealing the inherent difficulty of the end-to-end cyclization of polymer precursors of high molecular weights. It is remarkable, moreover, that a small portion of nanoobjects corresponding to complex ring polymers having tadpole, 8-shaped, catenated and knotted forms were also identified. This showed, for the first time, that not only single-cyclic but also various complex cyclic polymer topologies are indeed produced through the polymer cyclization process, as previously shown in DNA systems.37', 'An electrostatic self-assembly and covalent fixation (ESA-CF) process has been introduced for the effective synthesis of not only cyclic but also functionalized cyclic and multicyclic polymers, where linear or star telechelic polymers having cyclic ammonium salt groups accompanying small or polymeric plurifunctional carboxylate counteranions are employed as key precursors (Scheme 1E).38–40 Various telechelic polymers have been conve-niently prepared through the relevant living polymerization fol-lowed by the end-capping/end-conversion technique. The choice of such particular types of cyclic ammonium salt end groups as five- and six-membered cyclic ammonium, i.e., N-phenyl-pyrrolidinium and N-phenylpiperidinium salt groups, respec-tively, is of a crucial importance in the ESA-CF process (Scheme 3).41 The former undergoes upon heating a selective ring-opening reaction by a carboxylate counteranion to form an amino ester group through the nucleophilic attack exclusively at the N-adjacent ring (endo) position. On the other hand, the latter having unstrained six-membered cyclic ammonium salt groups gives a chemically more stable, simple ester group through the nucleophilic attack at the alternative N-adjacent (exo) position, to eliminate N-phenylpiperidine.', 'And in the electrostatic polymer self-assembly, the cations at the end of the telechelics and the anions in the carboxylates counteranions always balance the charges. Upon the dilution, the self-assembly tends to dissociate into one having the smallest number of polymer components by keeping the balance of the charges (Scheme 4). Thus, when a self-assembly comprised of a linear telechelic precursor, typically poly(THF), having cyclic ammonium salt groups accompanying either a dicarboxylate or a tetracarboxylate counteranion was heated at dilution, the selective ring-opening reaction of the cyclic ammonium groups took place to produce single-cyclic (ring) or dicyclic (8-shaped) polymerproducts,respectively,inhighyields.38,42Ring poly(THF)s having the molecular weights of up to 10 000, cor-responding to the ring size of as high as 700 atoms, were obtainable and characterized unequivocally by the MALDI-TOF mass technique. Furthermore, the ESA-CF process with dynamic equilibrium nature has been exploited to construct various multicyclic as well as cyclic-linear hybrid polymer topologies (Scheme 5).6', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Moreover, ring polymers possessing the prescribed functional groups at the designated positions, i.e., kyklo-telechelics and cyclic macromonomer, have also been prepared by employing telechelic precursors possessing such functional groups as hydroxyl, olefinic, acetylenic, and azide groups at the designated, typically a center, position by using the relevant initiator, or by introducing functional linking reagents.43 They were subse-quently applied to construct more complex polymer topologies either through the covalent linkage or even through the non-covalent, mechanical linkage uniquely formed by threading with ring polymer units.44,45 It was also shown that network polymers formed from cyclic polymer precursors exhibited unique gel properties compared with conventional gels obtained with linear/ branched polymer precursors.46 Moreover, the topological conversion of polymers between ring/linear and even between single-cyclic/dicyclic topologies has now been achieved.45,47,48', 'By the combination of the ESA-CF protocol with selective covalent linking chemistry, a wide variety of multi-cyclic as well as cyclic-linear conjugated polymers have been synthesized.49 In particular, the combination of the ESA-CF process with the metathesis condensation and with the click process has now been revealed as a versatile means to construct a variety of complex multicyclic polymer topologies of fused-, spiro- and bridged forms (Scheme 6).50 Both the functional ring polymer precursors and thecovalentlylinkedmulticyclicpolymerproductwere unequivocally characterized by means of a series of spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques including MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy and SEC. As shown in Fig. 1, for a typical example, the structure of the polymer products having complex multicyclic topologies is convincingly demonstrated. The ESA-CF process has further been applied for the effective synthesis of topologi-cally unique polymer catenanes comprised of large polymer rings51 through the two orthogonal non-covalent interactions, namely the electrostatic and the hydrogen-bond interactions (Scheme 5).45', '@', '@', '3.Topology effects by cyclic polymers: depleting the chain-ends and beyond', 'In contrast to linear or branched polymer topologies, ring polymer topologies are uniquely defined by their absence of the chain ends.3,5 As recognized by the typical case of glass transition temperature (Tg), the topology effect of ring polymers is thus arisen from the depletion of the end-groups of polymer segments. Thus, the Tg of ring polymers is higher than the linear counter-part, until the polymer chain length becomes long enough to diminish the contribution of the chain end. On the contrary, the hydrodynamic volume or the melt viscosity of ring polymers is inherently smaller than their linear counterparts irrespective of their chain lengths. This indicates the distinctive conception in the topology effect by ring polymers. The latter is regarded as an inherent topology effect by ring polymers, while the former as the depletion effect of the polymer chain ends. Nevertheless, the elimination of the chain ends of polymer molecules inevitably leads to the formation of cyclic constructions to bring the topology effect, now drawing increasing interests to discover unusual properties and functions in polymer materials covering mechanical, thermal, electric, photonic and bio-related applica-tions either in bulk or at surface. From an experimental point of view, moreover, further developments are awaited to provide ring polymers possessing high molecular weights with guaran-teed purity, since the mixing of even small amount of linear counterpartmightcauseinconclusiveorevenerroneous conclusions on the topology effect by ring polymers.', '4.Topology effects on basic polymer properties: simulations and experiments from simple to complex cyclic polymers', 'Basic characteristics of single-cyclic (ring) homopolymers either in solution or bulk, in static or dynamic states, have extensively been studied and documented relevantly.3 Therefore, recent studies have elaborated either on specific polymers of practical importance like polyethylenes,52 on specific chain characteristics like semiflexible to stiff nature,53 or on multicomponent polymer systemstypicallyblockcopolymers.54Notably,moreover, theory and simulation studies have increasingly focused on multi-cyclic complex polymers, obviously promoted by synthetic developments on complex topological polymers.55–57 Unique topological polymer properties envisaged by the simulation studies are now to be verified experimentally using relevant topological polymers. Indeed, a collaborative simulation and experimental study on the liquid chromatography study has been conducted on multi-cyclic polymers, and could provide a basis for the purification and the characterization of polymers having complex topologies.58', '@', '@', 'The diffusion behavior is of particular interest in view of the topology effects on polymer molecules, since the self-diffusion of linear and branched polymers follows the reptation mechanism, a snake-like translational motion, in which the polymer chain ends tend to command the motion of their in-chain segments.59Cyclic polymers are unique, on the other hand, in the absence of chain ends, and their non-reptation dynamics has been a subject of both theory/simulation and experimental studies.60', 'A single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy is a unique means to observe directlythe motion of single polymer molecules.61 Thus, the ESA-CF process was applied with mono- and bifunctional telechelic poly(THF) precursors having N-phenylpiperidinium (six-membered ring) groups possessing a perylene dicarboxylate counteranion, to produce ring and linear poly(THF)s having a perylene unit applicable to the single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy measurement (Scheme 7).62', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The subsequent single-molecule imaging was conducted to observe the real-time motion of individual polymer molecules. The video-recording of the motion of single-molecule fluores-cence images, followed by the computational analysis could provide the position and trajectory of the object on the x–y plane as shown in Fig. 2. The histograms of the distribution of the individual diffusion constant were subsequently obtained from large enough datasets of these consecutive images. Upon the statistical analysis of the distribution patterns, a bimodal diffu-sion mechanism was disclosed for ring polymers, corresponding to either threaded or non-threaded conditions in a linear mole-cule matrix. In contrast, the unimodal diffusion was indicated for the linear counterpart (Fig. 3).', 'As shown above, the significant topology effects could be envisaged in polymer properties involving their diffusion process. In this respect, the crystallization dynamics is of a considerable interest since the diffusion and the conformational trans-formation of polymer molecules could dictate the folding and packing of polymer segments in the crystal lattice. To elucidate the topology effect in the crystallization process, a defect-free ring poly(THF) was prepared together with the linear counterpart having the precisely relevant chemical structure.63 Thus, a living bifunctional poly(THF) was terminated with sodium allyloxide to give a telechelic precursor having allyl end groups. The subsequent metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC) with a Grubbs catalyst under dilution, followed by the hydrogenation of the unsaturated linking group afforded a defect-free ring poly(THF), consisting exclusively of oxytetramethylene units (Scheme 8). The isothermal crystallization experiments showed the slower crystallization rate for ring poly(THF)s ascribed to their topologically constrained conformation (Fig. 4). Moreover,', '@', '@', '@', '@ distinctive crystal morphologies are produced, in particular a banded structure in the spherulites exclusively for the ring poly (THF) but not for the linear counterpart. The crystallization kinetics of ring poly(3-caprolactone)s has recently been reported by several groups.64 The faster crystallization rate was observed for ring polymers than the linear counterpart in contrast to the case of poly(THF), and was ascribed to the higher diffusion of ring polymers than their linear counterparts.64', '@', '@', '@', '@', '5.Topology effects by ring polymers in self-assemblies', 'The topology effects by ring polymers could be amplified in their assembled states rather than in their individually separated forms. Therefore, micelles formed by ring polymers should be of a remarkable interest. Thus, a series of micelles were prepared with amphiphilic cyclic AB block copolymers, comprised of eitherpoly(butyleneoxide)/poly(ethyleneoxide)orpoly (propylene oxide)/poly(ethylene oxide), together with their linear AB, linear ABA block copolymer counterparts.65–67 The cyclic block copolymer employed in this study was prepared by a bimolecular process using the hydroxy-terminated linear block copolymer and dichloromethane as a linking reagent in the presence of KOH, to form an acetal linking unit (Scheme 9A).', 'The critical micelle concentration (cmc) of the micelle with the cyclic AB block copolymer was similar to or marginally smaller than those with the linear ABA counterparts. On the contrary, the corresponding micelle with the linear AB counterpart showed a significantly smaller cmc. Moreover, the association number (Nw), thermodynamic radius (rt), and hydrodynamic radius (rh) of the micelle with the cyclic AB block copolymers and with the linear ABA counterparts were comparable to each other, but distinctively smaller than those with the linear AB counterparts. These results are consistent with the geometric estimation of the size of the micelles, corresponding to the Nw, rt, and rh, which is dependent on the continuous chain length of the hydrophobic segment in the block copolymers. And, those in the cyclic AB and the linear ABA block copolymers are estimated as a half of that in the linear AB counterpart employed in this study. Moreover, the cyclic AB block copolymer tends to constitute a stiff hairpin-like conformation, resulting in a slightly larger hydrophobic core within the micelle compared to that with the linear ABA coun-terpart having free chain ends. The enthalpy of micellization (DmicH�) was also smaller with the cyclic AB block copolymer than that with the corresponding linear ABA counterpart, presumably because the segmental flip-flop is inhibited in the micelle with the former, in contrast to the motional freedom by the latter having free chain ends. This also agrees with the smaller entropy of micellization (DmicS�) with the cyclic AB block copolymer than with the linear counterpart.', '@', '@', 'More recently, a significant topology effect has been revealed in the thermal stability of the micelle formed with cyclic AB block copolymers in comparison with the linear ABA and even with the linear AB counterparts.68 Notably, a variety of relevant cyclic lipids, thus a type of surfactants, have been discovered in the cell membrane of thermophilic archaea, single-cell microorganisms, surviving in the hostile environment of very high-temperatures located at hot springs and submarine volcanoes.69 Thus, an amphiphilic cyclic AB block copolymer, comprised of poly(butyl acrylate)/poly(ethylene oxide) segments, was prepared. The unimolecular, metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC) process was employed using a linear ABA block copolymer precursor having olefinic end groups (Scheme 9B).21', 'The obtained cyclic and the relevant linear block copolymers were allowed to form the corresponding micelles, in which their cmc’s and the number-average hydrodynamic volumes (Dh) were measured to be closely comparable to each other (Fig. 5).68 The size and morphology of the micelles with either block copolymers were directly observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 6) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 6) to show commonly flower-like spherical shapes possessing the consistent diameters determined by DLS (Scheme 10).', 'Remarkably, the thermal stability of the micelles was drasti-cally enhanced using the cyclic block copolymer. Thus, the corresponding micelle solutions were heated from 20�C in a stepwise fashion (Fig. 7), and the micelle with the linear ABA block copolymer became turbid at around 25 �C, while that with the cyclic AB counterpart was stable till above 70 �C.68', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Based on the large deviation of the clouding point (Tc) among the micelles either solely with cyclic or with linear block copol-ymers, the tuning of the Tc of the micelle was achieved by the coassembly of both the linear and cyclic block copolymers.68Thus, the Tc was systematically altered along with the relative contents of the cyclic and the linear block copolymer compo-nents in the micelle, as shown in Fig. 7.68 This topology effect will be utilized to design temperature-responsive devices encapsu-lating and releasing appropriate components in and from the micelle. In particular, the topology-based polymer materials design should be suitable for human body-related applications including drug delivery system, food, and cosmetics, for which the modification of chemical structure and molecular weight mightinducereasonableconcernoverthetoxicityand biocompatibility.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '6.Topology effects by functional ring polymers having programmed chemical structures', 'Along with the introduction of new synthetic methodologies, an increasing variety of functional ring polymers and oligomers have become obtainable to exploit their topology effects. A number of recent studies are presented in this section, covering a diverse field either by conjugated cyclic oligomers,70 by photo-responsive ring polymers,71,72 by biodegradable ring polyesters,14by temperature-responsive ring polymers,12,13or by pharmaco-logically functional ring polymers.73', 'Conjugated polymers and oligomers have currently been extensively studied primarily due to their potential for diverse electronic and photonic applications.74 Ring-shaped conjugated polymers and oligomers have attracted particular interests as a prototype of the molecularly fabricated electric circuit, since the circulation of electrons/holes might be induced along the ‘‘endless’’ conjugated segments. A wide variety of conjugated ring oligomers possessing the increasing numbers of unsaturated groups have thus been prepared to test their electrochemical properties.70 Fully conjugated large ring polymers, on the other hand, have still been an elusive synthetic challenge. It is notable, moreover, that a twisted, Moebius stripe-like conjugated olig-omer has attracted considerable interests because of their unusual non-H€uckel aromaticity, in contrast to the conventional H€uckel-type aromaticity which is dependent on its planar geometry by conjugated units.75', 'Photo-response behaviors could be influenced by polymer topologies of either ring or linear forms. Thus, a ring polymer having photo-responsive azobenzene units in the main chain was prepared through the bimolecular end-to-end cyclization via click chemistry.71 Upon the irradiation of UV light, both the trans-to-cis and the cis-to-trans isomerization proceeded slightly faster by the ring polymer in comparison with the linear counterpart. This behavior was attributed to the higher topo-logical constraint of the former than the latter counterpart.71 As another example, a ring polystyrene having two photoactive groups, namely fluorene and anthracene units, was prepared through the bimolecular process using a living bifunctional polystyrene produced with an initiator having a fluorene unit and a linking reagent having an anthracene unit.72 The fluo-rescent behavior of the obtained ring polymer was subsequently studied to show the intramolecular energy migration between the two chromophores.72', 'Naturally occurring ring polymers, such as cyclic DNAs, cyclic peptides as well as cyclic polysaccharides,3 and multi-cyclic counterparts like cyclotides,76 are known to exhibit higher stability against biologically induced decomposition. In this relevance, the topology effect of aliphatic biodegradable poly-esters on their decomposition behavior has been investigated.14Thus, ring poly(caprolactone) was prepared through the unim-olecular click polymer cyclization using the corresponding precursor having an azide and an alkyne group. The higher hydrolytic stability was then observed in comparison with the linear counterparts.14 Notably, moreover, such biodegradable ring polyesters by poly(valerolactone) and by poly(lactide) were also prepared.15,30,31,77', 'Temperature-responsivepropertiesofpoly(N-iso-propylacrylamide), poly(NIPAM), have extensively been studied for their eventual uses in the controlled release devices and for the cell–sheet applications.78 The two groups recently reported the topology effects by ring poly(NIPAM)s.12,13 Thus, the two groups prepared linear poly(NIPAM) precursors having alkyne and azide end groups either by a reversible addition–fragmen-tation chain transfer (RAFT) or by an atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) technique, and the unimolecular click process was commonly applied for the subsequent polymer cyclization. The cloud point (TCP) of the obtained ring poly(NIPAM) by one group was several degrees higher than that of the corresponding linear counterpart. In addition, they observed that the phase transition by the ring polymers took place distinctively slower upon heating.12 Another group, on the other hand, observed the ring poly(NIPAM) showing a few degrees lower TCP against the linear counterpart at the higher solution concentration, while higher at the lower solution concentration. Furthermore, they reported the smaller enthalpy change (DH) during the phase transition with the ring poly (NIPAM). These results were accounted for by the suppression of the hydrogen bond interaction between the ring poly(NIPAM) with water molecules due to their topological constraints in comparison with the flexible linear counterpart having free chain ends.13', 'A pharmacological application of ring polymers has recently been demonstrated by elucidating the filtration/elimination mechanism of a kidney through its nanoporous channel.73 Thus, it was anticipated that the ring polymer could remain longer in a body than the linear counterpart, since the former should be reluctant to transform its conformation into a folded shape to traverse through the nanoporous channels of the kidney.73 To test this topology effect, a series of linear and cyclic poly(capro-lactone)s having poly(ethylene glycol) graft segments and having phenolic functionalities for radiolabeling by 125I were prepared. The lower secretion into urine and in turn the higher accumu-lation in various organs was indeed confirmed with the ring polymer having an appropriate molecular weight, corresponding to its hydrodynamic volume.73 These findings may provide new design methodologies for drug carriers and imaging agents via the topology-based control of a blood circulation time.', '7.Conclusions and future perspectives', 'In this review, we have shown a variety of recent achievements in topological polymer chemistry, to focus on novel polymer properties and functions uniquely revealed by ring polymers. The topology effects, in particular by ring polymers have now offered unique opportunities in polymer materials design unattainable by other means. A viable promise for the practical utilization of the topology effect undoubtedly includes the modification of any existing polymeric materials dependent mostly on linear poly-mers, inflicting little concern on chemical toxicity and environ-mentalpollution.Furthermore,broaderopportunitiesof topology effects by not only single-cyclic but also multi-cyclic polymers are expected in polymer chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, and materials science.', 'Acknowledgements', 'We thank Sekisui Chemical Grant Program for Research on Manufacturing Based on Learning from Nature (Y.T.), The Mitsubishi Foundation (Y.T.), Tokuyama Science Foundation (T.Y.), CASIO Science Promotion Foundation (T.Y.), The Japan Securities Scholarship Foundation (T.Y.), The Kurata Memorial Hitachi Science and Technology Foundation (T.Y.), and Yazaki Memorial Foundation for Science and Technology for financial support.

2025-04-02 17:16:14 - WARNING: ['Synthesis of periodic polyolefins based on anionic alternating copolymerization†', 'Hong Yan, Hongyuan Bai, Xuefei Wang, Haitao Leng, Siwei Chen, Li Hanand Hongwei Ma*', 'To avoid sequence bias in the chain growth process of multicomponent periodic polymers, we reportedan indirect method for the synthesis of strictly periodic polymers using nonpolar monomers. Using 1,1-diphenylethylene (DPE) as the comonomer, the precise sequence was achieved through living anionic polymerization (LAP) and hydrogenation. Four dienes (isoprene (Ip), 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene (DMBD),2,3-diphenylbutadiene-1,3-diene (DPB), and 1-phenyl-1,3-butadiene (1-PB)) and an olefin with cyclictension 1-cyclobutylvinylbenzene (CBVB) were copolymerized with DPE to prepare the alternating pre-cursors. The periodic sequences of DPE–styrene–propylene (pd-DSP), DPE–propylene–propylene (pd-DPP), DPE–ethylene–styrene (pd-DES), DPE–styrene–styrene (pd-DSS) and DPE–ethylene–styrene–styrene (pd-DESS) were successfully synthesized with hydrogenation of these alternating precursors, and the nonpolar olefin units were successfully introduced into the periodic polymer. The results showed thatthe modification of the backbone carbon framework structure caused a consistent change in the thermalproperties of the polymers. Moreover, the steric hindrance and arrangement density of the side chain substituents could significantly affect the performance of the periodic copolymers. This study provides afeasible method for the synthesis of non-polar periodic copolymers with precise periodic arrangements.', 'Introduction', 'The sequence structure of polymers forms the basis for the expression of their properties.1–3 Among various sequences, periodicpolymersare composed ofmultiplemonomers arranged in a regular pattern, as well as the side chain groups.4–6 Therefore, compared with other sequences such as random, block, or gradient distributions, the ordered structure of periodic polymers can better guide the folding and assem-bly of the polymer chains. They exhibit wide applicability in emerging fields such as drug delivery, battery storage and optical components.7–10 Various types of periodic polymers often have defective structures, because it is difficult for mul-tiple types of monomers to undergo strict crossover reactions according to the preset requirements.11 Therefore, only in the polymerization of two monomers, alternating sequences can beobtainedbysuppressingthehomo-propagation reactions.12–14Constructingalternatingsequencesisan effective method to obtain precise periodic sequences.', 'Step-growth polymerization employs efficient orthogonal reactions between the functional groups to achieve precise and strict sequences, which can prevent the formation of defective structures; click reactions and multicomponent reactions are widely used in the construction of alternating structures. For example, the Ugi, CuAAC and Passerini reactions have been used to synthesize complex periodic sequences such as [ABCB], [ABCBA] and [ABCDCB].15–18 However, step-growth polymerization can only yield precise sequences of oligomers. Furthermore, in the preparation of high molecular weight peri-odic copolymers, combining step-growth polymerization and chain-growth polymerization is more promising and challen-ging. For example, current research has achieved the synthesis of periodic copolymers possessing [ABC], [ABBA], and [ABBCD] repeating structures by the combination of reversible-de-activationradicalpolymerizations(RDRPs)andcoupling reactions.19–22 In addition, radical coupling reactions (RACPs) have also been reported to prepare periodic copolymers with [ABC], [ABAC], and [ABCC] repeating structures.23,24 The above methods are capable of obtaining relatively precise periodic structures that require a combination of multiple mechanisms and rely on the special functional groups of monomers. For non-polar polymers, none of the above methods are appli-cable. Living ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) is an extremely efficient synthesis strategy to produce periodic non-polar polymers. Based on the information from periodic sequences, it is necessary to design and construct the required macrocyclicolefinsandthenobtainperiodicsequences through ring opening metathesis polymerization of mono-mers, such as the periodic sequences of styrene, ethylene, or propylene.25–27 Based on this theoretical foundation, our research group developed a new method for carbon skeleton regulation in previous studies. The styrene derivatives with cyclic substituents underwent anion-migrated ring-opening polymerization, followed by hydrogenation, and we success-fully synthesized polymers with pd-SEM and pd-SEE periodic sequence structures.28 This method was able to achieve the goal of obtaining strictly precise periodic sequences through chain polymerization.', 'Inspired by this work, apart from homopolymers, only alter-nating polymers can also achieve strict sequence control by chainpolymerization.Assumingthatmultiplenonpolar olefins are directly copolymerized through chain growth to obtain periodic structures, the insertion of monomer units is determined by the reactivity ratio, which is controlled by temp-erature and solvent;29–32 thus, perfect periodic insertion is impossible. Furthermore, owing to the influence of dynamics, the precision of the sequence sharply decreases during the polymerization process until the sequence structure becomes statistically random. However, in various types of copolymer sequence control, only alternating sequences can be strictly achieved; perfect alternation will occur when both r1 and r2 are equal to zero, or when r1r2 = 0, alternating sequences can also be obtained. Therefore, the problem of statistical randomness can be avoided by synthesizing a strict alternating structure andfunctionalizingthisstructuretoobtainaperiodic structure.33', 'This process provides an indirect method to obtain strictly periodic structures through chain growth aggregation. Among the various methods for synthesizing alternating copolymers, living anionic polymerization can precisely control the mole-cular weight of polymers, with no termination or chain trans-fer during the active chain growth process.34–36 It is difficult to homopolymerize DPE and its derivatives because of steric hin-drance. However, owing to the P–π conjugated structure formed between the two benzene rings and the vinyl group in the monomer, DPE can easily copolymerize with other nonpo-lar olefins. During the process of LAP, the formation of DPE terminal active centers can only lead to alternating cross-growth with comonomers.37,38 Therefore, DPE and various nonpolar olefins can be utilized to synthesize polymers with strictly alternating structures. In this study, four different dienes and a special olefin capable of undergoing a ring-opening reaction were selected for copolymerization with DPE, andfivenewalternatingcopolymersweresuccessfully obtained by adjusting the reaction conditions. All copolymers had carbon–carbon double bonds incorporated into their polymer backbones. After simple hydrogenation treatment, five multiblock structured polymers, namely, pd-DSP, pd-DPP, pd-DES, pd-DSS and pd-DESS, were obtained. By comparing the performance of alternating sequence copolymers and peri-odic sequence copolymers with the 10 different sequence structures mentioned above, the intricate relationship between the polymer structure and performance could be further eluci- dated. Furthermore, the results from this study indicated that LAP could not only yield fully alternating sequence polymers but also indirectly produce polymers with strictly periodic structures. This method provides a new approach for synthe-sizingmultiperiodicstructuredpolymerswithprecise sequences. Consequently, developing strategies for synthesiz-ing precisely periodic polymers is highly challenging and valu-able; this exploration has the potential to enrich the types of periodic sequences and obtain polyolefin materials with better mechanical properties.', 'Results and discussion', 'Polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) are the most widely used general-purpose plastics in the world, and ethylene-co-propylene also has many potential applications. By utilizing a Ziegler–Natta catalyst to catalyze the trans-1,4-polymerization of Ip and hydrogenation, a precise sequence of ethylene-alt-propylene (alt-EP) can be synthesized.39 This type of alternat-ing polymer was obtained through the complex coordination polymerization of a single monomer and severely compro-mised the ability to regulate the carbon skeleton of the poly-mers. Based on the above alt-EP, we introduced other ethylene monomers to copolymerize with Ip to form a fully alternating sequencecopolymer;then,acarbon-richmultiperiodic polymer can be obtained in the same manner after hydrogen-ation. DPE has inherent advantages in the synthesis of alter-nating copolymers by LAP (rD = 0); thus, periodic polymers of DPE–ethylene–propylene (pd-DEP) can be obtained by control-ling the alternation sequence of DPE and Ip. For nonpolar polyolefins, the performance of the copolymer relies more on the arrangement of short branches (methyl) or side groups (phenyl rings) along the main polymer chain when the carbon skeleton structures are similar. Therefore, three types of peri-odic sequences (DPE–propylene–propylene (DPP), DPE–ethyl-ene–ethylene–St (DEES) and DPE–St–St (DSS)) can be obtained by introducing substituted dienes (DMBD, 1-PB, and DPB). The above four types of periodic polymers have a C6 carbon skeleton. Apart from the arrangement of monomer units, the carbon skeleton length affects the properties of polymers. ROMP is an effective method for preparing long carbon skel-etons. Based on this theory, our research group has proposed the AMROP method, which produces a periodic polymer with a C8 backbone structure like DPE–St–ethylene–ethylene (DSEE) (Scheme 1).40', 'The strategy of this study is to obtain strict periodic sequences by using strict alternating polymers; thus, the first step is to regulate DPE and various dienes to form strict alter-nating copolymers. For nonpolar monomers, r1r2 = 0 is a rigid requirement for the synthesis of alternating copolymers; in LAP, the main way of controlling sequences is to alter the reac-tivity ratios of the monomers. The four main pathways are as follows: (1) by adjusting the feeding strategy, the copolymer sequence structure can be changed. Yuki et al. investigated the reaction characteristics of DPE and St in nonpolar solvents during anionic polymerization, and reactivity ratios could be calculated based on the monomer feed ratio and the pro-portion of monomer units in the polymer. (2) The addition of a modifier can effectively promote dynamic propagation and regulate the copolymerization behavior of the monomers. For example, alkoxide metal modifiers can form a special four-mem-bered ring transition state structure with an active center, and the two coexisting counterions can isomerize with each other, thereby altering the rate of crossover propagation. (3) The sol-vation ability and polarity of the solvent directly influence the morphology of the active center, can alter the closeness of the ion pairs and thus affect the reactivity ratios of the monomers. For example, when DPE and Ip are copolymerized in benzene, r2 can reach a maximum of 37, but when they are copolymerized in THF, r2 decreases to 0.11. (4) Temperature affects mainly the reac-tivity ratios of the monomers by affecting the rate constant of crossover propagation. Generally, anionic polymerization occurs at temperatures ranging from −20 °C to 100 °C.41–46 Based on the various regulation methods mentioned above, DPE can be copolymerized with Ip, DMBD, 1-PB, and DPB to obtain strictly alternating polymers. The specific copolymerization process is described in ESI Table S1.†', '@', '@', 'The methyl groups of DMBD serve as electron-donating substituents, not only increasing its steric hindrance but also reducing its reactivity in nucleophilic reactions. As described in Yuki’s report, even if DMBD (M2) and DPE (M1) were copoly-merized in benzene, r2 was only 0.23. For low-reactivity olefins, the polymer structure could be controlled to form alternating sequences by employing a feed strategy. Through the corres-ponding analysis of proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) data (see ESI Fig. S7† and Table 1), the M1/M2 value of DPE and DMBD increased from 1 to 4; this resulted in an increase in the con-version rate of DPE from 69.98% to 88.68% (Covn.M1(%) = Covn.M2(%)/(N2/N1)) and the NDMBD/ND value could reach 1.09 (as calculated via ESI eqn (S7)†). Based on the above results, its structure can be preliminarily identified as an alternating sequence. The obtained polymer had a narrow distribution and a molecular weight close to the predicted value. The con-version rate of DMBD reached 96.66%, indicating that no side reactions occurred during the copolymerization (see Table 1). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) is a direct method for deter-mining the alternating sequence. As shown in Fig. 1(b), using DPE-alt-DMBD as an example, the MALDI-TOF-MS result showed a unique series of proton peaks. The m/z peak at 2967.39 (see ESI Fig. S17†) could be attributed to 10 units of DPE (10 × 180.09 u) + 11 units of DMBD (11 × 68.12 u) + a hydrogen terminal group (1.01 u) + a counterion Ag (106.91 u) + a sec-butyl-terminal group (57.07 u). The difference in the numerical values between each peak consisted of one DPE unit and one DMBD unit.', 'However, for highly active dienes, simply increasing the feeding of DPE not only fails to obtain alternating sequences, but also causes waste of resources. The reactivity ratios of DPE and Ip(M2) are strongly influenced by the solvent, with r2', '@', '@', 'a Mn (SEC) and PDI values for the copolymers were determined using SEC with polystyrene (PS) as a standard. b Ratio of N2/N1 units in the chaincalculated by 1H NMR (N1 represents the number of DPE in the chains and N2 represents the number of dienes in the chains).

Therefore, DPE and IP should be copolymerized in THF (run 1), and their corresponding 1H NMR spectra and MALDI-TOF-MS result are presented in ESI Fig. S6 and S16† (calculated using ESI eqn (S6)†). The polymerization con-ditions of DPE-alt-1-PB and DPE-alt-DPB can be understood by analyzing and comparing the structures of Ip and DMBD, as well as their polymerization conditions. The reaction activity of conjugated dienes is determined by both the conjugation effect and steric hindrance. The 1-position carbon of 1-PB con-tains a phenyl ring substituent, and the presence of this elec-tron-withdrawing group reduces the electron cloud density on the double bond; this is advantageous for the attack of the carbon anions, and therefore, the reactivity of 1-PB is greater than that of Ip. DPB contains two phenyl ring substituents; these substituents reduce the electron cloud density and increase the steric hindrance. Therefore, its reactivity is greater than that of DMBD but lower than that of Ip. Both DPE-alt-1-PB and DPE-alt-DPB can be obtained in THF (runs 5 and 6). The corresponding analyses of the 1H NMR spectra and the MALDI-TOF-MS result are presented in ESI Fig. S8, S9 and S18, S19,† calculated using ESI eqn (S8) and (S9).†', 'The sequence regulation in the copolymers obtained by LAP is controlled by their kinetic behavior. In the preliminary stage, our research group has investigated the copolymeriza-tion reaction characteristics of DPE and CPVB. At room temp-erature, the self-growth kinetic constants of both DPE and CPVB are zero (KCP = 0 and KDD = 0 at 25 °C). Therefore, a new polymerization mechanism, AMROP, is proposed to explain the ideal alternating copolymerization process of CPVB and DPE derivatives. The proposed AMROP provides more possibi-lities for controlling the carbon framework of vinyl monomer polymers; thus, we have shifted our focus to CBVB, which is a styrene derivative with different ring substituents from CPVB. Previously, studies have reported that CBVB can homopolymer-ize through AMROP; its cyclobutyl can be opened and formed into a C5 skeleton polymer by increasing the temperature; the pd-SEE periodic polymer can be obtained after hydrogenation. In the same way, the self-growth kinetic constants of both DPE and CBVB are zero (KCB = 0 and KDD = 0 at 25 °C). Therefore, DPE and CBVB can likely undergo cross-growth at room temp-erature by AMROP and yield a quaternary periodic polymer structure of pd-DSEE. Theoretically, CBVB-alt-DPE can be obtained with a 1 : 1 feed ratio at room temperature. The intra-molecular bond angle of the cyclopropyl three-membered ring in CPVB is 60°, and the hydrogen atoms on the ring are in overlapping positions; these hydrogen atoms can easily create tensionandthereforefacilitatering-openingreactions. However, the intramolecular angle of the cyclobutyl group in CBVB is 90°, resulting in lower ring tension than that of the ternary ring. Therefore, the polymerization reaction rate of DPE and CBVB is slightly lower. With the same design, the conversion rate of CBVB increased from 46% to 84% by extend-ing the polymerization time from 5 days (run 7) to 10 days (run 8), and the molecular weight of the copolymers also doubled. Based on 1H NMR spectrum characterization (ESI Fig. S10†), regardless of whether the conversion rate of CBVB was high or low, the ND/NB value was close to 1; these results confirmed that DPE-alt-CBVB was successfully synthesized. Here, we tested the MALDI-TOF-MS data of low-molecular-weight (run 7) and high-molecular-weight (run 8) polymers, and several series of proton peaks appeared in the spectra. As shown in Fig. 1(e), the peak with an m/z of 2374.28 corresponded to 7 units of DPE (7 × 180.09 u) repeat units +6 units of CBVB (6 × 158.11 u) repeat units + a hydrogen terminal group (1.01 u) + a counterion Ag (106.91 u) + a sec-butyl-terminal group (57.07 u) (ESI Fig. S20†). Similarly, based on the analysis of the data in ESI Fig. S21,† the polymerization time was prolonged, and DPE and CBVB still grew alternately.', 'In conjugated dienes, the mobility of the double bond elec-tron cloud is high, and it is easy to induce polarization. When the density of the π electron cloud on the carbon–carbon doublebonddecreases,theslightlypositivelycharged β-carbon atom is conducive to the attack of the negatively charged anionic active center, causing π-electron heterolysis and initiating anionic polymerization. During the addition reaction of the conjugated dienes with nucleophilic reagents, both 3,4-addition and 1,4-addition can occur. In the case of 1,4-addition, unsaturated double bonds are formed in the polymer skeleton, thereby forming a cis/trans structure. When DPE is copolymerized with Ip, DMBD, 1-PB and DPB, the diole-fins need to be copolymerized with DPE by 1,4-addition to obtain long carbon chain structures. In the polymerization of DPE and Ip, DPE is preferentially triggered by sec-BuLi to form DPE-Li; DPE-Li initially attacks the carbon at the 4-position with less steric hindrance, forming an active center at the carbon at the 1-position with the least steric hindrance. Therefore, the next DPE is added to the carbon at the 1-posi-tion during the alternating copolymerization. As a result, mainly 1,4-structures are formed, with few 3,4-structures pro-duced and almost no formation of a 1,2-structure. Therefore, the 1,2-structures and 3,4-structures were disregarded in the subsequent description of the polymer structure. In the carbonpolymerbackbonestructureoftheDPE-alt-1-PB polymer, 3% 1,2-structures can be clearly observed via 1H NMR (ESI Fig. S8,† δ = 5.7–6.2 (ppm)). However, due to its low content, subsequent discussions are focused only on the 1-PB appearing in the polymer with 1,4-structures. Therefore, the polymer backbones can still ensure the rigor of their periodic structure after hydrogenation. Both DMBD and DPB have sub-stituents at the 2-position carbon and 3-position carbon. DMBD contains two methyl groups, which are electron-donat-ing substituents despite their relatively small steric hindrance. On the other hand, DPB has two phenyl rings as substituents, which are electron-withdrawing groups with significant steric hindrance. Together, these factors caused DMBD and DPB to undergo 1,4-addition to the polymer chain. The1H NMR spectra (ESI Fig. S7 and S9†) also revealed that the unsaturated double bond regions of DPE-alt-DMBD and DPE-alt-DPB had no peaks (δ = 4.0–6.0 (ppm)), showing the absence of a 1,2-structure in the polymer chain. The above results indicated that all five alternating polymers were successfully synthesized according to the proposed structure. A comparison of DPE-alt-Ip and DPE-alt-DMBD revealed that the carbon skeletons of the polymer backbones had the exact same arrangement, but the side chain of DPE-alt-DMBD contained an additional methyl group. When the two polymers had similar molecular weights, the Tg of DPE-alt-DMBD was 16 °C higher. Similarly, DPE-alt-DMBD and DPE-alt-DPB only differed in the size of the side group substitution, and Tg increased by 36 °C. A compari-son of the data revealed that the Tg values of DPE-alt-1-PB and DPE-alt-Ip exhibited unexpected trends. Typically, polymers with a benzene ring as the side group had a greater Tg than those with only a single methyl group. However, in this case, the absence of any substituents on the double bonds in the chain of DPE-alt-1-PB enabled increased bond rotation, result-ing in a Tg for DPE-alt-Ip that was 36 °C higher than expected. Therefore, the thermal properties of nonpolar olefin copoly-mers could be controlled by altering the number of substitu-ents, steric hindrance, and position. The polymer backbones of the five alternating structure polymers all contained double bonds. These double bonds could be used for simple hydro-genation modification to obtain the most basic periodic poly-mers and for more complex substitution and addition reac-tions to produce polymers with different side groups, thus endowing the polymer with a periodic arrangement of the functional groups (Scheme 2).', 'For common nonpolar olefins, controlling the copolymer sequence is often difficult (r1r2 > 0). In our previous work, AMROP was used to develop a new method for regulating the carbon skeleton. After hydrogenation, we successfully obtained strictly periodic polymers of pd-SE, pd-SEM and pd-SEE. Based on the research results, we introduced the special vinyl monomer DPE into the polymer backbone. This not only expanded the carbon skeleton length of the periodic structure and enriched the periodic carbon chain structure, but also increased the richness and feasibility of the design of previous alternating copolymers. The alternating copolymers obtained by LAP in the early stage needed to be hydrogenated to obtain novel periodic polymers. The specific hydrogenation process is described in the ESI.† In this way, five new periodic polymers, pd-DEP, pd-DES, pd-DSEE, pd-DPP and pd-DSS, were obtained.', 'DPE-alt-IP, DPE-alt-1-PB and DPE-alt-CBVB showed signifi-cant changes in the unsaturated region of the 1H NMR spectra before and after hydrogenation because of the double bond of their polymer backbones. Hence, the hydrogenation degree of each hydrogenated product could be directly calculated based on the integral of the hydrogen spectrum (ESI eqn (S13-2), (S14) and (S15)†). The structure of the hydrogenated polymer was characterized by DEPT-135°-13C NMR and 13C NMR (ESI Fig. S13–S15†). The unsaturated carbon peaks of DPE-alt-IP at δ = 130.0–132.0 ppm, DPE-alt-1-PB at δ = 132.0–140.0 ppm and DPE-alt-CBVB at δ = 130.0–137.0 ppm all disappeared; these results further confirmed that the degree of hydrogenation was high. The degree of hydrogenation for the above three struc-tures is shown in Fig. 2. Moreover, it can also explain the acquisition of a strictly periodic structure.', '@', '@', 'However, no change was observed in the unsaturated hydro-gen in the 1H NMR spectra of DPE-alt-DMBD and DPE-alt-DPB before and after hydrogenation. Therefore, the degree of hydro-genation of the polymers could only be analyzed using inverse-gated carbon IG-13C NMR (Fig. 3). Since the NDMBD/NDPE ratio was 1.09, the number of unsaturated seasonal carbons on the DPE structural unit in the polymer chain remained unchanged after hydrogenation (δ = 148.1–148.7 ppm). Using these data as a reference, the degree of hydrogenation could be calculated based on the change in the unsaturated seasonal carbon content of the DMBD structural units. After characterization by IG-13C NMR and the integration of the spectrum, less than 27% of the double bonds in the chain were not hydrogenated. The specific calculations can be found in ESI eqn (S11-1).† The inefficient hydrogenation was caused by the presence of two methyl substituents adjacent to the double bond in the DMBD unit, which affected the hydrogenation efficiency. Similarly, in DPE-alt-DPB, NDPE/NDPB = 1.12. Notably, the number of qua-ternary carbons on the phenyl rings of DPB remained unchanged after hydrogenation in alternating polymer chains (see Fig. 3, δ = 124.5–129.5 ppm). IG-13C NMR was also used to calculate the unsaturation of the polymer chain. Integral calcu-lations revealed that the degree of hydrogenation of the alter-nating copolymer was greater than 87% (ESI equation (S12- 1)†). Furthermore, the degree of hydrogenation could also be determined by analyzing the ratio of unsaturated carbons on the benzene ring using the DPE unit and the DPB unit. (ESI equation (S12-2)†).', 'Therefore, based on the above experimental results, the use of anionic polymerization and simple post-functionalization successfullyproducedaperiodicpolymerwithastrict sequence arrangement. These periodic sequences contained structures such as ethylene and propylene, which were difficult to obtain using traditional aggregation methods. Nonpolar monomers such as ethylene, propylene, and styrene could not be obtained through LAP with controlled molecular weights and narrow distributions. However, the copolymerization of nonpolar monomers could also yield unique and exceptional properties in the resulting rubber. In this study, DPE-alt-IP and DPE-alt-DMBD polymers were successfully functionalized, and copolymer sequences of ethylene and propylene were easily introduced into the polymer chains. The addition of 1-PB and CBVB introduced copolymer sequences of ethylene and styrene. As the polymer sequence changed from an alter-nating structure to a periodic structure, Tg significantly decreasedcomparedwiththatofthenon-hydrogenated polymer. Tg is an important factor that indirectly affects the flexibility of polymer chains. Generally, the independent double bonds in the polymer backbone increase the flexibility of polymer chains and reduce the glass transition temperature. However, all five sets of data in this study revealed that satur-ation of the double bond in the polymer backbone led to a lowerglasstransitiontemperatureofthepolymer(ESI Fig. S22†). This result occurred because the rotation of the carbon–carbon single bond improved the mobility of the polymer chain, which led to a decrease in the glass transition temperature of the polymer (see Scheme 3a and Table 2). Compared with pd-DPP, when the degree of polymerization was similar and when the arrangement density of the methyl substituents in the periodic structure increased (pd-DEP), the friction between the chain ends increased and the Tg of the periodic polymer increased by 26 °C (see Scheme 3b-1).', '@', '@', '@', '@ However, compared with pd-DPP, when the methyl substituent in the periodic structure became a benzene ring, the steric re-sistance between the structural units became greater, resulting in more difficult chain segment movement. Therefore, the Tg of the periodic polymer changed from 117 °C to 133 °C (see Scheme 3b-2). By comparison, pd-DSS and pd-DPP not only had simple periodic arrangement structures but also extended the arrangement of the periodic structure. PDPPDP and SDSSDS are “head–tail” structures. PDPPDP is the equivalent of inserting a second monomer into two propylene monomers. This is a new polymer structure and can be used as a template polymer to provide a reference for the synthesis of more precise positioning sequence polymers. SDSSDS is equivalent to adding a monomer to two styrene monomer units; this structure is difficult to produce using general copolymerization. On compar-ing SDSSDS with the work of Knoll and coworkers from the BASF on “super-polystyrene”,47 it was a pleasant surprise to find that the Tg of DPE-alt-DPB (161 °C) in this work is very close to that of St-alt-DPE in the aforementioned reference; it was also found that the Tg (133 °C) of pd-DSS is very similar to that of the St/DPE copolymer containing 35% DPE in “super-polystyrene”. The com-parison of this data also proves that the relationship between the polymer structure and the thermal properties can be designed and predicted. In addition, the length of the polymer carbon skeleton also affects the thermal performance. pd-DES and pd-DSEE have C6 and C8 skeleton structures, respectively, with the same types of structural units in the polymer backbones. An increase in the length of the periodic sequence enhances the flexibility of the chain, leading to a significant decrease in the Tg (see Scheme 3b-3).', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'a Determined by SEC using PS as a standard. b Glass transition temperature. c The degree of hydrogenation was calculated using ESI eqn (S11-1)–(S11-3), (S12-1), (S12-2), (S13-1), (S13-2), (S14) and (S15).†', 'Conclusion', 'The focus of this study was on the synthesis of periodic poly-mers with precise sequences. Through the synthesis of alter-nating copolymers, periodic polymers with five new structures, including pd-DEP, pd-DES, pd-DSEE, pd-DPP and pd-DSS, were obtained through hydrogenation. In the synthesis of alternat-ing copolymers, DPE-alt-IP, DPE-alt-DMBD, DPE-alt-1-PB and DPE-alt-DPB were used to change the kinetic behavior of the copolymerbyadjustingthepolymerizationtemperature, solvent and feeding ratio through LAP. The sequence was sub-sequently regulated. DPE-alt-CBVB is a strictly alternating polymerobtainedbytheAMROPmechanismthrough common anionic copolymerization and transfer ring-opening polymerization. After the polymeric backbone was hydrogen-ated and saturated, nonpolar olefins, such as ethylene, propy-lene and styrene, were successfully inserted into the DPE struc-tural unit according to different arrangement combinations; thus, a periodic polymer with a strict arrangement was obtained. When the polymer backbone was saturated, the Tg of the polymer decreased, indicating that the rotation of the carbon–carbon single bond increased the flexibility of the polymer. The Tg values of the polymers with similar periodic arrangements were different; these results indicated that the size of the polymer substituents and the density of the side group arrangement strongly influenced the polymer pro-perties. Furthermore, when the content of substituents was the same, a change in the carbon skeleton length affected the thermal performance of a polymer. Therefore, controlling the length of the periodic sequence, as well as the position, size, and arrangement density of the substituents, could signifi-cantly affect the performance of polymers.', 'Author contributions', 'The manuscript was written by all the authors and each author has contributed to the experiment.

Schubert*a,b,d,f', 'This article presents a versatile method for the preparation of smart interpenetrating polymer networks(IPNs). Based on two different orthogonal binding motives, IPNs are generated by simply mixing ligandcontaining polymers and corresponding metal salts leading to a polymeric material featuring shape-memory abilities. Due to the utilization of heteroleptic complexes as crosslinks in one of the two net-works, simple tuning of the crosslinking density, as well as the generation of IPNs made out of threedifferent main polymers is possible. The structure–property-relationships of the resulting IPNs are investi-gated in a detailed fashion applying FT-Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), dynamic-mechanical-thermal analyses (DMTA) as well as thermo-mechanical analyses (TMA). In the scope ofthermo-mechanical analysis (TMA) excellent shape-memory properties, with strain fixity rates near 100% and strain recovery rates up to 93%, could be observed.', 'Introduction', 'Over many decades, polymers have become an integral part of our daily life. Based on their unique and tunable properties they are used in nearly every application area.1–3 However, the typically applied polymers, which are produced to fulfil a single task over their lifetime, are no longer sufficient. Moreover, we are searching for materials, which are able to adapt their function(s) and properties as a result of experien-cing an environmental change.4 This triggered adaption is beneficial for certain applications and can open completely new fields. For this reason, the research topic dealing with so-called stimuli-responsive polymers has emerged.5–7 One very promising way to obtain such switchable properties in poly-meric materials is the implementation of reversible covalent8or supramolecular crosslinks.9 A variety of such reversible moi-eties have already been successfully used to synthesize switch-able polymers, featuring abilities such as self-healing10 or shape-memory.11', 'Shape-memory polymers (SMPs) have the unique ability to “remember” a predetermined shape.11 After the fabrication of those polymers in their original, so-called permanent shape, it is possible to convert them, under the respective conditions, into a completely new temporary shape. Thereafter, they keep this new shape until an external trigger leads to the induction of the recovery step, in which the “memorized” permanent shape is restored.11,12 The design of SMPs requires, in minimum, two different building units.11,13 Firstly, a trigger-able part, called switching-unit, is important. For this building unit, in general any interaction with a certain degree of reversi-bility can be utilized. Here for example, thermal transitions (e.g., glass transition14 or transition between crystallization and melting15,16) but of course also reversible covalent17,18 or supramolecular bonds19,20 can be mentioned. The other required part is the stable phase. This unit is important for the structural integrity of SMPs and further provides the driving force for the recovery step. It usually consists of covalent21 or physical crosslinks.22 Furthermore, there are also some recent research approaches, in which this part could be generated via an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) structure.23,24', 'Metallopolymers are a special class in the field of polymers, which combine unique properties.25 On the one hand, they have all the advantages of polymers, such as cheap and easy production, low weight, corrosion-resistance and many more.1But at the same time, the integrated metal-complex, whose binding strength and properties can be easily adjusted by the choice of ligand and/or metal salt(s), provides an ideal oppor-tunity for the design of switchable and intelligent materials.26There are numerous reports in literature that deal with metal-lopolymers for a wide variety of stimuli responsive materials for several application fields, e.g., as sensors,27 for drug-deliv-ery28 or self-healing.29,30', 'In order to fabricate smart materials, which are addressable withmultiplestimuliand/orshowmultipleresponses, different dynamic binding motifs, which are orthogonal, need to be integrated.31 This orthogonality can be obtained by the utilization of completely different binding concepts, like, e.g., hydrogen bonds in combination with metal–ligand inter-actions.32 Even though the benefits of metallopolymers, metal–ligand interactions are more likely to interfere with each other, resulting in a lack of orthogonality, which is why such systems solely based on metal complexes are rather limited in literature. Nevertheless, our group already presented a few examples in which SMPs could be generated entirely based on metallopolymersfeaturingexcellentshape-memory abilities.33–35 In this context, two metal complexes of different stability formed the basis for both required structural units. In one of those studies the two complexes, namely a bis-terpyri-dine and a tris- or bis-trityl-histidine complex, could be uti-lized to achieve an IPN structure in a very simple manner.35Thus, this study will be the starting point for the current inves-tigation in which a better tunability of the polymeric structure of the IPN should be obtained by applying heteroleptic metal complexes for the first time. This introduction leads to the possibility to tune one phase of the IPN individually without influence the other part of the polymer.', 'The first network is generated via the formation of a homo-leptic complexes (bis-terpyridine). On the other hand, the second network is crosslinked via the formation of heteroleptic complexes(formedbetweenzinc-tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnTPP) and pyridine (Py)). In this way it is also possible to selectively influence the crosslinking density in the second network. Furthermore, this novel synthetic approach opens the way to include multiple polymers in a single subnetwork (via heteroleptic complexes) of the resulting IPNs broadening the chemistry of IPNs in general.', 'Results and discussion', 'Supramolecular binding motifs', 'The orthogonality of the two utilized metal complexes is the key parameter for the formation of the desired interpenetrat-ing polymer network structure. Furthermore, the utilized metal complexes should be addressable to obtain smart pro-perties in the resulting materials and feature a different stabi- lity in order to represent both required building units for shape-memory polymers. In one of our former studies we uti-lized a stable bis-terpyridine complex to crosslink one, and a much weaker trityl-histidine based complex, for the formation of the second polymer network.35 These two binding motifs were found to be fully orthogonal in the solid state, in particu-lar for the here used combination of iron and zinc ions.', 'The stable bis-terpyridine complex was also selected in this study to obtain a network acting as stable phase during the shape-memory process.', 'The weaker complex, crosslinking the second network and acting as switching unit in the SMPs, was exchanged this time by a heteroleptic binding motif, enabling a better and easier tunability of the IPN composition. In this context, the ZnTPP-Py interaction represents an excellent candidate due to its labile nature and resistance against competing terpyridine (Tpy) ligands. This orthogonality is well-known in literature and derived from steric constraints.36,37 While the ZnTPP pro-vides only one free axial binding site, the multidentate Tpy is not able to coordinate the zinc core. In a previous study we investigated this behavior in a detailed fashion using isother-mal titration calorimetry (ITC) and were able to show that the intrinsic orthogonality remains if the binding motifs are implemented in a polymeric environment.38,39', 'Ligand containing polymers', 'Initially ligand containing monomers, namely 6-(2,2′:6′2″-terpyri-din-4′-yloxy)-hexyl methacrylate (Tpy-MA) as well as N-(4-(10,15,20-triphenylporphyrin-5-yl)phenyl) methacrylamide (TPP-MA), were synthesized. While Tpy-MA was prepared according to a literature procedure,29 TPP-MA was obtained by the treatment of 4-(10,15,20-triphenylporphyrin-5-yl)aniline with methacrylic anhy-dride. A detailed description can be found in the ESI.†', 'Afterwards,thereversible-addition–fragmentation-chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization technique was applied to obtain the polymers P1 to P3 which bear different ligands in their side chains. The synthesis of all polymers is presented in Scheme 1. 2,2′-Azo-bis(2-methylpropionitrile) (AIBN) was uti-lized as initiator for all polymerizations. As chain transfer agent (CTA) either 2-cyano-2-propyl dodecyl trithiocarbonate (CPDT) (P2) or 2-cyano-2-propyl benzodithioate (CPDB) (P1 and P3) was selected. For the synthesis of P1, Tpy-MA was copolymerizedwithbutylmethacrylate(BMA)asmain monomer. The polymer P2 was prepared by copolymerization of the formerly synthesized TPP-MA with 2-ethylhexyl meth-acrylate (2-EHMA). Metalation of the porphyrin moieties with zinc(II) acetate lead to the polymer P2-Zn. The quantitative metalation of all porphyrin side groups was verified by the comparison of the respective NMR spectra (Fig. S3†).38 Due to the loss of the NH-protons, the respective signal at negative ppm-values completely disappeared in the spectrum of P2-Zn. 2-EHMA was also utilized as main monomer for the synthesis of P3a to P3c, together with 4-vinyl pyridine (4-VPy) as com-mercially available ligand monomer. Furthermore, in contrast to P1 and P2, the ligand monomer content was varied for the three different polymerizations (increasing 4-VPy content from P3a to P3c), to enable a simple tuning of the crosslinking density in the network two later on. Additionally, the polymer P3d was synthesized via the copolymerization of styrene and 4-VPy with the same ligand content obtained in P3c. A detailed description of all polymerizations and the metalation of P2 is presented in the ESI (Table S1†). The molar masses as well as dispersities of the synthesized polymers were determined via size exclusion chromatography (SEC). All polymers revealed a unimodal molar mass distribution with low dispersities, which is characteristic for controlled radical polymerization techniques like RAFT.40 The determined molar masses of the linear polymers are rather comparable, ranging from Mn-', '@', '@ values of 12 500 g mol−1 (P1) to 15 400 g mol−1 (P3b). The only exception was found for P3d which only revealed a Mn of 8100 g mol−1. For this polymerization styrene was utilized as comonomer, which is known to yield in lower monomer con-versions when utilizing RAFT.41 A decrease in molar mass could be observed for P2-Zn when compared to the non-meta-lated polymer P2, which indicates a decrease of the hydrodyn-amic radius. This might result from intramolecular inter-actions between the metalated side-chain moieties leading to a varied hydrodynamic behavior after complexation. The1H NMR spectra were used to calculate the exact composition of the final polymers. In particular for P3a to P3d the ligand content played an important role, since one goal of this study was to investigate the influence of the crosslinking density of the switchable polymer network on the shape-memory abilities of the resulting IPNs. It was found that the resulting polymer compositions nearly match the ratio of main monomer to ligand monomer which was utilized for the synthesis. The results of the SEC investigations as well as the determined compositions are listed in Table 1. Further information is given in the ESI (Fig. S2–S7†).', 'Interpenetrating metallopolymer networks', 'After the synthesis of the linear ligand containing polymers, the preparation of the interpenetrating metallopolymer net-works was the next step. As mentioned before, those IPNs should be based on two different networks. Network one, which should be formed from P1 in the presence of iron sulfate, is thereby crosslinked via stable bis-terpyridine-iron(II)-complexes, and network two is formed through the formation of the heteroleptic complexes between P2-Zn and the pyridine side chains of P3a to P3d. A schematic representation of the synthesis of the different IPNs is presented in Fig. 1. A detailed description is provided in the ESI (Table S2†).', 'For all IPNs, an equimolar ratio of [Tpy-ligand] to [TPP-ligand] to [Py-ligand] was utilized, which was calculated based on the composition, determined in the1H NMR spectra. Firstly, two separate mixtures were prepared. Mixture one con-tained P2-Zn (dissolved in chloroform) and the required amount of iron(II) sulfate (dissolved in a small amount of methanol). For the other mixture, the required amounts of P1 and P3 were dissolved in chloroform. Subsequently, mixture two was given to mixture one leading to the formation of the interpenetrating networks based on the orthogonality of both supramolecular binding motifs. This procedure was performed analogously for all different pyridine containing polymers (P3a to P3d), resulting in four different IPNs (IPN-a to IPN-d). While the IPNs-a–c should feature a different crosslinking density, regarding network two, IPN-c and -d only differ in the main monomer of P3. Furthermore, four different model metallopo-lymer networks were prepared. MP-1 was synthesized as refer-ence sample for the stable phase based on P1 by the addition of FeSO4.', 'Furthermore,threedifferentmetallopolymerswere synthesized as reference sample for the labile networks, cross-linked via ZnTPP-Py interactions. Those networks (MP-2a, MP-2c and MP-2d) were prepared by mixing P2-Zn with P3a (EHMA-based with the lowest pyridine content), P3c (EHMA-based with the highest pyridine content), as well as P3d (styrene-based pyridine polymer). The general pro-cedure and the exact amounts are provided in the ESI (Table S3†). In general, the model metallopolymers enable a detailed interpretation of the investigations of the structurally complexIPNs(Ramanspectraormechanicalanalyses) later on.', 'Raman spectroscopic investigations', 'To validate the formation of the interpenetrating networks based on the orthogonality of both supramolecular binding motifs, Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed on the interpenetrating networks IPN-a to IPN-d, the polymers P1 to P3, as well as the model samples MP-1 to MP-2. Raman spectroscopy offers insights into ligand binding, complexation, and structural changes, consequently representing an effective tool for studying the selective formation of orthogonal metal complexes.33,35', 'Characteristic vibrational bands for the binding of vinyl pyr-idine to the porphyrin complex were first identified by investi-gating the model complexes ZnTPP and ZnTPP-Py (Fig. S36†). Here, characteristic shifts of bands in three regions of interest could be identified, which can be used to confirm the binding of Py to the ZnTPP complex. Namely, the band doublet at 390/ 410 cm−1, which can be assigned to νZn–N vibrations,42,43 is further split with the band at 390 cm−1 being redshifted by ca. 8 cm−1 and the band at 410 cm−1 being blueshifted by ca. 5 cm−1. This is caused by the additional electron density donated by the pyridine ligand into the metal orbitals. A further characteristic shift can be identified for the band at 1083 cm−1, which can be assigned to νC–H vibrations of the pyrrole subunits in the porphyrin ligand.42 Here, a redshift of ca. 5 cm−1 is observable. Further redshifts, also attributed to the porphyrin centered modes, can be observed for the bands at 1365 (in-plane skeletal mode of pyrrole unit; −3 cm−1), 1462 (νC–C, bridge; −8 cm−1) and 1496 cm−1 (νC–C, pyrrole; −2 cm−1).42 All of these shifts are caused by partial population of π* orbitals due to the coordination of the axial pyridine, which is an effect well known from literature and weakens the associatedbonds,thusredshiftingthevibrational frequencies.44,45 To confirm that, these changes are also visible in a polymeric environment, model complexes MP2-a to MP2-c were also measured (Fig. S36,† top lines). A polymeric', '@', '@', 'a Eluent: CHCl3/NEt3/i-PrOH [94 : 4 : 2], PMMA standard (P1, P2, P2-Zn and P3a to P3c) or PS standard (P3d) b 300 MHz, CD2Cl2.', '@', '@ environment is known to cause band broadenings, to influ-ence the positions of some bands slightly and of course intro-duces additional, potentially overlapping bands.33 Due to this, only the band shifts for the νZn–N vibration at 390 cm−1 and the νC–C vibration at 1462 cm−1 are visible here. Nevertheless, these shifts are still characteristic enough to allow a clear identification of the formed ZnTPP-Py complex.', 'With these characteristic bands in mind, in a next step IPN-a to IPN-d were studied in the same manner. Due to the additional presence of Tpy ligands, introduced by P1, the band at 1462 cm−1 could not be used for the identification of the pyridine complex, as a strong Tpy band overlaps here. Notwithstanding this, the νZn–N band, which is nicely separ-ated from overlapping bands can be used to clearly prove the formation of the desired ZnTPP-Py complexes within the IPNs.', 'Fig. 2 depicts the Raman spectra of P2-Zn (as a comparison) and the IPNs in the region of interest. For all IPNs clear redshifts of 2.7 to 4.5 cm−1 can be identified, which, keeping in mind the spectral precision of <0.5 cm−1 of the used Raman device, clearly proves the presence of the pyridine complexes.', '@', '@', 'Furthermore, utilizing the same FT-Raman study, the for-mation of the bis-terpyridine-iron(II)-complexes inside the IPNs could be confirmed. The effect of the formation of this complex on the Tpy vibrations has been extensively described in previous studies. Thereby in general, a shift of the strong band located at 996 cm−1 (δC–C) to higher wavenumbers can by observed and cis–trans transition and shortening of the C–C bonds induces more complex changes of the region between 1540 and 1620 cm−1 (νC–C/N).33–35 While the changes in the higher wavenumber region cannot be easily observed for these IPNs, as there is a large amount of overlap with signals from P2-Zn and P3, the characteristic blueshift of the band at 996 cm−1 could be observed for all IPNs (Fig. S37†) proving the formation of both the stabile and labile complex required for their function. Furthermore, no significant uncoordinated ligand fractions could be detected. Therefore, the complex for-mation can be regarded as virtually quantitative.', 'Regarding the implementation of several dynamic metal-complexes inside the prepared IPNs, a potential interference or metal exchange upon thermal cycling needs to be excluded. Raman spectroscopy represents a powerful method in this context, since it provides insights on the molecular level, i.e. the nature of the reversible binding motifs.', 'To examine the long-term stability of the binding motifs under thermal stress, a long-term Raman spectroscopic experi- ment was performed. For this purpose, IPN-c was treated at a reasonableoperatingtemperaturefortheshape-memory process of 80 °C for in total 19 days. The sample was allowed to cool to room temperature every day and a Raman spectrum was recorded (Fig. S55†). In this context, any changes in complex formation during thermal cycling should be visible in significant band shifts over time. The band location of the νZn–N vibration at approx. 390 cm−1, which is characteristic for the ZnTPP-Py complex, was determined for every measure-ment (Fig. S56†). It can be seen from Table S9† that the band location continuously variates between 386.0 and 387.9 cm−1and does not follow an observable trend over time. Thus, it can be concluded that the ZnTPP-Py binding motif is present after every thermal cycle as intended and no thermal induced cross-interactions with the present tpy complex, such as poten-tial transmetalation, occurs.', 'Thermal properties', 'A very important parameter for thermally triggered polymers is their thermal behavior. For this reason, firstly the degradation temperature (Td) of all building block polymers and IPNs was determined applying thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). The investigation of the thermal stability is important to ensure that no degradation of the samples occurs during the manu-facturing steps or the thermally triggered switching. The TGA measurements revealed for all polymers and IPNs a Td above 200 °C. Additionally, within temperature dependent dynamic-mechanical analysis (DMTA), the mechanical properties of the four IPNs as well as those of the reference metallopolymers (MP-2a, MP-2c and MP-2d) were investigated.', 'A plot of those measurements, showing the corresponding loss factors (tan(δ)) depending on the temperature, is pre-sented in Fig. 3. Interestingly, the resulting curve of tan(δ) revealed two maxima for the model polymers MP-2a and MP-2c. One is located at moderate temperatures of 50 to 70 °C and one at higher temperatures around 100 °C.', '@', '@', 'Our assumption is that the lower one results from the glass transition temperature of the polymer chains, while the second one indicates the activation (induced mobility due to partialdecomplexationand/orligandexchange)ofthe ZnTPP-Py complex. By comparing MP-2a with MP-2c, which only differ regarding their crosslinking density, different inten-sities for the two signals are visible. For MP-2c, the model polymer with the highest crosslinking density, the signal at higher temperature is dominant, while the other one is nearly invisible and looks more like a shoulder. In the case of MP-2a, there is a clear peak at around 50 °C and a similarly large elevation later in the curve at around 100 °C. In our opinion, the different trend of the curves can be explained very well by the composition of MP-2a.', 'By combining the results of SEC and the calculated monomer ratio in P3a, it becomes clear that on average the polymer chains carry only 1 to 2 pyridine moieties per chain. However, these polymer chains are unable to form a network structure with P2-Zn, but only cause a supramolecular chain extension at the ZnTPP moieties of P2-Zn, leading to a graft polymer-likearchitecture.Thisdifferentstructurecould explain the strong visibility of the glass transition related signal at moderate temperatures in the case of MP-2a and its “missing” for the sample MP-2c, featuring a relatively high supramolecularcrosslinkingdensity.Furthermore,the maxima are shifted towards higher temperature with increas-ing crosslinking density, which is expected for the glass tran-sition of higher crosslinked networks.', 'The fact that also the second maximum is shifted in the same direction indicates that not only the nature of the revers-ible bond but also the overall content influences the tan(δ) maximum. This behavior can be explained by the thermal acti-vation mechanism of the supramolecular crosslinks in the net-works. With a temperature dependent shift of the equilibrium between stable and activated complexes, a progressive decrease in crosslinking density is expected upon heating. The system will show a maximum in tan(δ) when the loss modulus domi-nates the storage modulus at a certain degree of crosslinking. Samples with a higher initial crosslinking density will reach this point at higher temperatures, assuming the same relative activation state and temperature dependent equilibrium.', 'The two signals are also observable for the corresponding IPNs with the same observable trends. However, there is a clear temperature shift of those signals compared to the model systems, which is probably caused by the additional network in these samples, as it has also been shown for other IPNs in the literature.46 Interestingly, in the case of MP-2d no maximum of tan(δ) could be identified, while for the corres-ponding IPN three maxima are observable.', 'In addition to the two processes above, the third at higher temperature (150 °C) might be induced by the additional poly-styrene backbone and/or the more stable bis-Tpy crosslinks.', 'Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) represents another method to measure thermal transitions within the polymers and IPNs. For P1 a Tg of 18 °C could be determined, while P3d revealed Tg of 104 °C. These glass transition temperatures are within the expected range based on the utilized main mono-mers BMA and styrene.47,48 In contrast no Tg was observable for all linear polymers containing EHMA. For the methacry-late-based IPNs (IPN-a and IPN-b) an increase of the glass tran-sition (from 30 to 44 °C) could be found within an increase of thecrosslinkingdensityoftheswitchingphase. Simultaneously, an increase in crosslinking density seems to fade out any visible glass transition within the DSC curves. While the curves are in general difficult to evaluate (Tg of IPNa needed to be evaluated from the second heating cycle) IPN-c and IPN-d showed no observable Tg, at all. In contrast, DMTA revealed tan(δ) maxima in all cases. The respective DSC traces may indicate a thermal transition, which however feature a too low intensity to be evaluated properly. In this context the tan (δ) method can be regarded as a more sensitive method and provides better insight in temperature dependent processes.', 'All TGA, DSC and DMTA plots as well as a summary of the detected temperatures during those measurements are pre-sented in the ESI (see Fig. S8–S29 and Tables S4–S6†).', 'Shape-memory ability', 'The investigation of shape-memory abilities requires an initial processing step to predetermine the permanent shape of the IPNs. This step was performed analogously to literature procedures,33–35 leading to rectangular polymer specimen (see photo in Fig. 4a) which represent a suitable form for manual tests as well as thermo-mechanical analyses. Subsequently, within manual tests the general ability of the IPNs to reveal a shape-memory effect was investigated. During those manual tests (Fig. S35†) it was already observable that the shape-memory abilities of the IPNs strongly depend on the pyridine content of P3. IPN-a, which was prepared using P3a (2% Py) stayed in the temporary shape even though the recovery step was triggered, while IPN-c, which contained P3c (10% Py), showed a full restorage of the original form within a few seconds. Exemplarily, a photo-series of the manual test for the sample IPN-c is displayed in Fig. 4a.', 'In order to quantify the shape-memory abilities of all IPNs, thermo-mechanical analysis (TMA) followed the manual test. Within these measurements, it is possible to calculate the strain fixity (Rf) and strain recovery rates (Rr) according to eqn (1) and (2), which indicate the quality of the fixation of the temporary form as well as the recovery step to the original form. The calculations are based on shear strain percentages (γ), which are recorded during the TMA. The permanent shape (γA) serves as reference point for the measurement and is con-sequently 0%.', 'Rf ¼ γB=γB;prog: �100%', 'Rr ¼ ðγB;prog: – γA;rec:Þ=ðγB;prog: – γAÞ �100%', 'For the temporary shape two different values are defined. γB, prog. represents the shear strain after applying torsional stress at the switching temperature, while γB stands for the shear strain after fixation (cooling) and release of the shear stress. Finally, γA, rec. reveals the remaining shear strain in the specimen after the recovery step. For each IPN four consecutive cycles were recorded without reprocessing the samples in between. In each case a significantly lower recovery rate could be determined in the first cycle, while Rr is slightly increasing through the cycles.', '@', '@', 'This behavior is well-known in literature for SMPs and can be ascribed to remaining residual stress as well as thermal history of the specimen.49 Furthermore, this observation pro-vides strong evidence for the stability and absence of cross-interactions between the utilized binding motifs in addition to the spectroscopic findings. A potential metal-exchange would resultinshiftedbindingaffinities,and,consequently, decreased shape-memory performance due to unintended acti-vation of the stable phase. Such behavior cannot be observed during thermal cycling. This obtained result is also in line with previous measurements in solution, which revealed a selective formation of ZnTPP-Py and bis-terpyridine systems simultaneously.38', 'Exemplarily, the resulting 3D-TMA plot of the second cycle for IPN-c is presented in Fig. 4a. Furthermore, all calculated recovery rates are presented and compared in Fig. 4b. Further information as well as all TMA plots are presented in the ESI (Table S7 and Fig. S29–S33†). While every tested sample showed excellent fixity rates (near 100%), the TMA measure-ments confirmed the assumption, already made in the manual test. A clear structure–property-relationship, relating recovery and crosslinking density, is visible. The poor shape-memory abilities of IPN-a can easily be explained by its overall composition.', 'As mentioned before, P3a is not able to really form the second network with P2-Zn, due to the low Py-content. For this reason, IPN-a should not be able to form an interpenetrating polymer network structure. Instead, a semi-IPN in which a network of P1 and the iron(II)-ions is formed, which is inter-spersed with supramolecular connected graft polymer chains out of P3a and P2-Zn. The fact that this semi-IPN has extre-mely poor shape-memory properties provides evidence that the IPN structure, based on the supramolecular bonding, is essen-tial for the shape-memory effect. Besides that, an increasing crosslinkingdensityoftheswitchingphase(ZnTPP-Py network) appears to be beneficial for the shape-memory process. IPN-b (5% Py) still reveals good recovery rates up to 87% while excellent values could be obtained for IPN-c (10% Py, Rr = 93%). Presumably a higher crosslinking density is cau-sative for a larger difference in flexibility of the switching unit between the fixed and activated (dynamic) state, which influ-ences the shape-memory behavior.', 'Furthermore, the crosslinking density also affects the optimal switching temperature, since more thermal energy is required to obtain flexibility in the specimen. Since in all of the upper IPNs the switching phase is solely build up by EHMA-based copolymers (EHMA is known to induce a rela-tively low glass transition),47 the required switching tempera-tures may be predominantly effected by the nature and content of the labile ZnTPP-Py complexes.', 'In the case of IPN-d, the additional styrene backbone of P3-d provides a higher Tg. Hence, the thermal properties of the switching phase are presumably determined by an interplay between this glass transition and the metal–ligand crosslinks, resulting in an increased optimal switching temperature of 90 °C, even though the crosslinking density is identical to IPN-c. Thus, the implementation of a mixed network as switching phase (enabled by the utilization of a heteroleptic binding motif) offers the possibility to further adjust the usable switch-ing temperatures.', 'Rewriting potential', 'Since the presented IPNs are based on two orthogonal metal ligand interactions, the materials feature additional smart pro-perties beside single one-way shape-memory behavior. The bis-terpyridine-iron(II)-complexes(crosslinksofthestable network/phase) remain stable during the upper TMA cycles, but can still be activated at even higher temperatures. Under these circumstances the material should exhibit a vitrimer-like behavior enabling a complete reprocessing of the samples as well as the possibility to rewrite the permanent shape.', 'In order to investigate this, the sample of IPN-c (utilized for TMA) was grinded manually into granules. Subsequently, the material was hot-pressed again (see ESI†) into a rectangular specimen under identical conditions, which was further inves-tigated by TMA (sample IPN-c*). An initial TMA cycle was per-formed to erase remaining residual stress and thermal history resulting from the reprocessing step. The following second cycle is displayed in Fig. 5. IPN-c* revealed still a very good Rf close to 100% as well as a Rr of 86%, which represents only a slight decrease compared to the value obtained from the second TMA cycle of IPN-c (90%). These findings clearly demonstrate a reprocessability of the sample without a signifi-cant loss of shape-memory properties.', 'After thermo-mechanical characterization, the specimen was heated to 110 °C, which leads again to an activation (induced mobility due to partial decomplexation and/or ligand exchange) of the more stable Tpy complexes, enabling a per-manent deformation and, thus, a rewriting of the permanent shape. This was realized by twisting in opposite direction until a torsional shear strain of −25% was reached (Fig. 5, γA, rewr.).', 'The efficiency of this reprogramming step (Effrewr.) can be determined as the fixity of the rewritten permanent shape, cal-culated according to eqn (3), where γA,rec. represents the remaining shear strain of the preceding TMA cycle. γA2, rewr. displays the defined negative torsion (−25%) and γA2 the remaining shear strain after fixation (cooling).', 'Effrewr: ¼ ðγA;rec: – γA2Þ=ðγA;rec: – γA2;rewr:Þ �100%', 'The rewriting process of IPN-c* was found to be highly efficient (Effrewr. = 98%). In order to examine the ability of the sample to recover the new permanent shape, an additional TMA cycle was recorded (Fig. 5, t > 7500 s). The procedure of this measurement is identical to the previous TMA, just utiliz-ing the rewritten shape (γA2) as reference point. It is clearly visible that the observed recovery step exceeds the initial per- manent form (γA = 0%) and the rewritten permanent shape is restored. A Rr of 78% could be determined, which appears to be low at first glance. Keeping in mind that the performed measurement represents an initial TMA cycle after processing, the value needs to be compared with Rr of IPN-c, which was obtained in the first TMA cycle (84%). In this context, also only a slight decline in shape-memory ability is observable.', '@', '@', 'The results indicate that rewriting of the permanent shape based on the more stable Tpy complexes is feasible and does not negatively influence the shape-memory properties in a drastic manner.', 'Experimental part', 'Materials and methods', 'All chemicals were used as received from TCI (Eschborn, Germany), Sigma Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany), Alfa Aesar (Kandel, Germany), Thermo Fisher Scientific (Geel, Belgium) and Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium) if not otherwise stated.

Firstly, different linear poly-mers were synthesized bearing terpyridine-, zinc-tetraphenyl porphyrin- or pyridine side-groups. By simply mixing those polymers together with iron sulfate, interpenetrating metallo-polymer networks were obtained due to the orthogonality of the two different complexes. The desired complex formation was proven via FT-Raman spectroscopy. The structure–prop- erty-relationships of all samples were investigated in a detailed fashion by thermogravimetric analysis as well as thermo-mechanical investigations. In particular, the thermo-mechani-cal analysis revealed a strong correlation of the shape-memory abilities and the overall composition of the IPNs. These material properties, in combination with spectroscopic data and previous investigations in solution,38 strongly indicate the remaining orthogonality of the applied binding motifs during the shape-memory process.', 'The results also clearly exhibit that the crosslinking density of the switchable polymer networks is crucial for shape memory capabilities and can easily be tuned by the incorpor-ation of a heteroleptic metal-complex. Moreover, this structural feature enables the fabrication of IPNs, incorporating three different polymers at the same time, in our case: BMA, 2-EHMA and styrene. In this context it was possible to include multiple polymers in a single phase of the resulting shape-memory materials.Furthermore,theincorporationoforthogonal addressable metal-complexes as a structural feature enables the fabrication of IPNs which are fully recyclable and rewritable.', 'Author contributions', 'Synthesis: T.

In this study, we employed thecontrolled ring-opening copolymerization of oxetane with sulfur-containing comonomers to construct a series of amphiphilic block copolymers featuring thioester and thiocarbonate functionalities. These copo-lymers self-assemble in aqueous solution into aggregates with a sulfur-rich core capable of coordinatingtransition metals. This behavior could be resolved by employing cryo-transmission electron tomography and then extended to complexes incorporating functional coligands. Our study demonstrates how selec-tive catalysis can be harnessed to produce functional polymers with tunable metal coordination pro-perties, paving the way for an emerging class of sulfur-containing copolymers.', 'Introduction', 'Sulfur-containing polymers can show unique properties and functions their all-oxygen analogues do not exhibit, which are associated with the chemistry of the incorporated sulfur atoms.1–5 For example, due to their chemically soft nature, sulfur-containing copolymers are prime candidates for the binding of transition metals via coordinative L-type inter-actions with transition metals.6 This phenomenon has been appliedinnumerousexamplesinthesequestrationof aqueous transition metal impurities, with chemically soft late d-block metals being most strongly bound.7–10 Typically, binding has been utilized in a spatially uncontrolled fashion, meaning that transition metals end up randomly coordinated within a solid polymer matrix. This is perhaps owed to the cir-cumstance that patterned templates to spatially control the coordination, such as block polymers, are hard to access via current polymerization methodologies. Sulfur-containing poly-mers, such as polythioesters and polythiocarbonates, are often synthesized via polycondensation methodologies which only offer access to a limited number of polymer structures and polymer topology.2,3 In this respect much recent work focused on the ring-opening copolymerisation (ROCOP) of a strained heterocycle with an heteroallene such as carbon disulfide (CS2), carbonyl sulfide (COS), isothiocyanates (RNCS, R = aryl, aryl) or thioanhydrides, which give access to sulfur-containing monomers via a chain-growth rather than a step-growth mechanismfromoftencommerciallyaccessible monomers.11–27 Additionally, for sulfur-containing polymers resulting synthesized through these methodologies, examples of metal binding exist such as recent reports on the sequestra-tion of lead from aqueous solutions.28', 'As part of our recent efforts in sulfur-containing ROCOP, we found that the monomer combination of oxetane with either phenylisothiocyanate (PhNCS), phthalic thioanhydride (PTA) or CS2 yields poly(monothioimidocarbonates), poly(ester-alt-thioester)andpoly(dithiocarbonates)respectively (Fig. 1(a)).29–31 Moving from epoxides to oxetane (OX) results insubstantiallymorecontrolledpolymerizationsas primary chain-ends are formed for which propagation is thermodynamicallymorefavoured.Thisledtohighly sequence-selective polymerizations that yield high molecular weight semi-crystalline materials with field-leading melting points of up to 181 °C.32 The chemistry of these novel sulfur-containing copolymers as for example their capability to coor-dinate transition metals remains to be explored. Preliminary experiments in the case of PhNCS suggested the suitability of these methods for block polymer formation via a macro-chain transfer strategy (Fig. 1(b)) that could be employed in self-assembly to form micellar aggregates. However, the extent to which this is transferable to other sulfur-containing ROCOP comonomers remained unresolved. In principle, the formation of these sulfur-containing block copolymers could give access to polymer structures that can spatially confine the coordi-nation of transition metals via combination of the sulfur-con-taining ROCOP block with a non-coordinating block, which we report in this contribution (Fig. 1(c)).', '@', '@', 'Our study begins by surveying all recently developed oxetane-based ROCOPs for block polymer formation. For this α-Me,ω-OH terminated polyethylene glycol (mPEG-OH, sup-plied with a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 5 kDa, 20 eq.) was employed as a macro-chain transfer agent to a polymerization containing 1000 eq. of oxetane and 1000 eq. of arylisothiocyanates (ArNCS), PTA or CS2 respectively per equi-valent of catalyst at 80 °C. Aryl isothiocyanates with different substituents(C6H5(PhNCS),4-methyl-C6H4(MePhNCS), 4-fluoro-C6H4(FPhNCS),3,5-bistrifluoromethyl-C6H4 (CF3PhNCS)) and a chromium(III) based catalyst that has shown quantitative polymerization and >95% linkage selectivity in these types of polymerizations previously were employed.31 In this process, the extension of mPEG-OH by the oxetane copoly-mers occurs on the basis that the alcohol chain ends are deprotonated in situ by catalyst-bound alkoxide intermediates formed from oxetane ring-opening. Hereby, a mPEG alkoxide is transferred onto the catalyst and thereafter propagates to attach the sulfur-containing block, which we established pre-viouslywiththecombinationofoxetaneandPhNCS. Conceptually, mPEG-OH functions as a macro-chain transfer agent.33a Following complete oxetane consumption (as estab-lished by spectroscopic analysis of aliquots) in the respective ROCOPs outlined in Table 1, the resulting polymer was easily isolated by precipitation from methanol. 1H NMR analysis of the purified polymers indicates successful block polymer syn-thesis showing a set of resonances between 4.0 and 1.8 ppm corresponding to ring-opened oxetane as well as resonances for aryl hydrogens in addition to the signals corresponding to mPEG at 3.6 ppm. An integrative ratio of 2.4 to 3.4 repeat units of the ROCOP copolymer per repeat unit of the mPEG block is observed. Importantly, the integrative ratio for the two respect-ive blocks remains unchanged after precipitation of a polymer solution in dichloromethane into methanol. The latter rep-resents a good solvent for mPEG but a poor solvent for the stand-alone ROCOP copolymers so that if the respective blocks were not covalently attached, one would precipitate preferen-tially, thereby changing the ratio of polymers in the mixture. 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) reveals that an alternating microstructure of the ROCOP block is obtained for both PTA and all ArNCS, with no signs of ether linkages formation or scrambling from oxygen/sulfur exchange processes.', 'Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) in tetrahydrofuran compared to a narrow polystyrene standard reference shows an increase in the apparent molecular weight relative to the mPEG macroinitiator (see ESI Fig. S36†) and narrow dispersity values of Đ = 1.1–1.3 in all cases qualitatively supporting block polymer formation. Although dispersity values are low, distri-butionsarenotperfectlymonomodal(seeforexample Fig. 2(b)) visible as, for example, shoulders at the higher mole-cular weight part of the GPC trace. Furthermore, some broad-ening is observed compared to the macroinitiator. This can be tentatively explained by side reactions resembling transesterifi-cation as well as chain end-coupling and an exemplary reac-tion pathway is shown in the ESI (Scheme S6†).33b Hence it is unlikely that the sample exclusively comprises diblock archi-tectures. As summarized in Table 1, the apparent molecular weights by GPC are lower than those determined by NMR pre-sumably due to the differences in chemical structure with respect to the polystyrene standard.', 'Furthermore, the thermal properties of the polymers also support the block formation. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) first heating scans of the as-synthesized 4-F-PhNCS (Fig. S8†), 4-Me-PhNCS (Fig. S17†), and PTA-derived block poly-mers (Fig. S27†) show two distinct melting points for the mPEG and the sulfur-containing blocks. As in the case of the stand-alone ROCOP copolymer, the crystallization from the melt of the sulfur-containing block is very slow. Therefore, thematerialcouldnotcrystallizefromthemelt,even when employing rates as low as 1 °C min−1.

In the corresponding DSC second heating scans, the temperature region corres-ponding to the melting of the sulfur-containing block shows a flat baseline, as these blocks could not crystallize during cooling but also do not exhibit cold crystallization. Fig. S17† shows that for the mPEG-b-(OX-co-MePhNCS) copolymer, the mPEG block exhibits cold crystallization during the second heating scan, followed by melting. However, once again no crystallization or melting could be observed for the sulfur-con-taining blocks.', 'To accelerate the crystallization of the slow-crystallizing sulfur-containing blocks, we have modified the classical self-nucleation protocol to allow the sample to crystallize.35 In the modified self-nucleation strategy,31 the existing crystals in the as-obtained samples are partially melted (see Fig. S1†). The remaining crystal fragments or self-seeds can efficiently nucleate these sulfur-con-taining blocks upon cooling from the self-seeding temperature. In this way, crystallization from the self-seeded melt was observed for the MePhNCS derived copolymers.30,31 The DSC cooling scans from three characteristic self-nucleating temperatures for the mPEG-b-(OX-co-FPhNCS) copolymer are presented in Fig. S9† (left) together with the subsequent heating scans (Fig. S9,† right). The appearance of an exotherm corresponding to the sulfur-con-taining block crystallization can be clearly observed, and the size of the exotherm increases, as expected, with the decrease in the self-nucleation temperature (as a higher number of self-seeds are produced at lower self-nucleation temperatures). In the sub-sequent heating scans, the cold crystallization of the mPEG block can be observed (for two of the self-nucleation temperatures employed), followed by the melting of these crystals at around 40 °C. At higher temperatures, the melting endotherms corres-ponding to the sulfur-containing block crystals can be clearly observed at around 150 °C. These results demonstrate the effec-tiveness of the modified self-nucleation protocol (illustrated in Fig. S1†) in accelerating the overall crystallization of the sulfur-containing blocks. Similar self-nucleation results are presented for the other block copolymers in Fig. S18, S27, and S34.†', 'Furthermore, a stepwise decomposition profile in the thermogravimetric analysis is observed for the isothiocyanate-derivedblockcopolymerscorrespondingtothethermal decomposition of the two respective blocks with the ROCOP block decomposing before the mPEG block. However, not all of the recently developed oxetane ROCOPs tolerate chain transfer agents and block polymerization was not as successful with CS2, although without a macro chain-transfer agent, the polymeriz-ation is highly controlled, delivering poly(dithiocarbonate).29Instead, a complex mixture of different (thio)carbonate linkages is formed alongside small-molecule cyclic thiocarbonate bypro-ducts. Furthermore, GPC analysis of the crude mixture does not reveal an increase in the apparent molecular weight compared to the starting mPEG-OH polymer. These observations can be interpreted in light of recent findings showing that CS2 ROCOP is more prone to side reactions originating from alkoxide chain ends than other sulfur-containing ROCOPs. We infer that chain-transfer agents promote the dissociation of alkoxide chain ends from the catalyst through competitive binding to the catalyst, which subsequently leads to linkage scrambling and cyclic thio-carbonate formation via attack on polymer linkages by the dis-sociated alkoxide.36', 'With a range of block polymers in hand, we studied their self-assembly behavior in water, as the mPEG block is water-soluble while the oxetane-derived blocks are not. For this purpose, the respective block polymer was dissolved in 1,4-dioxane and then added dropwise into water under vigorous stirring. As previously observed for the mPEG-b-(PhNCS-co-OX) polymer, a cloudy but homogeneous solution was formed by nanoprecipitation for all block polymers.31 Dynamic light scat-tering (DLS) experiments suggest the presence of nano-objects with sizes between 69 and 269 nm. Although solutions of the different assembled polymers are all stable over time, they show different stabilities with respect to concentration. To investigate this, DLS-supported dilution experiments were conducted to monitor the evolution of the light scattering intensity, steadily decreasing the concentration of the polymers. As the light scat-tering intensity is proportional to the concentration of a scatter-ing species, this approach efficiently determines the critical con-centration at which the aggregates remain stable prior to disas-sembly. Compared to other techniques, such as fluorescence, DLS has the advantage of allowing a label-free determination of the critical concentration. This not only simplifies determi-nation but also excludes secondary effects between the label (or cargo) and the polymer to influence outcomes, hence not deli-vering the true stability of the pure aggregates. Although there is some uncertainty due to a gradual transition from a signal decrease to the plateau region in some of the DLS traces of the block polymers, they all exhibit excellent stabilities of below 2 mg L−1 which can rival some of the most performant, highly engineered systems in the literature.34 However, in contrast to those, our copolymers are obtained from simple and in most cases, commercially available or easy-to-synthesize building blocks in a one-pot fashion and are hence attractive candidates for applications. Furthermore, we find that the mPEG-b-(PhNCS-co-OX) exhibits a lower critical concentration and hence higher stability than other aggregates, which can be tentatively attribu-ted to more pronounced π–π interactions within the aggregates as has been previously described for highly stable micelles fea-turing an aromatic core.34', 'Accordingly, we thereafter focused our attention on coordi-nation and encapsulation studies employing the assembled mPEG-b-(PhNCS-co-OX) polymer. In order to confirm whether the sulfur-containing block is capable of coordinating tran-sition metals, we first investigated the reaction of the stand-alone PhNCS-co-OX copolymer. Thus, the copolymer was reacted with bright orange bis(benzonitrile)palladium(II)chlor-ide ((PhCN)2PdCl2) featuring easily displaceable benzonitrile coligands and chemically soft PdII for sulfur coordination (Fig. 3(a)). In fact, the addition of a saturated (PhCN)2PdCl2 solution in CH3Cl to a solution of the copolymer results in the immediate precipitation of a dark orange solid, which is in-soluble in all common non-coordinating solvents. While the color change already immediately indicates palladium coordi-nation within the precipitate, energy-dispersive X-ray spec-troscopy (EDX) in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used as a quick test to justify the continuation of the experi-ment. Since no film could be cast due to a lack of solvent and the sample was only to be pressed at room temperature, the surface quality was sufficient for SEM/EDX (see Fig. S38†). The line intensities differ locally due to the roughness but are qualitatively unambiguous and identify the elements Pd and Cl in addition to the elements of the polymer.', '@', '@', 'Motivated by this finding, we then turned to coordinating Pd within our aggregates. Therefore, mPEG-b-(PhNCS-co-OX) was dissolved with 20 wt% (PhCN)2PdCl2 with respect to the polymer in 1,4-dioxane and then added dropwise into water under vigorous stirring. Gratifyingly, a stable orange colloidal solution forms, exhibiting a Tyndall effect. DLS reveals a size increase of the aggregates from 126 nm (without PdCl2) to 170 nm, suggesting some morphological adjustment due to loading with the metal salt, thereby supporting encapsulation. Since we suspected that not all PdCl2 was bound during pre-cipitation, we subjected the aggregates to size exclusion chromatography (SEC). As schematically illustrated in Fig. 3(b) we observed the elution of a sharp orange band corresponding to aggregates with PdCl2 while free palladium salt remained on top of the column.', 'Cryo-transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) reveals the morphology of the aggregates under native, hydrated con-ditions rather than dried conditions. Spherical aggregates were observed to merge into elongated worm-like aggregates with an approximate length of 100 to 300 nm and a thickness of 20–40 nm, which were, however, too irregular for statistical evaluation. The elongated worm-like aggregates consist of mul-tiple merging micelles rather than regular cylindrical structures suggesting that the sulfur-containing cores are likely amorphous in nature rather than semi-crystalline. Interestingly, regions of increased electron density in the aggregates are observed, visible as black dots in the images presented in Fig. 3. These likely correspond to the encapsulated PdCl2 as regions rich in palla-dium, a second-row transition metal, exhibit higher electron densitythanthesurroundingareascomprisinglighter elements. Hence, the encapsulated PdCl2 appears to form dis-crete clusters within the polymer aggregates. We then turned to cryo-electron tomography to spatially resolve where PdCl2 resides. As shown in Fig. 3 areas of increased electron density, highlighted in gold, could be identified in the 3D volume recon-structed from tilt series images (±64°, with 2° increment), and which are highly suspected to be PdCl2. These do not appear to be homogeneously distributed throughout the nanostructure but much rather form a shell around the interior. This could either be due to the coordination of palladium on the surface of a micellar core or within the interior of a vesicular morphology.', 'Having demonstrated the coordination capability of our block polymers, we proceeded to investigate the coordinative encapsulation of complex fragments featuring functional coli- gands. Here, the [(bipyridine)2Ru]2+ was chosen, as it contains coligands that induce phosphorescent metal-to-ligand charge transfer(MLCT)transitions.(Bipyridine)2Ru(BArF)2with hydrophobictetrakis(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)borate (BArF) counteranions was employed in encapsulation studies to support encapsulation within the hydrophobic interior of the aggregates with this hydrophobic counter anion.', 'Initially, the possibility of polymer coordination to the ruthenium complex investigated spectroscopically in a block-non-selective solvent by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Interestingly, the 1H NMR resonances of (bipyridine)2Ru(BArF)2 in CDCl3 exhibit substantial shifting and broadening upon addition of the copolymer with those closest to the ruthenium center being most affected. This clearly indicates a change in coordi-nation environment of the metal and hence coordination of the polymer to ruthenium.', 'Therefore,mPEG-b-(PhNCS-co-OX)wasdissolvedwith 40 wt% ruthenium complex with respect to polymer in 1,4-dioxane and then added dropwise into water under vigorous stirring, forming a turbid luminescent solution (Fig. 4). Importantly, the complex itself is not water-soluble meaning that the homogeneity of the mixture immediately indicates encapsulation into the aggregates. DLS reveals a size of 122 nm for these, and Cryo-TEM shows a spherical mor-phology with a homogeneous electron density distribution throughout the aggregate suggesting a uniform distribution of the complex.', 'Encapsulation is clearly indicated by the optoelectronic pro-perties of the assembly. While (bipyridine)2Ru(BArF)2 in CH3CN solvent shows an emission maximum at approximately 560 nm, it is shifted to 600 nm for the ruthenium complex encapsulated. Having evidenced ruthenium encapsulation, we turned to example applications, such as the generation of singlet oxygen, which is useful in the context of photocatalysis for pollution remediation or organic transformations.37,38 For this, ruthenium-loaded micelles in a buffer solution contain-ing 9,10-anthracenediyl-bis(methylene)dimalonic acid, a dye sensitive to singlet oxygen, were irradiated at 440 nm and ultraviolet–visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra were recorded every 5 minutes.39 As shown in Fig. 4(c) a continuous intensity decrease over time is observed for the diagnostic absorption bands of the dye between 320 and 420 nm clearly demonstrat-ing the capability of our micellar system to produce singlet oxygen.', 'In conclusion, we have presented a series of block polymer syntheses in which sulfur-containing oxetane ROCOP polymers were attached to mPEG via a macro-chain transfer strategy. While a variety of isothiocyanates, as well as phthalic thioanhy-dride, successfully facilitated block polymer formation, side reactions during CS2 ROCOP were exacerbated by the presence of chain-transfer agents. Most block polymers exhibited phase separation in the bulk, resulting in two distinct melting points observed in DSC experiments.

Detailed kinetic experiments were conducted to monitor the homo- andcopolymerization of ε-CL with 7-(prop-2-ynyl)oxepan-2-one. By analyzing the kinetic data, we calcu-lated the copolymerization parameters and mapped the composition profile of the resulting copolymers. The resulting gradient copolymers exhibited a lightly tapered composition profile, with an increase in ε-CL consumption at higher conversions where the more reactive 7-(prop-2-ynyl)oxepan-2-one is almostdepleted. These findings were further validated through quantum chemical calculations, providing insights into the precise structure and composition of the copolymers. Characterization of the self-assemblednanoparticles was performed using static and dynamic light scattering, and their morphology was visual-ized via conventional and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, confirming the formation of small, homogeneous spherical micelles. To demonstrate their potential in drug delivery, we combined a modeldrug consisting of a phenylboronic acid-conjugated metallacarborane cluster with diblock copolymer,utilizing reversible bonding between diols and phenylboronic acid and investigated the impact of drug loading on nanoparticle properties. Our comprehensive study underscores the importance of precise syn-thesis and structural prediction in the development of biodegradable diblock copolymers, offering valu-able insights into their synthesis, kinetic behavior, and nanoscale assembly for advanced drug delivery applications.', 'Introduction', 'Amphiphilic block copolymers are versatile materials compris-ing two or more chemically distinct and typically immiscible covalently bonded blocks. By changing these blocks or their order, length, or incompatibility, the material properties can be easily tuned for specific applications. Such a convenient adjustability has prompted their use in diverse fields including tissue engineering, cell encapsulation, gene therapy and drug delivery.1,2 Many drug polymeric delivery systems (DDSs) have been produced with poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and its copoly-mers due to their relative affordability, high permeability to numerous drugs, excellent biocompatibility, and ability to be fully excreted from the body once bioresorbed.3–5 Well-defined PCLs with narrow molar mass distributions are formed by ε-CL ring-opening polymerization (ROP) routinely catalyzed by FDA-approved tin(II) ethylhexanoate (stannous octoate, SnOct2),6–9 using an mPEG macroinitiator in order to obtain blockcopolymers.Inthisregard,mPEG-b-PCL-based nanoDDSs with a high encapsulation efficiency (EE) have been prepared for various active compounds (177–1269 g mol−1, X log P3 −9.9 to 7.5)10,11 including poorly soluble sulforaphane and paclitaxel. The loading content of the latter increases with the length of the hydrophobic PCL block.12', 'Considerable research efforts have been made to modify synthetic polyesters to tackle their main limitations, namely inherent hydrophobicity and lack of chemical functionalities between the backbone ester groups.13 The solution is the modification of the polyester backbone with adequate func-tional groups that can be attached via polymerization of pre-functionalizedmonomers,14–17post-polymerization modifications18–20 or the combination of both methods.21–25Combined synthetic pathways are based on functionalized monomers that are suitable for subsequent click reactions, such as thiol–ene or thiol–yne click reactions.26–29 One of the appropriate monomers for the thiol–yne click reaction is pro-pargyl substituted ε-caprolactone (PgCL). This monomer is typically produced as an isomeric mixture of 3- and 7-(prop-2-ynyl)oxepan-2-ones (3- and 7-isomers) containing 30% of the 3-isomer and it has been widely used in biomedical appli-cations of the respective (co)polymers.29–36', 'In cancer therapy, conventional low-molecular therapeutics exhibit unfavorable pharmacokinetics, suboptimal biodistribu-tion, short blood half-life and prominent off-target, resulting in severe side effects. In comparison, nanoparticle formu-lations of the desired size (over 40 kDa to exceed the renal clearance threshold) show reduced kidney excretion and there-fore prolonged circulation half-life. The half-life can be further improved by coating the nanoparticles with stealth polymers. Notably, poly(ethylene glycol) coatings are extensively used to prevent aggregation and opsonization with plasma proteins.37Several types of boron-containing compounds are frequently considered for cancer treatment, such as boronic acids and boron clusters.38 Boronic acids (BAs) are inherently electron-deficient organoboron compounds due to a vacant p-orbital on the boron atom. In aqueous media, hydroxyl groups act as Lewis bases interconverting the sp2-hybridized form of BAs to a tetrahedral sp3 hydroxyboronate anion in a pH-dependent equilibrium. Although both forms bind to 1,2- and 1,3-diols, boronate esters formed by the latter are more hydrolytically stable.39 Despite being highly reactive, BAs show remarkable stability and a very low toxicology profile.40 Owing to these pro-perties, BAs are employed as stimuli-responsive groups, as tar-geting ligands, and as therapeutics. In BA-containing materials for drug delivery, not only pH but also reactive oxygen species (ROS) and diols such as sugars and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) can be used as release triggers.41–43', 'Boron clusters are polyhedral boron hydrides whose high boron content makes them suitable for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT).38 Upon irradiation with thermal neutrons, boron-10 atoms yield recoiling lithium-7 nuclei and alpha par-ticles which destroy biologically active molecules, such as DNA, RNA, and proteins. The short path of these particles (approxi- mately one cell in diameter – 10–14 μm) and the weak hydrogen and nitrogen capture cross-section limit damage to normal tissue.44 Nevertheless, delivering boronated compounds to a tumor while avoiding significant uptake in normal tissues and adsorption to plasma proteins remains a challenge.45 A promis-ing strategy for overcoming these drawbacks is integrating boron clusters with polymeric delivery systems.38', 'Thus, we prepared several diblock copolymers mPEG-b-P(ε-CL-co-PgCL) bearing propargyl pendant groups. The sub-sequent modification of reactive triple bonds via a thiol–yne click reaction with 1-thioglycerol yielded copolymers bearing vicinal diols, which can reversibly bind to boronic acid deriva-tives. Additionally, we studied the kinetic profile of ε-CL/PgCL copolymerization and characterized the self-assembled nano-particles by static and dynamic light scattering. The formation of small, homogeneous spherical micelles was visualized using conventional (negatively stained samples) and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. Finally, we encapsulated a newly synthesized model drug, COSAN-pyridinium-3-boronic acid conjugate, into spherical micelles and investigated the effect of drug loading on these particles.', 'Results and discussion', 'Synthesis and characterization of mPEG-b-P(ε-CL-co-PgCL) copolymers', 'The synthesis of mPEG-b-P(ε-CL-co-PgCL) was performed in one pot with a reaction mixture of twice azeotropically distilled mPEG as a macroinitiator and ε-CL/PgCL as comonomers.

At the beginning, we performed the pre-liminary screening to map the effect of the reaction time and irradiation intensity on the molar mass, its distribution and the DS of the resulting polymers. Minimal degradation and the highest functionalization were observed after 65 minutes at 9 mW cm−2, which were taken as standard conditions (Table 2).', 'The adopted reaction conditions resulted in negligible degradation within the modification of diblock copolymers 1a and 1b2 (Table 1). Only a slight decrease of molar mass accompanied by mild broadening of its distribution was observed (Table 2), as shown in Fig. S1(A and B).† The only exception was sample 2c10, containing the longest hydro-phobic block, that showed twice lower molar mass with the increase of dispersity from 1.27 to 1.70 after UV exposure (C, Fig. S1†). This behavior is in line with the previously published data, describing that longer PCL chains are more inclinable to undergo UV degradation.46 However, all diblock copolymers modified with 1-thioglycerol (Table 2) exhibited the same degree of substitution as the starting copolymers (Table 1). Moreover, no double bonds were detected in the 1H NMR spectra (B, Fig. 1). This indicates that each alkyne functional group was reacted with two thiol species, generating a dithioether. These findings are in line with previous obser-vations, upon monitoring the concentration of functional groups by IR spectroscopy.47', 'Kinetics and modeling of the copolymerization of ε-CL and 7-(prop-2-ynyl)oxepan-2-one', 'Furthermore, we thoroughly separated both PgCl isomers (3/7-(prop-2-ynyl)oxepan-2-ones) and performed (co)polymerization kinetic experiments with unsubstituted ε-CL to reveal the mutual reactivity of these species.

The reactivity ratio of both como-nomers was identified by 1H NMR analysis of the reaction mixtures that provided the total monomer conversion and the evolution of monomer feed composition within the copoly-merization reaction. This set of experimental data was pro-cessed with the Integrated Ideal Model (A, Fig. 3). The Integrated Ideal Model was developed by Frey et al.49 and it is derived from Wall’s non-terminal (“ideal”) model,50 describ-ing the ideal copolymerization (r1·r2 = 1). The calculated copolymerization parameters of the ε-CL and 7-isomer couple obtained from the Integrated Ideal Model (rε-CL = 0.36; r7-is = 2.79) confirmed the higher reactivity of the 7-isomer (A, Fig. 3).', 'The same data set (total conversion vs. monomer feed com-position) was also evaluated with the more complex terminal model originally proposed by Mayo and Lewis.51 The differen-tial Mayo–Lewis equation was combined with the Skeist relation52 and converted to the integrated model by Meyer and Lowry.53 The Meyer–Lowry model (Fig. S3†) provided similar copolymerization parameters (rε-CL = 0.28; r7-is = 2.05) to the Integrated Ideal Model (rε-CL = 0.36; r7-is = 2.79, Fig. 3A) without a significant change in the fit quality. Overall, the Integrated Ideal Model can sufficiently describe the experi-mental data, which clearly indicates the ideal copolymeriza-tion of ε-CL with the 7-isomer. The similar copolymerization behavior has been already studied for different monomer systems.49,54,55', 'Copolymerization parameters obtained from the Integrated Ideal Model49 enabled the calculation and further precise display of structural composition along the polymer chain by applying the Skeist model (Table S2† and Fig. 3B).52 The result-ing gradient copolymer showed a lightly tapered composition profile with an increase of the ε-CL consumption at higher conversions where the more reactive 7-isomer is almost ener-vated (B, Fig. 3). Moreover, our kinetic experiments were further supported by quantum chemical calculations.', '@', '@', 'Quantum chemical validation of the kinetics and copolymer structure', 'To support our experimental findings, we conducted quantum chemical calculations. These calculations offered detailed insights into the electronic structure and reactivity of the adopted comonomers, validating the kinetic and compo-sitional data obtained from our experiments. The integration of computational results enhanced our understanding of the copolymer structure and stability.', 'Initial step of the ε-CL ROP. By analogy with our previous paper,55 the studied system consisted of the polymerized monomer (ε-CL), the initiator (BnOH), and TBD acting as a catalyst dissolved in toluene. In this three-compound system, there are possible three bimolecular complexes and one trimo-lecularcomplex,ofwhichtheBnOH–TBDbimolecular complex has the lowest Gibbs free energy. Thus, the energy of this most stable complex was taken as the ground state of the system. Based on the results of previous DFT studies of six-membered and larger cyclic lactones56,57 as well as experi-mental data,56,58 we suppose for the calculation of the ROP reaction route the “donor–acceptor” mechanism B, rather than an alternate “amide” mechanism A.59', 'The calculation of the energy profiles (Table S3a†) of the initial step of the ε-CL ROP started with the conformational analysis of the initial structure I1 and the first transition struc- ture TS12 (see Scheme 1). From all obtained conformers, the one showing the lowest Gibbs free energy of TS12 was selected for a detailed study of the ROP mechanism (Scheme 1). The free energy of the starting structure I1 under vacuum is 2.5 kcal mol−1 above the ground state, which agrees very well with the value of 2.8 kcal mol−1 found by Nifant’ev et al.59 for an analogical complex of ε-CL with methanol and TBD. In toluene, this value increases to 4.6 kcal mol−1. This value is only slightly lower than the free energies of the structure I1 of', '@', '@', '@', '@ the 3-isomer and 7-isomer found in our previous study.55 The free energy of the first transition state TS12 of ε-CL was found to be 21.5 kcal mol−1 under vacuum and 22.3 kcal mol−1 in toluene. Both these values lie between the corresponding ener-gies of the TS12 state of the 3-isomer and 7-isomer. This finding indicates that initiation of the ε-CL as well as 7-isomer reaction will be easier than initiation of the 3-isomer one, which is sterically disfavored by the propargyl group bound next to the reactive carbonyl group. Transformation of the structure I2 into I3 proceeds with a small energy barrier of ca. 2 kcal mol−1 and negligible reaction energy. Then, the struc-ture I3 relaxes to its conformers I3r and I3r2. The free energy of the last transition state TS34 is comparable to that of the first transition state TS12. In toluene solution, the last tran-sition state TS34 is the highest one in energy on the whole reaction path. Thus, similarly to the 7-isomer,55 ε-CL may undergo several forward and reverse reactions between the initial state I1 and the intermediate state I3r2 before crossing the TS34 transition state. However, the energy difference between the first transition state TS12 and the highest tran-sition state on the whole reaction path is only ca. 0.3 kcal mol−1 for ε-CL (in toluene), while it is 1.1 kcal mol−1 for the 7-isomer. Thus, we expect that the reverse reaction and its impact on the polymerization rate are much less significant for ε-CL than for the 7-isomer which is in agreement with the homopolymerization kinetic study (left, Fig. 2). Note that for ε-CL under vacuum, TS12 is the highest transition state. The free energy of the I4 state is 4.2 kcal mol−1 under vacuum and', '@', '@ 7.5 kcal mol−1 in toluene, respectively, i.e. it is much lower than that of the TS34 state. The exothermic reaction from the I4 state to the I5 state consists of straightening of the opened ε-CL ring after cleavage of the weak NH–O hydrogen bond. The free energy of the final state I5 is −1.5 kcal mol−1 under vacuum and 1.2 kcal mol−1 in toluene, respectively, with respect to the ground state. Thus, the entire reaction from I1 to I5 is exothermic with a reaction energy of −3 to −4 kcal mol−1. It should be pointed out that in a solution, the hydro-gen bond cleaved in the reaction I4 →I5 can be replaced by a hydrogen bond to surrounding molecules, which further decreases the reaction energy and disfavors the reverse reac-tion I5 →I1.

Calculations of the energy profiles of the next step of the homopolymerization of ε-CL and its copolymerization with the 3- or 7-isomer were performed in the same way but restricted to toluene solution. The obtained results are presented in Table S3b† and compared with our previous data calculated for the polymerization of the 3- and 7-isomers.55 It was found that the free energy of the first transition state TS12 is the highest one (rate limiting) on the whole reaction path for all combinations of the types of the added isomer units (ε-CL, 3-isomer, and 7-isomer) and the chain ends except for addition of the 3-isomer unit to the chain ending with the 7-isomer unit, for which the transition state TS23 is the highest one.', 'The energy barrier of the subsequent step of the ε-CL homopolymerization reaction (24.9 kcal mol−1) is considerably smaller than that of both other compounds (27.7 and 26.0 kcal mol−1), which agrees with the experimental finding that ε-CL homopolymerization is the fastest one (Fig. 4).

The same effect was previously observed in the copolymerization of the 3-isomer with the 7-isomer.55 On the other hand, in the copolymerization of ε-CL with the 3-isomer, the reactivity of the 3-isomer is expected to be lower than the reactivity of ε-CL, similarly to homopolymerization.

Then, eqn (1) can be rewritten as', 'kCL k7‐is¼ eΔG‡ð7‐isÞ�ΔG‡ðCLÞRT:', 'We see that the experimental value of the ratio of rate con-stants kCL/k7-is is about 1.9, lying between the theoretical values for the initial step 1.2 and for the subsequent steps 6.1, determinedfromtheDFT-calculatedactivationenergies (Table 3) using eqn (2).', 'The experimental (right, Fig. 2) and theoretical (Table S3†) results obtained for copolymerization of ε-CL and the 7-isomer can be compared in the same way. The experimental activation energies ΔG‡exp lie again between the theoretical values for the initial and subsequent steps. The experimental value of the ratio kCL/k7-is is about 0.34. While the theoretical value of this ratio for the initial step is essentially the same as for the homopolymerization (i.e., 1.2), the more important values calculated for the subsequent steps are 0.57 and 0.31, depend-ing on the type of chain end. Since both values are signifi-cantly less than one, we conclude that the quantum chemical calculations support the experimentally observed reverse reac-tivity of ε-CL and the 7-isomer during their homo- and copolymerization.', 'Nanoparticle self-assembly and characterization', 'Amphiphilic diblock copolymers self-assemble into micellar aggregates of different morphologies, which are primarily dic-tated by the ratio between the solvophilic and solvophobic domains and by its effect on chain packing within the aggre-gate.60 It has been established that the preparation method affects the size, its distribution and the stability of poly(ethyl-ene glycol)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone) nanoparticles.61 Thus, the previously published protocol allowing the formation of well-defined and stable nanoparticles, based on injecting of PEG-b-PCL solutions in a 90% THF/water mixture into an excess amount of water and dialysis to water, was adopted.61', 'Light scattering (LS) is a powerful technique for analyzing nanoparticles in solution.62 Static light scattering (SLS), utiliz-ing the angle-independent scattering data enabled the deter-mination of the molecular weight of nanoparticles (Fig. 5A and Table 4), however, it did not provide information on the radius of gyration, as the size of nanoparticles is below the limit of λ/20 (λ = 660 nm as described in the Methods section in the ESI†). To assess how many polymer chains comprise one nanoparticle, we determined the aggregation number Nagg by dividing the molar mass of a nanoparticle by the molar mass of an unimer.', 'The scaling of the mean aggregation number was predicted for diblock copolymers A–B (A represents corona) that form micelles with thin dense coronas (NB ≫NA) and for star-like micelles with extended coronas (NB ≪NA).63,64 Fitting a plot of log Nagg as a function of the logarithm of the number of PCL units (NCL) (B, Fig. 5) yielded the scaling relation Nagg ≈NCLμwhere μ = 0.59. Our experimental scaling exponent was lower than those determined theoretically for either micellar type (μ = 1.0 for micelles with thin coronas and μ = 0.8 for micelles with extended coronas).63 The discrepancy between our experi-ments and theory could be explained by the fact that only sample 2c10 (Table 2) fits to the theoretical condition NB ≫ NA. Moreover, our hydrophobic (B) block does not consist of one type of monomer unit, which is in contrast with the theoretical data.63', '@', '@', 'The apparent size distributions of nanoparticles 2a2, 2b2, and 2c10 calculated from the dynamic light scattering (DLS) data measured at a finite scattering angle 90° were unimodal and very narrow (C, Fig. 5). The only exception was sample 2a2; however, the second distribution is minor, as it is intensity weighted (C, Fig. 5). Their hydrodynamic radii were rather small (in agreement with the angle-independent scattering observed in SLS), increasing slightly with the length of the hydrophobic block (Table 4). The average nanoparticle density was deter-mined according to the following relationship: ρ = 3Mw/ (4πNARh3), where Mw stands for the molar mass of the nano-particles determined by SLS, Rh stands for the corresponding hydrodynamic radius of the nanoparticles, and NA is the Avogadro number. The average densities of the nanoparticles were relatively low. Small hydrodynamic radii accompanied by low aggregation numbers indicate the formation of “fluffy” solvent-swollen nanoparticles. It can be concluded that 2a2, 2b2, and 2c10 formed small spherical micelles.', 'In light scattering, particle size and shape are determined indirectly. Thus, we visualized the prepared nanoparticles for direct and unambiguous size and shape determination via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We performed TEM using negative staining with uranyl acetate to improve the TEM contrast65 and we also performed cryo-TEM. Both of these techniques depicted small, well-dispersed, and homo-geneous spherical micelles of sample 2b2 (Fig. 6) with a micel-lar core of about 7 nm in diameter (as observed in cryo-TEM), shrinked to approximately 4 nm when the sample was dried (classical TEM). The value obtained from cryo-TEM is in a good agreement with the hydrodynamic radius determined by DLS (RH = 14 nm, Table 4), as it corresponds to the whole core–shell nanoparticle, while the PEG hydrophilic corona cannot be visualized by TEM techniques, as soft materials with low atomic numbers do not deflect electron beam sufficiently and exhibit poor scattering contrast.66,67', '@', '@', 'Encapsulation of the model drug', 'As the results of the self-assembly investigation were promising, we further studied the encapsulation of a novel redox probe, COSAN-pyridinium-3-boronic acid conjugate (CosBA). As high-lighted in the Introduction section, both boron clusters and boronic acids are highly relevant for cancer therapy. In the model drug, the high boron content of a boron cluster required for BNCT is combined with pH-responsive binding to 1,2- and 1,3-diols characteristic of boronic acids. Thus, together with the vicinal diol-containing polymeric DDS, significant uptake in normal tissues and adsorption to plasma proteins could be avoided while achieving microenvironment-triggered release.', 'A solution of polymer 2a2, the redox probe CosBA and pyri-dine in dry acetonitrile-d3 was prepared and analyzed using 1H and DOSY NMR in order to investigate the CosBA binding to the diol-decorated polymer. Pyridine was added as a ligand that facilitates the formation of boronic acid ester.68 DOSY signals of the polymer and CosBA were integrated manually for each experiment and fitted with the exponential decay of signal intensities, demonstrating that CosBA is attached to polymer 2a2 (A, Fig. 7).', 'Furthermore, we added glycerol (20 eq. with respect to CosBA) to the solution of the polymer and CosBA. Glycerol has a higher binding affinity towards CosBA in comparison with the diol-decorated polymer,41 resulting in CosBA release from the polymer, as visualized in Fig. 7B. This process was also monitored by 1H NMR (C, Fig. 7), showing the disappearance/ shift of the characteristic CosBA signal at 4.66 ppm when attached to the polymer (black and red curves, Fig. 7). The same signal was observed again after the addition of glycerol (blue curve, Fig. 7C).', 'Finally, we studied how the encapsulation of CosBA affects the nanoparticle characteristics. We dissolved 2a2, 2b2, and 2c10 (1 eq.) and CosBA (0.7, 0.5 and 0.4 eq. per diol-modified ε-CL unit respectively) in THF and then proceeded according to the previously used protocol to prepare nanoparticle solu-tions (Experimental section). The THF/water solutions contain-ing CosBA were intensively yellow. During the dialysis, the dia-lysate remained colorless while the sample inside the dialysis membrane retained its yellow color. No precipitation occurred when the solvent was gradually changed from THF-rich to de-ionized water and for at least two weeks after the nanoparticle preparation. These observations visually confirmed the encap-sulation of CosBA into polymeric micelles as the small mole- cules did not diffuse through the porous membrane or precipi-tate due to its limited solubility.', 'The SLS and DLS experiments of the loaded nanoparticles are summarized in Table 4. Apparent distributions of hydro-dynamic radii at 130° were calculated from the corresponding autocorrelation functions (Fig. S4†).', 'The dispersity of loaded nanoparticles is higher in compari-son with neat ones (C, Fig. 5 vs. Fig. S4†) and, interestingly, significantly decreases with nanoparticle size (Fig. S4†). We observed virtually no effect of drug loading on the smallest micelles (P2a2, Table 4); however, the asymmetric shape of the distribution curve indicates the presence of a particle fraction with larger hydrodynamic radii, unresolved by the applied fit (size ratio below 2 is beyond the resolution of DLS).62Conversely, loading with CosBA significantly affects the other samples. Regarding P2b2 and P2c10, CosBA incorporation results in approximately 20% and 100% increase of hydrodyn-amic radii and the molecular weight with the corresponding aggregation number, respectively. The growth of the micelle does not compensate fully the increase in the number of chains; consequently, the micellar density also increases by approximately 50% (Table 4).', 'Conclusion', 'In conclusion, we prepared diblock copolymers mPEG-b-P(ε-CL-co-PgCL) bearing vicinal diols by the copolymerization of ε-CL with PgCL, followed by the transformation of alkyne moi-etiesviaathiol–yneclickreactionwith1-thioglycerol. Additionally, we studied the kinetic profile of the copolymeri-zation of ε-CL and 7-(prop-2-ynyl)-oxepan-2-one, showing the higher reactivity of the 7-isomer in this comonomer couple which was further verified by quantum chemical calculations.', 'The synthesized amphiphilic diblock copolymers mPEG-b-P (ε-CL-co-PgCL) decorated with vicinal diols allowed the prepa-ration of self-assembled nanoparticles in water, which were characterized by static and dynamic light scattering. The for-mation of small, homogeneous spherical micelles was visual-ized by using conventional and cryogenic transmission elec-tron microscopy.', 'Finally, we encapsulated a newly synthesized model drug, COSAN-pyridinium-3-boronic acid conjugate, into spherical micelles and investigated the effect of drug loading on these particles. The interplay between the model drug and our diblock copolymer was observed by DOSY NMR and light scat-tering methods. Ultimately, these findings will lead to the reproducible preparation of fine-tuned amphiphilic block copolymers capable of binding to boronic acid-based anti-cancer agents.', 'Author contributions', 'All authors wrote the manuscript and approved the final version of the manuscript.
