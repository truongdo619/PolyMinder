Since the spatial distribution of dopants in doped polymer films significantly influences their electrical properties, elucidating how various material parameters affect the dopant distribution in sequentially solution-doped polymer films is of great importance. This study investigates the effect of crystallinity in conjugated polymer thin films on the spatial distribution of dopants along the out-of-plane direction. The results show that higher crystallinity in polymer films leads to a more non-uniform dopant distribution, with a greater composition of dopants at the film surface compared to the bulk. This phenomenon is attributed to the crystallinity-dependent swellability of polymer films, where films with higher crystallinity exhibit lower swellability, resulting in less efficient dopant diffusion from the surface to the bulk compared to films with lower crystallinity.', 'Graphic abstract', 'This study explores how crystallinity in conjugated polymer thin films affects dopant distribution during sequential solution doping, revealing that higher crystallinity results in a more nonuniform distribution, with greater dopant compositions at the surface than in the bulk. This is due to lower swellability, which limits effective dopant diffusion from the surface to the bulk.', '@', 'Keywords Chemical doping · Conjugated polymers · Molecular dopants · Crystallinity · Sequential solution doping', '1 Introduction', 'Conjugated polymers have garnered significant attention in the field of organic electronics due to their unique optoelectronic properties [1–10]. One promising approach to enhance the performance of conjugated polymers is through doping, particularly in the field of polymer electrodes and organic thermoelectrics [3, 7, 11–16]. Doping involves introducing additional molecules into a polymer film to control the charge carrier concentration via charge transfer between them, resulting in changes to the polymer’s optical and electrical properties, such as electrical conductivity, Fermi level, and light absorption coefficients in visible and near-infrared ranges [17–19]. The development of efficient dopants and doping methods, along with a concrete understanding of the underlying principles, is essential for improving the performance of doped conjugated polymers in various applications.', 'Two commonly employed solution-based doping techniques used in the doping of conjugated polymers are mixed-solution doping and sequential solution doping. Mixed-solution doping of a conjugated polymer involves the blending of the polymer and dopant in one solution, followed by the deposition of the blend solution to obtain a doped polymer film [3]. Although this method is advantageous for the precise control of the ratio between the polymer and dopant, it often suffers from severe aggregation of charged polymers within the solution and poor quality of the resulting polymer films [20]. On the other hand, sequential solution doping of a conjugated polymer involves exposing a precast undoped polymer film to a dopant solution for an extended time, which then leads to the diffusion of dopant molecules into the polymer film [21]. This method allows for effective doping of polymer thin films without significantly damaging their microstructure, making it widely used for doping polymer thin films with optimized microstructures [18, 22].', 'Sequential solution doping, despite its advantages, presents some challenges. Since this doping method relies on the diffusion of dopant molecules within the already solidified polymer films, it may take a significant amount of time for the dopant molecules to penetrate deeply into the film [23, 24]. This means that for relatively thick polymer films, the dopant may not diffuse effectively throughout the entire film, resulting in considerable nonuniformity in dopant content and doping levels between the surface region and the bulk of the film. Non-uniform doping in thick polymer films can pose a serious drawback in the application of doped conjugated polymers. For example, in typical Π-structured thermoelectric devices based on conjugated polymers, a thick film is inevitably required to maximize the temperature difference across the device [25,  26]; however, the non-uniform doping in this thick film can lead to a significant deterioration of the thermoelectric performance of the device. In this context, understanding the distribution of dopant molecules within sequentially solution-doped polymer films and the factors influencing this distribution is crucial.', 'this distribution is crucial.Although many studies have revealed the spatial distribution of dopants within sequentially doped conjugated polymer films, they have primarily focused on where the dopants prefer to reside within the crystalline and amorphous regions of polymer films, or on how the inclusion of dopants affects the polymer’s crystalline structure [14–16, 27–30]. In contrast, the distribution of dopants along the thickness direction (i.e., along the out-of-plane direction) has received relatively little attention. A recent study demonstrated that doping of a conjugated polymer film using the immersion doping method leads to a significantly non-uniform dopant distribution along the thickness direction due to the limited diffusivity of dopants within the film [31]. While the study thoroughly examined the dopant diffusion process within a conjugated polymer film, it did not provide insights into how the film’s microstructure influences dopant diffusion behavior and spatial distribution. In this work, we investigate the effect of polymer crystallinity on the dopant distribution along the thickness direction of sequentially solution-doped conjugated polymer films. Using regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as a model conjugated polymer, we characterized the dopant distribution by varying the crystallinity of the polymer film via thermal annealing. Under the same conditions of sequential solution doping, it was found that while the overall dopant content within two polymer films with different degrees of crystallinity was almost similar, the distribution of dopants along the depth direction was different. The film with higher crystallinity exhibited greater nonuniformity in dopant distribution, with the ratio of dopant content between the film surface and bulk being higher in the film with greater crystallinity compared to the film with lower crystallinity. These differences are attributed to different swellabilities of the polymer films due to variations in their crystallinity, which affect the diffusion of dopant molecules within the films during the doping process.', '2 \x07Experimental', '2.1 \x07Materials', 'P3HT with regioregularity of ≥ 90% was purchased from Rieke Metals Inc.

The materials were used without any furtherpurification.', '2.2 \x07Preparation of polymer thin films and their sequential solution doping', 'Either soda-lime glass or a Si wafer with a native oxide was used as the substrates for sample preparation. The substrates were cleaned sequentially with detergent (Extran MA 02, Merck Millipore), deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. The substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 20 min before applying polymer solution on them. The polymer solution (5 mg \xadmL−1) was prepared by dissolving P3HT in CF at 55 °C. Then, the P3HT solution was spin-coated onto the substrates at 2000 rpm for 60 s. The resulting polymer films had a thickness of ~ 47 nm. For thermal annealing, P3HT films were placed on hot plates with a surface temperature of 200 °C for 10 min. For sequential solution doping, the dopant solution was prepared by dissolving F4TCNQ in ACN at room temperature. The concentration of the F4TCNQ dopant solution varied from 0.15 to 2.0 wt%. Doping was performed by dropping the dopant solution onto the polymer film to cover the entire surface and maintaining it for a minute to allow diffusion of dopant molecules into the polymer film. Then, the residual dopant solution was removed by spin-coating. After the doping process, doped polymer films were thermally annealed for 5 min at a mild temperature of 85 °C, which is slightly above the boiling temperature of ACN, to completely dry the doped polymer films. The entire processes of solution preparation, spin-coating, thermal annealing, and sequential solution doping were performed in a nitrogen-filled glove box.', '2.3 \x07Measurement of swelling ratio of polymer films', 'The swelling ratio of polymer films was calculated from the thicknesses of the polymer films before and after swelling in ACN. To swell the polymer films, pure ACN was poured into a glass petri dish, and the polymer films coated on Si substrates were immersed in the ACN for a minute. After being lifted from the ACN, the surface of polymer films was dried quickly by blowing with nitrogen gas to eliminate any residual solvent droplets. Then, the thicknesses of the polymer films were measured using ellipsometry (M-2000 ellipsometer, J.A.

P3HT thin films with different crystallinities were prepared to investigate the effect of polymer crystallinity on the dopant diffusion into polymer thin films during solution sequential doping. F4TCNQ, one of the most widely used molecular dopants for p-doping of conjugated polymers, was used in this study to dope the P3HT films via the sequential solution doping method. ACN was selected as the solvent for the dopant solution. ACN is a poor solvent for P3HT but dissolves F4TCNQ well, so it is widely used for sequential solution doping of P3HT films [21, 30, 32].', 'Thermal annealing of P3HT films at elevated temperatures is known to increase the crystallinity of the films [33]. To confirm the increased crystallinity of thermally annealed P3HT (P3HT-T) film compared to that of as-prepared P3HT (P3HT-A) film, two-dimensional (2D) GIXD measurements were performed (Fig. 1b and c). Figure 1b shows the 2D image of the diffraction pattern of P3HT-A and P3HT-T films, and Fig. 1c shows the corresponding one-dimensional diffraction intensity profiles along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. The diffraction patterns showed (h00) peaks and (010) peaks along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, indicating a bimodal orientation distribution (i.e., both edge-on and face-on orientations coexist) of P3HT crystallites. Compared to the P3HT-A film, the P3HT-T film showed much stronger (h00) peak intensities along the out-of-plane direction and (010) peak intensity along the in-plane direction. This result indicates that the P3HT-T film has greater crystallinity than the P3HT-A film, and that P3HT-T film has a greater portion of edge-on oriented crystallites among the bimodal orientation distribution compared to the P3HT-A film.', '@', '@', '3.2 \x07Spectroscopic characterizations on doped polymer films', 'To compare the doping behavior of P3HT-A and P3HT-T films during the sequential solution doping process, the polymer films were doped with the F4TCNQ dopant solution dissolved in ACN. The details of the sequential solution doping process can be found in the Experimental section.', 'FT-IR spectra of undoped and doped P3HT-A and P3HT-T films were measured to confirm the presence of dopant molecules within the doped polymer films (Fig. 2a). In both P3HT-A and P3HT-T, regardless of whether they were doped or not, the vibronic peaks at 2800–3000 \xadcm−1, which corresponded to C–H stretching of alkanes in their hexyl side chains [34], were commonly observed. The presence of F4TCNQ in the doped polymer films was evident from the  appearance of vibronic peaks at 2170 and 2189 \xadcm−1, which corresponded to C≡N stretching in F4TCNQ anions [27]. For reference, the C≡N-stretching peak of a neutral F4TCNQ molecule is known to appear at ~ 2230 \xadcm−1 [27]. When the absorption spectra of doped P3HT-A and doped P3HT-T films were normalized by the absorption maximum of the C–H-stretching peaks of each spectrum, the normalized absorption intensities of the C≡N-stretching peaks were nearly the same (Fig. 2b), suggesting nearly the same amount of F4TCNQ anions in the two films.', '@', '@', 'UV–Vis–NIR absorption spectra were obtained to assess the occurrence and extent of doping in P3HT-A and P3HT-T before and after sequential solution doping. The left and right panels of Fig. 2c represent the absorption spectra of P3HT-A and P3HT-T films, respectively, sequentially solution-doped with the dopant solutions at various dopant concentrations. Both P3HT-A and P3HT-T films showed similar changes in spectral shapes upon doping. In the undoped state, they showed an absorption band in the visible-wavelength range at around 300–650 nm, with a maximum absorption at 550 nm. The higher crystallinity of the P3HT-T film compared to that of the P3HT-A film could be confirmed again by the more pronounced absorption shoulder at ~ 600 nm in the P3HT-T film [33]. Upon doping the polymer films with F4TCNQ, a decrease in the initial absorption at around 500 nm and the emergence of a broad absorption peak between 1000 and 2000 nm were observed, due to the formation of positive polarons in P3HT [27, 35]. Additionally, distinct peaks at 413, 770, and 870 nm appeared in the spectra of doped polymer films, which are well known to be associated with the F4TCNQ anions formed by the electron transfer from P3HT to F4TCNQ upon doping [27]. The decrease in the initial absorption intensity and the increase of newly formed absorption peaks due to doping became more pronounced as the dopant concentration in solution increased, indicating a higher doping level of P3HT for the film doped with the dopant solution of greater concentration. When comparing the spectra of P3HT-A and P3HT-T films doped at the same dopant concentration, the intensities of P3HT positive polarons and F4TCNQ anions were slightly greater in P3HT-T than in P3HT-A; this was observed for all dopant concentrations tested. The greater polymer positive polaron and dopant anion intensities in P3HT-T than in P3HT-A, despite nearly the same dopant contents within them, suggested that the ionization of the dopant was slightly more efficient in the P3HT-T film than in the P3HT-A film, likely due to its greater degree of crystallinity and charge delocalization [36].', '3.3 \x07Effect of polymer crystallinity on the dopant distribution within polymer films', 'The effect of the polymer film’s crystallinity on the spatialdistribution of dopant molecules along the out-of-plane direction was investigated based on the structural analysis of the doped polymer films using 2D GIXD (Fig. 3). 2D GIXD measurements were performed at different X-ray incidence angles to compare the surface structure and the bulk structure of the doped P3HT films. At low incidence angles below the critical angle of the polymer film, the incident beam interacts with the polymer film at only a short distance below the film surface. In contrast, at high incidence angles above the critical angle of the polymer film, the incident beam penetrates the polymer film and interacts primarily with the bulk of the film. Therefore, comparing GIXD data obtained slightly below and above the critical angle is an effective way to assess the surface and bulk structures of the polymer films [37, 38].', 'Figure 3a shows the 2D images of GIXD patterns for doped P3HT-A and doped P3HT-T films obtained at low and high incidence angles. Figure 3b presents the one-dimensional intensity profiles along the out-of-plane direction derived from the 2D images in Fig. 3a. The profiles of undoped films are also shown in the plot for comparison. The (h00) and (010) diffraction peaks of P3HT crystals were observed in the doped films, similar to those in the undoped films. However, the peak positions shifted significantly upon doping; the (h00) peaks shifted toward smaller q values, while the (010) peak shifted toward larger q values. This trend is consistent with the previous reports [21, 28, 32], and such changes in crystal structure indicate that F4TCNQ molecules are incorporated within P3HT crystallites, especially in the lamellar regions between hexyl side chains of P3HT [28, 29]. In addition to the diffraction peaks of P3HT, the doped P3HT films also showed a new diffraction peak at q =  ~ 0.84 Å−1, which is assigned to the diffraction pattern that arises from F4TCNQ [27, 39].', 'Doped P3HT-A and P3HT-T films showed distinct X-ray incident angle dependence in their peak positions. While the doped P3HT-A film exhibited nearly the same (100) and (010) peak positions regardless of the incidence angle, the doped P3HT-T film displayed different (100) and (010) peak positions depending on the incidence angle. In the case of the doped P3HT-A, the (010) peak appeared at q = 1.691 and 1.689 Å−1 for high and low incidence angles, respectively, indicating virtually the same peak positions. The position of the (100) peak could not be quantified accurately due to its weak and broad nature. In contrast, in the case of the doped P3HT-T, the (010) peak appeared at q = 1.715 and 1.743 Å−1 for high and low incidence angles, respectively, while the (100) peak appeared at q = 0.341 and 0.333 Å−1 for high and low incidence angles, respectively. This suggests that the crystalline structure at the surface region of the doped P3HT-T film is quite different from that of the bulk region, with the surface region exhibiting more increased lamellar spacing and  more decreased π–π stacking distance compared to thoseof the film’s bulk. The changes in π–π stacking distanceand lamellar spacing are presented in Fig. 3c.', '@', '@', '@', 'Considering that the π–π stacking distance decreases more and the lamellar spacing increases more with respect to the increasing amount of dopant molecules incorporated into the P3HT crystals [32], the observed dependence of the diffraction peak position of doped P3HT-T on the X-ray incidence angle implies that the dopant concentration near the surface of doped P3HT-T is relatively greater than that in the bulk. On the other hand, the independence of the diffraction peak position of doped P3HT-A from the X-ray incidence angle indicates that there is no significant difference in the dopant concentration between the surface and the bulk regions of doped P3HT-A film.', 'It should be noted that, as confirmed earlier by the FT-IR spectroscopy results, the amount of dopant molecules present in the two polymer films is almost similar. Therefore, the above GIXD results do not arise from the difference in the absolute content of dopants within the two P3HT films, but rather from the different degrees of dopant diffusion from polymer surface toward the bulk, for the same overall of dopant contents within the films. That is, the diffusion of the dopant into the bulk of the film was less efficient in the more crystalline P3HT-T, resulting in a greater amount of dopant near the surface compared to the bulk.', '3.4 \x07Discussion on the origin of crystallinity‑dependent dopant distribution', 'It has been reported that the degree of swelling of a polymer thin film by solvents depends on the crystallinity of the polymer film; the higher the crystallinity of a conjugated polymer thin film, the lower the swelling ratio of the film, in general [40–43]. According to previous studies on the swelling of semicrystalline polymers, polymer crystallites are hardly penetrable to solvents, and thus, swelling occurs predominantly in the amorphous phase of the polymer films [42, 43]. Therefore, the trend of decreasing swelling ratio with respect to increasing polymer crystallinity can be understood as a result of the greater content of polymer crystallites within the film with higher crystallinity than that within the film with lower crystallinity. Based on this knowledge, we speculated that the swellability of P3HT thin films would change as a result of varied crystallinity of the films via thermal annealing; that is, the P3HT-T film would exhibit a smaller swelling ratio than the P3HT-A film when they reached swelling equilibrium with ACN due to its greater crystallinity. This speculation was shown to be valid by directly measuring the thickness of P3HT-A and P3HT-T films before and after swelling (Fig. 4). Film thicknesses were measured using an ellipsometer, fitting the recorded spectral data using the Cauchy model. In the fitting process,  only the wavelength region of 860–1000 nm was used to avoid the excitonic absorption peaks of the polymer films. In swelling the polymer films, pure ACN was used as the swelling agent, because it is the solvent of the F4TCNQ dopant solution used in our sequential solution doping process. The detailed procedure for swelling polymer films is provided in the Experimental section. After dipping the P3HT-A and P3HT-T polymer films in pure ACN for 5 min, the thickness of the films increased considerably compared to the initial (i.e., dried-state) thickness, indicating the uptake of ACN molecules in the polymer films. While the thicknesses of the dried P3HT-A and P3HT-T films are almost identical at ~ 47 nm, the thicknesses of the swelled films were significantly different, showing 53 (± 1.5) and 49 (± 0.2) nm for P3HT-A and P3HT-T, respectively (Fig. 4a). The corresponding percent increase in the film thickness was 11.3% for P3HT-A and 4.0% for P3HT-T (Fig. 4b). These results clearly show that the swellability of the P3HT films depends significantly on their crystallinities.', 'We expect that the crystallinity-dependent dopant distribution originates mainly from the different swellability of the polymer films. Swelling of polymer films by dopant solvent is known to be essential for the efficient diffusion of dopant molecules into polymer films during sequential solution doping process [20, 22, 43]. Previous studies have  reported that the more a polymer swells due to the dopant solvent, the easier the dopant diffusion can occur during sequential solution doping [20, 22]. Therefore, it is likely that the lower degree of swelling of P3HT-T compared to P3HT-A, due to its higher crystallinity, would lead to less-effective dopant diffusion into the bulk of the polymer film, resulting in the pronounced nonuniformity of the F4TCNQ distribution along the depth direction in doped P3HT-T film compared to that of doped P3HT-A film. The effect of polymer crystallinity on the dopant distribution of sequentially solution-doped polymer film is depicted schematically in Fig. 4c.', 'One might think that the different diffusion rates of dopants in the crystalline and amorphous regions of P3HT would also affect the dopant distribution in doped P3HT-A and P3HT-T films. Previous studies investigating the correlation between dopant diffusion and the ordering of conjugated polymers have demonstrated that dopant molecules tend to diffuse more slowly in disordered regions than in ordered regions of polythiophene-based conjugated polymer thin films [23, 44]. Based on this, if the different dopant distributions in P3HT-A and P3HT-T films originated from different diffusion rates of dopants in crystalline and amorphous regions, the dopant distribution should be more uniform along the depth direction in P3HT-T than  of dopant diffusion behavior into polymer films with differentcrystallinities and swellabilities. The consequent dopant distributionwithin each film is also demonstrated', '@', '@', 'in P3HT-A due to its higher crystallinity; however, our experimental observations indicate the opposite. Therefore, the observed dopant distribution cannot be explained based on different diffusion coefficients of dopants in crystalline and amorphous regions. Instead, it is more plausible that the different dopant distributions in P3HT-A and P3HT-T films are primarily attributed to their different degrees of swelling during the sequential solution doping process.', '4 \x07Conclusions', 'In summary, we investigated the effect of polymer crystallinity on the spatial distribution of dopants, especially along the direction perpendicular to the film surface, within sequentially solution-doped polymer films. The crystallinity of conjugated polymer films was controlled by thermal annealing, which resulted in greater crystallinity for the thermally annealed film compared to that of the as-prepared film. When the two films were sequentially doped with a dopant solution under the same conditions, they showed nearly the same dopant content over the entire film but had different dopant distributions along the depth direction; the film with greater crystallinity exhibited a more uneven distribution of the dopant compared to that with lower crystallinity, with a higher composition of the dopant at the surface than in the bulk. The difference in the dopant distributions was attributed to the different degree of swelling between the two films. That is, the film with higher crystallinity swelled less by the dopant solvent, which likely resulted in a relatively less efficient diffusion of the dopant from the surface into the bulk, leading to a higher concentration of dopant near the surface compared to the bulk. The findings of this study provide a deep understanding of how the structure of polymer films affects the diffusion behavior of dopants during the sequential solution doping process and are believed to offer insights into more efficient and systematic control of doping in conjugated polymer thin films.', 'Acknowledgements Y.

Since the spatial distribution of dopants in doped polymer films significantly influences their electrical properties, elucidating how various material parameters affect the dopant distribution in sequentially solution-doped polymer films is of great importance. This study investigates the effect of crystallinity in conjugated polymer thin films on the spatial distribution of dopants along the out-of-plane direction. The results show that higher crystallinity in polymer films leads to a more non-uniform dopant distribution, with a greater composition of dopants at the film surface compared to the bulk. This phenomenon is attributed to the crystallinity-dependent swellability of polymer films, where films with higher crystallinity exhibit lower swellability, resulting in less efficient dopant diffusion from the surface to the bulk compared to films with lower crystallinity.', 'Graphic abstract', 'This study explores how crystallinity in conjugated polymer thin films affects dopant distribution during sequential solution doping, revealing that higher crystallinity results in a more nonuniform distribution, with greater dopant compositions at the surface than in the bulk. This is due to lower swellability, which limits effective dopant diffusion from the surface to the bulk.', '@', 'Keywords Chemical doping · Conjugated polymers · Molecular dopants · Crystallinity · Sequential solution doping', '1 Introduction', 'Conjugated polymers have garnered significant attention in the field of organic electronics due to their unique optoelectronic properties [1–10]. One promising approach to enhance the performance of conjugated polymers is through doping, particularly in the field of polymer electrodes and organic thermoelectrics [3, 7, 11–16]. Doping involves introducing additional molecules into a polymer film to control the charge carrier concentration via charge transfer between them, resulting in changes to the polymer’s optical and electrical properties, such as electrical conductivity, Fermi level, and light absorption coefficients in visible and near-infrared ranges [17–19]. The development of efficient dopants and doping methods, along with a concrete understanding of the underlying principles, is essential for improving the performance of doped conjugated polymers in various applications.', 'Two commonly employed solution-based doping techniques used in the doping of conjugated polymers are mixed-solution doping and sequential solution doping. Mixed-solution doping of a conjugated polymer involves the blending of the polymer and dopant in one solution, followed by the deposition of the blend solution to obtain a doped polymer film [3]. Although this method is advantageous for the precise control of the ratio between the polymer and dopant, it often suffers from severe aggregation of charged polymers within the solution and poor quality of the resulting polymer films [20]. On the other hand, sequential solution doping of a conjugated polymer involves exposing a precast undoped polymer film to a dopant solution for an extended time, which then leads to the diffusion of dopant molecules into the polymer film [21]. This method allows for effective doping of polymer thin films without significantly damaging their microstructure, making it widely used for doping polymer thin films with optimized microstructures [18, 22].', 'Sequential solution doping, despite its advantages, presents some challenges. Since this doping method relies on the diffusion of dopant molecules within the already solidified polymer films, it may take a significant amount of time for the dopant molecules to penetrate deeply into the film [23, 24]. This means that for relatively thick polymer films, the dopant may not diffuse effectively throughout the entire film, resulting in considerable nonuniformity in dopant content and doping levels between the surface region and the bulk of the film. Non-uniform doping in thick polymer films can pose a serious drawback in the application of doped conjugated polymers. For example, in typical Π-structured thermoelectric devices based on conjugated polymers, a thick film is inevitably required to maximize the temperature difference across the device [25,  26]; however, the non-uniform doping in this thick film can lead to a significant deterioration of the thermoelectric performance of the device. In this context, understanding the distribution of dopant molecules within sequentially solution-doped polymer films and the factors influencing this distribution is crucial.', 'this distribution is crucial.Although many studies have revealed the spatial distribution of dopants within sequentially doped conjugated polymer films, they have primarily focused on where the dopants prefer to reside within the crystalline and amorphous regions of polymer films, or on how the inclusion of dopants affects the polymer’s crystalline structure [14–16, 27–30]. In contrast, the distribution of dopants along the thickness direction (i.e., along the out-of-plane direction) has received relatively little attention. A recent study demonstrated that doping of a conjugated polymer film using the immersion doping method leads to a significantly non-uniform dopant distribution along the thickness direction due to the limited diffusivity of dopants within the film [31]. While the study thoroughly examined the dopant diffusion process within a conjugated polymer film, it did not provide insights into how the film’s microstructure influences dopant diffusion behavior and spatial distribution. In this work, we investigate the effect of polymer crystallinity on the dopant distribution along the thickness direction of sequentially solution-doped conjugated polymer films. Using regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as a model conjugated polymer, we characterized the dopant distribution by varying the crystallinity of the polymer film via thermal annealing. Under the same conditions of sequential solution doping, it was found that while the overall dopant content within two polymer films with different degrees of crystallinity was almost similar, the distribution of dopants along the depth direction was different. The film with higher crystallinity exhibited greater nonuniformity in dopant distribution, with the ratio of dopant content between the film surface and bulk being higher in the film with greater crystallinity compared to the film with lower crystallinity. These differences are attributed to different swellabilities of the polymer films due to variations in their crystallinity, which affect the diffusion of dopant molecules within the films during the doping process.', '2 \x07Experimental', '2.1 \x07Materials', 'P3HT with regioregularity of ≥ 90% was purchased from Rieke Metals Inc.

Acetonitrile (ACN, ≥ 99.5%) and chloroform (CF,  anhydrous, ≥ 99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc.(Germany). The materials were used without any furtherpurification.', '2.2 \x07Preparation of polymer thin films and their sequential solution doping', 'Either soda-lime glass or a Si wafer with a native oxide was used as the substrates for sample preparation. The substrates were cleaned sequentially with detergent (Extran MA 02, Merck Millipore), deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. The substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 20 min before applying polymer solution on them. The polymer solution (5 mg \xadmL−1) was prepared by dissolving P3HT in CF at 55 °C. Then, the P3HT solution was spin-coated onto the substrates at 2000 rpm for 60 s. The resulting polymer films had a thickness of ~ 47 nm. For thermal annealing, P3HT films were placed on hot plates with a surface temperature of 200 °C for 10 min. For sequential solution doping, the dopant solution was prepared by dissolving F4TCNQ in ACN at room temperature. The concentration of the F4TCNQ dopant solution varied from 0.15 to 2.0 wt%. Doping was performed by dropping the dopant solution onto the polymer film to cover the entire surface and maintaining it for a minute to allow diffusion of dopant molecules into the polymer film. Then, the residual dopant solution was removed by spin-coating. After the doping process, doped polymer films were thermally annealed for 5 min at a mild temperature of 85 °C, which is slightly above the boiling temperature of ACN, to completely dry the doped polymer films. The entire processes of solution preparation, spin-coating, thermal annealing, and sequential solution doping were performed in a nitrogen-filled glove box.', '2.3 \x07Measurement of swelling ratio of polymer films', 'The swelling ratio of polymer films was calculated from the thicknesses of the polymer films before and after swelling in ACN. To swell the polymer films, pure ACN was poured into a glass petri dish, and the polymer films coated on Si substrates were immersed in the ACN for a minute. After being lifted from the ACN, the surface of polymer films was dried quickly by blowing with nitrogen gas to eliminate any residual solvent droplets. Then, the thicknesses of the polymer films were measured using ellipsometry (M-2000 ellipsometer, J.A. Woollam), using the Cauchy model to fit the recorded spectra in the 860–1000 nm wavelength range.

To compare the surface structure and the bulk structure of the polymer films, the GIXD data were recorded by varying the incidence angle by 0.5° above and below the critical angle. Ultraviolet–visible–near-infrared (UV–Vis–NIR) absorption spectra were obtained using a V-770 spectrometer (Jasco). Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained using a VERTEX 70v FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker).', '3 \x07Results and discussion', '3.1 \x07Conjugated polymer thin films with different crystallinities', 'In this study, regioregular P3HT was chosen as a model conjugated polymer (Fig. 1a). P3HT thin films with different crystallinities were prepared to investigate the effect of polymer crystallinity on the dopant diffusion into polymer thin films during solution sequential doping. F4TCNQ, one of the most widely used molecular dopants for p-doping of conjugated polymers, was used in this study to dope the P3HT films via the sequential solution doping method. ACN was selected as the solvent for the dopant solution. ACN is a poor solvent for P3HT but dissolves F4TCNQ well, so it is widely used for sequential solution doping of P3HT films [21, 30, 32].', 'Thermal annealing of P3HT films at elevated temperatures is known to increase the crystallinity of the films [33]. To confirm the increased crystallinity of thermally annealed P3HT (P3HT-T) film compared to that of as-prepared P3HT (P3HT-A) film, two-dimensional (2D) GIXD measurements were performed (Fig. 1b and c). Figure 1b shows the 2D image of the diffraction pattern of P3HT-A and P3HT-T films, and Fig. 1c shows the corresponding one-dimensional diffraction intensity profiles along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. The diffraction patterns showed (h00) peaks and (010) peaks along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, indicating a bimodal orientation distribution (i.e., both edge-on and face-on orientations coexist) of P3HT crystallites. Compared to the P3HT-A film, the P3HT-T film showed much stronger (h00) peak intensities along the out-of-plane direction and (010) peak intensity along the in-plane direction. This result indicates that the P3HT-T film has greater crystallinity than the P3HT-A film, and that P3HT-T film has a greater portion of edge-on oriented crystallites among the bimodal orientation distribution compared to the P3HT-A film.', '@', '@', '3.2 \x07Spectroscopic characterizations on doped polymer films', 'To compare the doping behavior of P3HT-A and P3HT-T films during the sequential solution doping process, the polymer films were doped with the F4TCNQ dopant solution dissolved in ACN. The details of the sequential solution doping process can be found in the Experimental section.', 'FT-IR spectra of undoped and doped P3HT-A and P3HT-T films were measured to confirm the presence of dopant molecules within the doped polymer films (Fig. 2a). In both P3HT-A and P3HT-T, regardless of whether they were doped or not, the vibronic peaks at 2800–3000 \xadcm−1, which corresponded to C–H stretching of alkanes in their hexyl side chains [34], were commonly observed. The presence of F4TCNQ in the doped polymer films was evident from the  appearance of vibronic peaks at 2170 and 2189 \xadcm−1, which corresponded to C≡N stretching in F4TCNQ anions [27]. For reference, the C≡N-stretching peak of a neutral F4TCNQ molecule is known to appear at ~ 2230 \xadcm−1 [27]. When the absorption spectra of doped P3HT-A and doped P3HT-T films were normalized by the absorption maximum of the C–H-stretching peaks of each spectrum, the normalized absorption intensities of the C≡N-stretching peaks were nearly the same (Fig. 2b), suggesting nearly the same amount of F4TCNQ anions in the two films.', '@', '@', 'UV–Vis–NIR absorption spectra were obtained to assess the occurrence and extent of doping in P3HT-A and P3HT-T before and after sequential solution doping. The left and right panels of Fig. 2c represent the absorption spectra of P3HT-A and P3HT-T films, respectively, sequentially solution-doped with the dopant solutions at various dopant concentrations. Both P3HT-A and P3HT-T films showed similar changes in spectral shapes upon doping. In the undoped state, they showed an absorption band in the visible-wavelength range at around 300–650 nm, with a maximum absorption at 550 nm. The higher crystallinity of the P3HT-T film compared to that of the P3HT-A film could be confirmed again by the more pronounced absorption shoulder at ~ 600 nm in the P3HT-T film [33]. Upon doping the polymer films with F4TCNQ, a decrease in the initial absorption at around 500 nm and the emergence of a broad absorption peak between 1000 and 2000 nm were observed, due to the formation of positive polarons in P3HT [27, 35]. Additionally, distinct peaks at 413, 770, and 870 nm appeared in the spectra of doped polymer films, which are well known to be associated with the F4TCNQ anions formed by the electron transfer from P3HT to F4TCNQ upon doping [27]. The decrease in the initial absorption intensity and the increase of newly formed absorption peaks due to doping became more pronounced as the dopant concentration in solution increased, indicating a higher doping level of P3HT for the film doped with the dopant solution of greater concentration. When comparing the spectra of P3HT-A and P3HT-T films doped at the same dopant concentration, the intensities of P3HT positive polarons and F4TCNQ anions were slightly greater in P3HT-T than in P3HT-A; this was observed for all dopant concentrations tested. The greater polymer positive polaron and dopant anion intensities in P3HT-T than in P3HT-A, despite nearly the same dopant contents within them, suggested that the ionization of the dopant was slightly more efficient in the P3HT-T film than in the P3HT-A film, likely due to its greater degree of crystallinity and charge delocalization [36].', '3.3 \x07Effect of polymer crystallinity on the dopant distribution within polymer films', 'The effect of the polymer film’s crystallinity on the spatialdistribution of dopant molecules along the out-of-plane direction was investigated based on the structural analysis of the doped polymer films using 2D GIXD (Fig. 3). 2D GIXD measurements were performed at different X-ray incidence angles to compare the surface structure and the bulk structure of the doped P3HT films. At low incidence angles below the critical angle of the polymer film, the incident beam interacts with the polymer film at only a short distance below the film surface. In contrast, at high incidence angles above the critical angle of the polymer film, the incident beam penetrates the polymer film and interacts primarily with the bulk of the film. Therefore, comparing GIXD data obtained slightly below and above the critical angle is an effective way to assess the surface and bulk structures of the polymer films [37, 38].', 'Figure 3a shows the 2D images of GIXD patterns for doped P3HT-A and doped P3HT-T films obtained at low and high incidence angles. Figure 3b presents the one-dimensional intensity profiles along the out-of-plane direction derived from the 2D images in Fig. 3a. The profiles of undoped films are also shown in the plot for comparison. The (h00) and (010) diffraction peaks of P3HT crystals were observed in the doped films, similar to those in the undoped films. However, the peak positions shifted significantly upon doping; the (h00) peaks shifted toward smaller q values, while the (010) peak shifted toward larger q values. This trend is consistent with the previous reports [21, 28, 32], and such changes in crystal structure indicate that F4TCNQ molecules are incorporated within P3HT crystallites, especially in the lamellar regions between hexyl side chains of P3HT [28, 29]. In addition to the diffraction peaks of P3HT, the doped P3HT films also showed a new diffraction peak at q =  ~ 0.84 Å−1, which is assigned to the diffraction pattern that arises from F4TCNQ [27, 39].', 'Doped P3HT-A and P3HT-T films showed distinct X-ray incident angle dependence in their peak positions. While the doped P3HT-A film exhibited nearly the same (100) and (010) peak positions regardless of the incidence angle, the doped P3HT-T film displayed different (100) and (010) peak positions depending on the incidence angle. In the case of the doped P3HT-A, the (010) peak appeared at q = 1.691 and 1.689 Å−1 for high and low incidence angles, respectively, indicating virtually the same peak positions. The position of the (100) peak could not be quantified accurately due to its weak and broad nature. In contrast, in the case of the doped P3HT-T, the (010) peak appeared at q = 1.715 and 1.743 Å−1 for high and low incidence angles, respectively, while the (100) peak appeared at q = 0.341 and 0.333 Å−1 for high and low incidence angles, respectively. This suggests that the crystalline structure at the surface region of the doped P3HT-T film is quite different from that of the bulk region, with the surface region exhibiting more increased lamellar spacing and  more decreased π–π stacking distance compared to thoseof the film’s bulk. The changes in π–π stacking distanceand lamellar spacing are presented in Fig. 3c.', '@', '@', '@', 'Considering that the π–π stacking distance decreases more and the lamellar spacing increases more with respect to the increasing amount of dopant molecules incorporated into the P3HT crystals [32], the observed dependence of the diffraction peak position of doped P3HT-T on the X-ray incidence angle implies that the dopant concentration near the surface of doped P3HT-T is relatively greater than that in the bulk. On the other hand, the independence of the diffraction peak position of doped P3HT-A from the X-ray incidence angle indicates that there is no significant difference in the dopant concentration between the surface and the bulk regions of doped P3HT-A film.', 'It should be noted that, as confirmed earlier by the FT-IR spectroscopy results, the amount of dopant molecules present in the two polymer films is almost similar. Therefore, the above GIXD results do not arise from the difference in the absolute content of dopants within the two P3HT films, but rather from the different degrees of dopant diffusion from polymer surface toward the bulk, for the same overall of dopant contents within the films. That is, the diffusion of the dopant into the bulk of the film was less efficient in the more crystalline P3HT-T, resulting in a greater amount of dopant near the surface compared to the bulk.', '3.4 \x07Discussion on the origin of crystallinity‑dependent dopant distribution', 'It has been reported that the degree of swelling of a polymer thin film by solvents depends on the crystallinity of the polymer film; the higher the crystallinity of a conjugated polymer thin film, the lower the swelling ratio of the film, in general [40–43]. According to previous studies on the swelling of semicrystalline polymers, polymer crystallites are hardly penetrable to solvents, and thus, swelling occurs predominantly in the amorphous phase of the polymer films [42, 43]. Therefore, the trend of decreasing swelling ratio with respect to increasing polymer crystallinity can be understood as a result of the greater content of polymer crystallites within the film with higher crystallinity than that within the film with lower crystallinity. Based on this knowledge, we speculated that the swellability of P3HT thin films would change as a result of varied crystallinity of the films via thermal annealing; that is, the P3HT-T film would exhibit a smaller swelling ratio than the P3HT-A film when they reached swelling equilibrium with ACN due to its greater crystallinity. This speculation was shown to be valid by directly measuring the thickness of P3HT-A and P3HT-T films before and after swelling (Fig. 4). Film thicknesses were measured using an ellipsometer, fitting the recorded spectral data using the Cauchy model. In the fitting process,  only the wavelength region of 860–1000 nm was used to avoid the excitonic absorption peaks of the polymer films. In swelling the polymer films, pure ACN was used as the swelling agent, because it is the solvent of the F4TCNQ dopant solution used in our sequential solution doping process. The detailed procedure for swelling polymer films is provided in the Experimental section. After dipping the P3HT-A and P3HT-T polymer films in pure ACN for 5 min, the thickness of the films increased considerably compared to the initial (i.e., dried-state) thickness, indicating the uptake of ACN molecules in the polymer films. While the thicknesses of the dried P3HT-A and P3HT-T films are almost identical at ~ 47 nm, the thicknesses of the swelled films were significantly different, showing 53 (± 1.5) and 49 (± 0.2) nm for P3HT-A and P3HT-T, respectively (Fig. 4a). The corresponding percent increase in the film thickness was 11.3% for P3HT-A and 4.0% for P3HT-T (Fig. 4b). These results clearly show that the swellability of the P3HT films depends significantly on their crystallinities.', 'We expect that the crystallinity-dependent dopant distribution originates mainly from the different swellability of the polymer films. Swelling of polymer films by dopant solvent is known to be essential for the efficient diffusion of dopant molecules into polymer films during sequential solution doping process [20, 22, 43]. Previous studies have  reported that the more a polymer swells due to the dopant solvent, the easier the dopant diffusion can occur during sequential solution doping [20, 22]. Therefore, it is likely that the lower degree of swelling of P3HT-T compared to P3HT-A, due to its higher crystallinity, would lead to less-effective dopant diffusion into the bulk of the polymer film, resulting in the pronounced nonuniformity of the F4TCNQ distribution along the depth direction in doped P3HT-T film compared to that of doped P3HT-A film. The effect of polymer crystallinity on the dopant distribution of sequentially solution-doped polymer film is depicted schematically in Fig. 4c.', 'One might think that the different diffusion rates of dopants in the crystalline and amorphous regions of P3HT would also affect the dopant distribution in doped P3HT-A and P3HT-T films. Previous studies investigating the correlation between dopant diffusion and the ordering of conjugated polymers have demonstrated that dopant molecules tend to diffuse more slowly in disordered regions than in ordered regions of polythiophene-based conjugated polymer thin films [23, 44]. Based on this, if the different dopant distributions in P3HT-A and P3HT-T films originated from different diffusion rates of dopants in crystalline and amorphous regions, the dopant distribution should be more uniform along the depth direction in P3HT-T than  of dopant diffusion behavior into polymer films with differentcrystallinities and swellabilities. The consequent dopant distributionwithin each film is also demonstrated', '@', '@', 'in P3HT-A due to its higher crystallinity; however, our experimental observations indicate the opposite. Therefore, the observed dopant distribution cannot be explained based on different diffusion coefficients of dopants in crystalline and amorphous regions. Instead, it is more plausible that the different dopant distributions in P3HT-A and P3HT-T films are primarily attributed to their different degrees of swelling during the sequential solution doping process.', '4 \x07Conclusions', 'In summary, we investigated the effect of polymer crystallinity on the spatial distribution of dopants, especially along the direction perpendicular to the film surface, within sequentially solution-doped polymer films. The crystallinity of conjugated polymer films was controlled by thermal annealing, which resulted in greater crystallinity for the thermally annealed film compared to that of the as-prepared film. When the two films were sequentially doped with a dopant solution under the same conditions, they showed nearly the same dopant content over the entire film but had different dopant distributions along the depth direction; the film with greater crystallinity exhibited a more uneven distribution of the dopant compared to that with lower crystallinity, with a higher composition of the dopant at the surface than in the bulk. The difference in the dopant distributions was attributed to the different degree of swelling between the two films. That is, the film with higher crystallinity swelled less by the dopant solvent, which likely resulted in a relatively less efficient diffusion of the dopant from the surface into the bulk, leading to a higher concentration of dopant near the surface compared to the bulk. The findings of this study provide a deep understanding of how the structure of polymer films affects the diffusion behavior of dopants during the sequential solution doping process and are believed to offer insights into more efficient and systematic control of doping in conjugated polymer thin films.', 'Acknowledgements Y.
