Moreover, the dilution condition should be applied to suppress the concurrent chain extension. In consequence, this bimolecular process is nowrecognized as a less attractive choice for the preparation of cyclic polymers in practice (Scheme 1A).', '@', '@', 'A significantly improved means by an alternative unimolecular process has subsequently been introduced to prepare cyclic polymers (Scheme 1B). It was first demonstrated by using an asymmetrically functional telechelic precursor, a-acetal-u-styryl polystyrene,7 and the subsequent end-to-end polymer cyclization through the deprotection/activation treatment. This unimolecular process with asymmetrically functional telechelic precursors has been extended by employing alternative pairs of the reactive groups. Thus, an a-amino-u-carboxyl polystyrene and poly(tert-butyl acrylate) were prepared through a living polymerization using an initiator having a protected amino group, followed by the end-capping reaction to introduce a carboxylic group.8 The resulting asymmetric telechelic precursor underwent, after the deprotection, an intramolecular amidation reaction to give a ring polymer product effectively. Alternatively, an a-(furan-pro-tected)-maleimide-u-cyclopentadienylpoly(methylmethacry-late) and poly(tert-butyl acrylate) were prepared through the ATRP using a protected maleimide initiator and the subsequent introduction of a cyclopentadienyl group at the living end with the nickelocene methodology.9 The obtained asymmetric tele-chelic precursor was subjected to the heat treatment to cause the spontaneous deprotection followed by an intramolecular Diels–Alder addition reaction to give a ring polymer product effectively.9 It is notable, however, that these processes using telechelic precursors having potentially reactive groups require multistep protection/deprotection treatments.', 'A versatile unimolecular process has recently been introduced by employing a click reaction using asymmetrically functional telechelic polystyrene having an alkyne and an azide group.10 The introduction of these two functional groups at the polymer chain-ends could be performed conveniently, and they can react with each other upon the addition of a Cu catalyst.11 Therefore, this click polymer cyclization has been applied to prepare such functional ring polymers, as poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide)12,13and poly(caprolactone)14 as well as poly(valerolactone)15 to elucidate their topology-effect on phase transition, and on biodegradation, respectively, detailed in the later section. This unimolecular click process has also been employed to construct complex cyclic structures, either having multiple polymer segment components16 or having multicyclic as well as cyclic/ linear hybrid polymer segments.17 On the other hand, the bimo-lecular click process using an azide-ended bifunctional telechelic precursor and a bifunctional alkyne compound as a linking reagentproceedslesseffectivelythantheunimolecular counterpart.18', 'Another effective unimolecular process has been developed using symmetrically functional telechelic precursors, which are readily obtainable through a direct end-capping reaction of living bifunctional polymers (Scheme 1C).18–23 Thus, telechelic poly(tetrahydrofuran), poly(acrylic ester) and poly(isobutene) having olefinic end groups were prepared through the relevant living polymerization followed by the end-capping reaction. The subsequent metathesis condensation, i.e., metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC), in the presence of a Grubbs catalyst pro-ceeded effectively to give the corresponding ring polymers in high yields even under dilution.18–20 This MPC process has further been applied for the practical synthesis of amphiphilic cyclicblock copolymers21 as well as of multi-cyclic polymers.22,23 This unimolecular process using symmetrically functional telechelic precursors has been extended by alternative telechelic precursors having either alkyne groups for Glaser condensation or having bromobenzyl groups for a radical coupling process.24,25', 'Ring polymers are obtainable alternatively through a direct ring-expansion polymerization, in which the successive insertion of monomers into a cyclic initiator proceeds to form a ring polymer structure (Scheme 1D). This process does not require dilution in contrast to the end-to-end polymer cyclization process by linear polymer precursors, while a reactive initiator fragment is inherently included in the final ring polymer structure. Thus until recently, the ring-expansion process has been considered as a less practical means, since it is not an easy task to maintain the ring topology of the product while eliminating the initiator residues.26', 'A number of new processes have recently been developed to address this problem in the ring-expansion polymerization (Scheme 2). Thus, a new Ru catalyst bearing a cyclic ligand containing the Ru-alkylidene unit has been introduced and applied for the ring-expansion polymerization of cyclic olefins such as 1,5-cyclooctadiene or cyclooctene.27 During the chain-growth process, the chain transfer to the Ru-alkylidene unit took place to eliminate the initiator complex, and consequently a ring polybutadiene or a ring poly(cyclooctene) free of the catalyst fragment, respectively, is produced. The obtained ring poly(cyclooctene)wasthenhydrogenatedtogivearing polyethylene, showing distinctive properties in comparison with commercial linear polyethylenes (Scheme 2A).27,28 It is notable,at the same time, that the random nature of this chain transfer process inherently causes the broadening of the molecular weight distribution of the product. This process has now been applied with a bulky, dendronized monomer to construct a ring nano-object directly observable by atomic force microscopy (AFM).29', 'More recently, a new N-heterocyclic carbene initiator was introduced for the ring-expansion polymerization of lactones or lactide to form ring polyesters or polylactide, respectively (Scheme 2B).30,31 Remarkably, the obtained ring polymers possess narrow molecular weight distributions through the elimination of the initiator fragment after the quantitative consumption of the monomer, in contrast to the metathesis ring-expansion process shown before.28 By exploiting the living character, this technique has subsequently been applied for the synthesis of ring block polypeptoids and of complex topological polymers having a ring with many branches, i.e., jellyfish poly-mers.32,33 A further development of the ring-expansion process would provide a wider variety of chemical structures in ring polymers by broadening the choice of monomer types.', 'The combination of the classical ring-expansion polymeriza-tion process, in which the initiator fragment is included within the ring polymer structure, with the end-to-end polymer cycli-zation process could provide a new effective means for ring polymers having, in particular, large sizes (Scheme 2C).34 Thus, a ring poly(caprolactone) having short photocrosslinkable block segments was prepared through a sequential living ring-expan-sion polymerization using a cyclic stannate initiator. The subsequent irradiation under dilution caused the intramolecular covalent linking of the two short segments. The subsequentremoval of the stannate group produced a chemically stable ring polymer product, though the exact chemical structure of the linking units is obscure.34', '@', '@', 'By employing this methodology, a high-molecular weight ring poly(chloroethyl vinyl ether) was prepared and was subjected to the grafting-onto reaction using a living polystyrene, to form a densely grafted large ring polymer product as a nanoobject, which was directly observable by the AFM.35,36 On the other hand, the AFM showed a large fraction of uncyclized, linear polymer components remained in the crude cyclization products, revealing the inherent difficulty of the end-to-end cyclization of polymer precursors of high molecular weights. It is remarkable, moreover, that a small portion of nanoobjects corresponding to complex ring polymers having tadpole, 8-shaped, catenated and knotted forms were also identified. This showed, for the first time, that not only single-cyclic but also various complex cyclic polymer topologies are indeed produced through the polymer cyclization process, as previously shown in DNA systems.37', 'An electrostatic self-assembly and covalent fixation (ESA-CF) process has been introduced for the effective synthesis of not only cyclic but also functionalized cyclic and multicyclic polymers, where linear or star telechelic polymers having cyclic ammonium salt groups accompanying small or polymeric plurifunctional carboxylate counteranions are employed as key precursors (Scheme 1E).38–40 Various telechelic polymers have been conve-niently prepared through the relevant living polymerization fol-lowed by the end-capping/end-conversion technique. The choice of such particular types of cyclic ammonium salt end groups as five- and six-membered cyclic ammonium, i.e., N-phenyl-pyrrolidinium and N-phenylpiperidinium salt groups, respec-tively, is of a crucial importance in the ESA-CF process (Scheme 3).41 The former undergoes upon heating a selective ring-opening reaction by a carboxylate counteranion to form an amino ester group through the nucleophilic attack exclusively at the N-adjacent ring (endo) position. On the other hand, the latter having unstrained six-membered cyclic ammonium salt groups gives a chemically more stable, simple ester group through the nucleophilic attack at the alternative N-adjacent (exo) position, to eliminate N-phenylpiperidine.', 'And in the electrostatic polymer self-assembly, the cations at the end of the telechelics and the anions in the carboxylates counteranions always balance the charges. Upon the dilution, the self-assembly tends to dissociate into one having the smallest number of polymer components by keeping the balance of the charges (Scheme 4). Thus, when a self-assembly comprised ofa linear telechelic precursor, typically poly(THF), having cyclic ammonium salt groups accompanying either a dicarboxylate or a tetracarboxylate counteranion was heated at dilution, the selective ring-opening reaction of the cyclic ammonium groups took place to produce single-cyclic (ring) or dicyclic (8-shaped) polymerproducts,respectively,inhighyields.38,42Ring poly(THF)s having the molecular weights of up to 10 000, cor-responding to the ring size of as high as 700 atoms, were obtainable and characterized unequivocally by the MALDI-TOF mass technique. Furthermore, the ESA-CF process with dynamic equilibrium nature has been exploited to construct various multicyclic as well as cyclic-linear hybrid polymer topologies (Scheme 5).6', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Moreover, ring polymers possessing the prescribed functional groups at the designated positions, i.e., kyklo-telechelics and cyclic macromonomer, have also been prepared by employing telechelic precursors possessing such functional groups as hydroxyl, olefinic, acetylenic, and azide groups at the designated, typically a center, position by using the relevant initiator, or by introducing functional linking reagents.43 They were subse-quently applied to construct more complex polymer topologies either through the covalent linkage or even through the non-covalent, mechanical linkage uniquely formed by threading with ring polymer units.44,45 It was also shown that network polymers formed from cyclic polymer precursors exhibited unique gel properties compared with conventional gels obtained with linear/ branched polymer precursors.46 Moreover, the topological conversion of polymers between ring/linear and even between single-cyclic/dicyclic topologies has now been achieved.45,47,48', 'By the combination of the ESA-CF protocol with selective covalent linking chemistry, a wide variety of multi-cyclic as well as cyclic-linear conjugated polymers have been synthesized.49 In particular, the combination of the ESA-CF process with the metathesis condensation and with the click process has now been revealed as a versatile means to construct a variety of complex multicyclic polymer topologies of fused-, spiro- and bridged forms (Scheme 6).50 Both the functional ring polymer precursors and thecovalentlylinkedmulticyclicpolymerproductwere unequivocally characterized by means of a series of spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques including MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy and SEC. As shown in Fig. 1, for a typical example, the structure of the polymer products having complex multicyclic topologies is convincingly demonstrated. The ESA-CF process has further been applied for the effective synthesis of topologi-cally unique polymer catenanes comprised of large polymerrings51 through the two orthogonal non-covalent interactions, namely the electrostatic and the hydrogen-bond interactions (Scheme 5).45', '@', '@', '3.Topology effects by cyclic polymers: depleting the chain-ends and beyond', 'In contrast to linear or branched polymer topologies, ring polymer topologies are uniquely defined by their absence of the chain ends.3,5 As recognized by the typical case of glass transition temperature (Tg), the topology effect of ring polymers is thus arisen from the depletion of the end-groups of polymer segments. Thus, the Tg of ring polymers is higher than the linear counter-part, until the polymer chain length becomes long enough to diminish the contribution of the chain end. On the contrary, the hydrodynamic volume or the melt viscosity of ring polymers is inherently smaller than their linear counterparts irrespective of their chain lengths. This indicates the distinctive conception in the topology effect by ring polymers. The latter is regarded as an inherent topology effect by ring polymers, while the former as the depletion effect of the polymer chain ends. Nevertheless, the elimination of the chain ends of polymer molecules inevitably leads to the formation of cyclic constructions to bring the topology effect, now drawing increasing interests to discover unusual properties and functions in polymer materials covering mechanical, thermal, electric, photonic and bio-related applica-tions either in bulk or at surface. From an experimental point ofview, moreover, further developments are awaited to provide ring polymers possessing high molecular weights with guaran-teed purity, since the mixing of even small amount of linear counterpartmightcauseinconclusiveorevenerroneous conclusions on the topology effect by ring polymers.', '4.Topology effects on basic polymer properties: simulations and experiments from simple to complex cyclic polymers', 'Basic characteristics of single-cyclic (ring) homopolymers either in solution or bulk, in static or dynamic states, have extensively been studied and documented relevantly.3 Therefore, recent studies have elaborated either on specific polymers of practical importance like polyethylenes,52 on specific chain characteristics like semiflexible to stiff nature,53 or on multicomponent polymer systemstypicallyblockcopolymers.54Notably,moreover, theory and simulation studies have increasingly focused on multi-cyclic complex polymers, obviously promoted by synthetic developments on complex topological polymers.55–57 Unique topological polymer properties envisaged by the simulation studies are now to be verified experimentally using relevant topological polymers. Indeed, a collaborative simulation and experimental study on the liquid chromatography study has been conducted on multi-cyclic polymers, and could provide a basis for the purification and the characterization of polymers having complex topologies.58', '@', '@', 'The diffusion behavior is of particular interest in view of the topology effects on polymer molecules, since the self-diffusion of linear and branched polymers follows the reptation mechanism, a snake-like translational motion, in which the polymer chain ends tend to command the motion of their in-chain segments.59Cyclic polymers are unique, on the other hand, in the absence of chain ends, and their non-reptation dynamics has been a subject of both theory/simulation and experimental studies.60', 'A single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy is a unique means to observe directlythe motion of single polymer molecules.61 Thus, the ESA-CF process was applied with mono- and bifunctional telechelic poly(THF) precursors having N-phenylpiperidinium (six-membered ring) groups possessing a perylene dicarboxylate counteranion, to produce ring and linear poly(THF)s having a perylene unit applicable to the single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy measurement (Scheme 7).62', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The subsequent single-molecule imaging was conducted to observe the real-time motion of individual polymer molecules. The video-recording of the motion of single-molecule fluores-cence images, followed by the computational analysis couldprovide the position and trajectory of the object on the x–y plane as shown in Fig. 2. The histograms of the distribution of the individual diffusion constant were subsequently obtained from large enough datasets of these consecutive images. Upon the statistical analysis of the distribution patterns, a bimodal diffu-sion mechanism was disclosed for ring polymers, corresponding to either threaded or non-threaded conditions in a linear mole-cule matrix. In contrast, the unimodal diffusion was indicated for the linear counterpart (Fig. 3).', 'As shown above, the significant topology effects could be envisaged in polymer properties involving their diffusion process. In this respect, the crystallization dynamics is of a considerable interest since the diffusion and the conformational trans-formation of polymer molecules could dictate the folding andpacking of polymer segments in the crystal lattice. To elucidate the topology effect in the crystallization process, a defect-free ring poly(THF) was prepared together with the linear counterpart having the precisely relevant chemical structure.63 Thus, a living bifunctional poly(THF) was terminated with sodium allyloxide to give a telechelic precursor having allyl end groups. The subsequent metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC) with a Grubbs catalyst under dilution, followed by the hydrogenation of the unsaturated linking group afforded a defect-free ring poly(THF), consisting exclusively of oxytetramethylene units (Scheme 8). The isothermal crystallization experiments showed the slower crystallization rate for ring poly(THF)s ascribed to their topologically constrained conformation (Fig. 4). Moreover,', '@', '@', '@', '@distinctive crystal morphologies are produced, in particular a banded structure in the spherulites exclusively for the ring poly (THF) but not for the linear counterpart. The crystallization kinetics of ring poly(3-caprolactone)s has recently been reported by several groups.64 The faster crystallization rate was observed for ring polymers than the linear counterpart in contrast to the case of poly(THF), and was ascribed to the higher diffusion of ring polymers than their linear counterparts.64', '@', '@', '@', '@', '5.Topology effects by ring polymers in self-assemblies', 'The topology effects by ring polymers could be amplified in their assembled states rather than in their individually separated forms. Therefore, micelles formed by ring polymers should be of a remarkable interest. Thus, a series of micelles were prepared with amphiphilic cyclic AB block copolymers, comprised of eitherpoly(butyleneoxide)/poly(ethyleneoxide)orpoly (propylene oxide)/poly(ethylene oxide), together with their linear AB, linear ABA block copolymer counterparts.65–67 The cyclic block copolymer employed in this study was prepared by a bimolecular process using the hydroxy-terminated linear block copolymer and dichloromethane as a linking reagent in the presence of KOH, to form an acetal linking unit (Scheme 9A).', 'The critical micelle concentration (cmc) of the micelle with the cyclic AB block copolymer was similar to or marginally smaller than those with the linear ABA counterparts. On the contrary, the corresponding micelle with the linear AB counterpart showed a significantly smaller cmc. Moreover, the association number(Nw), thermodynamic radius (rt), and hydrodynamic radius (rh) of the micelle with the cyclic AB block copolymers and with the linear ABA counterparts were comparable to each other, but distinctively smaller than those with the linear AB counterparts. These results are consistent with the geometric estimation of the size of the micelles, corresponding to the Nw, rt, and rh, which is dependent on the continuous chain length of the hydrophobic segment in the block copolymers. And, those in the cyclic AB and the linear ABA block copolymers are estimated as a half of that in the linear AB counterpart employed in this study. Moreover, the cyclic AB block copolymer tends to constitute a stiff hairpin-like conformation, resulting in a slightly larger hydrophobic core within the micelle compared to that with the linear ABA coun-terpart having free chain ends. The enthalpy of micellization (DmicH�) was also smaller with the cyclic AB block copolymer than that with the corresponding linear ABA counterpart, presumably because the segmental flip-flop is inhibited in the micelle with the former, in contrast to the motional freedom by the latter having free chain ends. This also agrees with the smaller entropy of micellization (DmicS�) with the cyclic AB block copolymer than with the linear counterpart.', '@', '@', 'More recently, a significant topology effect has been revealed in the thermal stability of the micelle formed with cyclic AB block copolymers in comparison with the linear ABA and even with the linear AB counterparts.68 Notably, a variety of relevant cyclic lipids, thus a type of surfactants, have been discovered in the cell membrane of thermophilic archaea, single-cell microorganisms, surviving in the hostile environment of very high-temperatures located at hot springs and submarine volcanoes.69 Thus, an amphiphilic cyclic AB block copolymer, comprised of poly(butyl acrylate)/poly(ethylene oxide) segments, was prepared. The unimolecular, metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC) process was employed using a linear ABA block copolymer precursor having olefinic end groups (Scheme 9B).21', 'The obtained cyclic and the relevant linear block copolymers were allowed to form the corresponding micelles, in which their cmc’s and the number-average hydrodynamic volumes (Dh) were measured to be closely comparable to each other (Fig. 5).68 The size and morphology of the micelles with either block copolymers were directly observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 6) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 6) to show commonly flower-like spherical shapes possessing the consistent diameters determined by DLS (Scheme 10).', 'Remarkably, the thermal stability of the micelles was drasti-cally enhanced using the cyclic block copolymer. Thus, thecorresponding micelle solutions were heated from 20�C in a stepwise fashion (Fig. 7), and the micelle with the linear ABA block copolymer became turbid at around 25 �C, while that with the cyclic AB counterpart was stable till above 70 �C.68', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Based on the large deviation of the clouding point (Tc) among the micelles either solely with cyclic or with linear block copol-ymers, the tuning of the Tc of the micelle was achieved by the coassembly of both the linear and cyclic block copolymers.68Thus, the Tc was systematically altered along with the relative contents of the cyclic and the linear block copolymer compo-nents in the micelle, as shown in Fig. 7.68 This topology effect will be utilized to design temperature-responsive devices encapsu-lating and releasing appropriate components in and from the micelle. In particular, the topology-based polymer materials design should be suitable for human body-related applications including drug delivery system, food, and cosmetics, for which the modification of chemical structure and molecular weight mightinducereasonableconcernoverthetoxicityand biocompatibility.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '6.Topology effects by functional ring polymers having programmed chemical structures', 'Along with the introduction of new synthetic methodologies, an increasing variety of functional ring polymers and oligomers have become obtainable to exploit their topology effects. A number of recent studies are presented in this section, covering a diverse field either by conjugated cyclic oligomers,70 by photo-responsive ring polymers,71,72 by biodegradable ring polyesters,14by temperature-responsive ring polymers,12,13or by pharmaco-logically functional ring polymers.73', 'Conjugated polymers and oligomers have currently been extensively studied primarily due to their potential for diverse electronic and photonic applications.74 Ring-shaped conjugated polymers and oligomers have attracted particular interests as a prototype of the molecularly fabricated electric circuit, since the circulation of electrons/holes might be induced along the ‘‘endless’’ conjugated segments. A wide variety of conjugated ring oligomers possessing the increasing numbers of unsaturated groups have thus been prepared to test their electrochemical properties.70 Fully conjugated large ring polymers, on the other hand, have still been an elusive synthetic challenge. It is notable, moreover, that a twisted, Moebius stripe-like conjugated olig-omer has attracted considerable interests because of their unusual non-H€uckel aromaticity, in contrast to the conventional H€uckel-type aromaticity which is dependent on its planar geometry by conjugated units.75', 'Photo-response behaviors could be influenced by polymer topologies of either ring or linear forms. Thus, a ring polymer having photo-responsive azobenzene units in the main chain was prepared through the bimolecular end-to-end cyclization via click chemistry.71 Upon the irradiation of UV light, both the trans-to-cis and the cis-to-trans isomerization proceeded slightly faster by the ring polymer in comparison with the linear counterpart. This behavior was attributed to the higher topo-logical constraint of the former than the latter counterpart.71 As another example, a ring polystyrene having two photoactive groups, namely fluorene and anthracene units, was prepared through the bimolecular process using a living bifunctional polystyrene produced with an initiator having a fluorene unit and a linking reagent having an anthracene unit.72 The fluo-rescent behavior of the obtained ring polymer was subsequently studied to show the intramolecular energy migration between the two chromophores.72', 'Naturally occurring ring polymers, such as cyclic DNAs, cyclic peptides as well as cyclic polysaccharides,3 and multi-cyclic counterparts like cyclotides,76 are known to exhibit higher stability against biologically induced decomposition. In this relevance, the topology effect of aliphatic biodegradable poly-esters on their decomposition behavior has been investigated.14Thus, ring poly(caprolactone) was prepared through the unim-olecular click polymer cyclization using the corresponding precursor having an azide and an alkyne group. The higher hydrolytic stability was then observed in comparison with the linear counterparts.14 Notably, moreover, such biodegradable ring polyesters by poly(valerolactone) and by poly(lactide) were also prepared.15,30,31,77', 'Temperature-responsivepropertiesofpoly(N-iso-propylacrylamide), poly(NIPAM), have extensively been studied for their eventual uses in the controlled release devices and for the cell–sheet applications.78 The two groups recently reported the topology effects by ring poly(NIPAM)s.12,13 Thus, the two groups prepared linear poly(NIPAM) precursors having alkyne and azide end groups either by a reversible addition–fragmen-tation chain transfer (RAFT) or by an atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) technique, and the unimolecular click process was commonly applied for the subsequent polymer cyclization. The cloud point (TCP) of the obtained ring poly(NIPAM) by one group was several degrees higher than that of the corresponding linear counterpart. In addition, they observed that the phase transition by the ring polymers took place distinctively slower upon heating.12 Another group, on the other hand, observed the ring poly(NIPAM) showing a few degrees lower TCP against the linear counterpart at the higher solution concentration, while higher at the lower solution concentration. Furthermore, they reported the smaller enthalpy change (DH) during the phase transition with the ring poly (NIPAM). These results were accounted for by the suppression of the hydrogen bond interaction between the ring poly(NIPAM) with water molecules due to their topological constraints in comparison with the flexible linear counterpart having free chain ends.13', 'A pharmacological application of ring polymers has recently been demonstrated by elucidating the filtration/elimination mechanism of a kidney through its nanoporous channel.73 Thus, it was anticipated that the ring polymer could remain longer in a body than the linear counterpart, since the former should be reluctant to transform its conformation into a folded shape to traverse through the nanoporous channels of the kidney.73 To test this topology effect, a series of linear and cyclic poly(capro-lactone)s having poly(ethylene glycol) graft segments and having phenolic functionalities for radiolabeling by 125I were prepared. The lower secretion into urine and in turn the higher accumu-lation in various organs was indeed confirmed with the ring polymer having an appropriate molecular weight, corresponding to its hydrodynamic volume.73 These findings may provide new design methodologies for drug carriers and imaging agents via the topology-based control of a blood circulation time.', '7.Conclusions and future perspectives', 'In this review, we have shown a variety of recent achievements in topological polymer chemistry, to focus on novel polymerproperties and functions uniquely revealed by ring polymers. The topology effects, in particular by ring polymers have now offered unique opportunities in polymer materials design unattainable by other means. A viable promise for the practical utilization of the topology effect undoubtedly includes the modification of any existing polymeric materials dependent mostly on linear poly-mers, inflicting little concern on chemical toxicity and environ-mentalpollution.Furthermore,broaderopportunitiesof topology effects by not only single-cyclic but also multi-cyclic polymers are expected in polymer chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, and materials science.', 'Acknowledgements', 'We thank Sekisui Chemical Grant Program for Research on Manufacturing Based on Learning from Nature (Y.T.), The Mitsubishi Foundation (Y.T.), Tokuyama Science Foundation (T.Y.), CASIO Science Promotion Foundation (T.Y.), The Japan Securities Scholarship Foundation (T.Y.), The Kurata Memorial Hitachi Science and Technology Foundation (T.Y.), and Yazaki Memorial Foundation for Science and Technology for financial support.

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25�C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 �C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 �10�4 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 �0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 �C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 �C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by significant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of �4 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers.', '�2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through protonexchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Nafion�as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18].', 'Transport properties and nanostructure of sulfonated polyimide (SPI) membranes have been studied using pulsed field gradient NMR and NMR quadrupolar relaxation rates determinations [19,20], and small angle scattering methods (SAXS and SANS), respectively [21,22].', 'The microstructure of sulfonated polyetherether ketone (sPEEK) has been investigated by SAXS [12]. We recently reported a class of ionomers based on aromatic hydrocarbon copolymers with high proton conductivity and excellent thermal mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states [22e29]. Sulfonated poly-arylenethioethersulfone(SPTES)copolymershavefollowing chemical structures (Fig. 1).', 'SPTES copolymers including SPTES-50, SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80, have equivalent weight (EW) and IEC (mequiv./g) values of 610, 515, 459, 417, and 1.64, 1.94, 2.18, and 2.4, respectively [22]. They exhibited proton conductivity of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm respectively, at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity [22]. Their excellent proton conductivity at high temperatures combined with their high glass transition temperature (w200 �C) and mechanical stability (both in the dry and hydrated states) make them excellent potentials as high temperature PEM materials for fuel cells. SPTES-50 copolymer membrane has successfully been fabricated to membrane electrode assemblies and exhibited polarization curves and durability up to 400 h [29]. Their successful operations at 90e100 �C were limited by boiling point of water (100 �C at 1 atm). Replacing water molecules with heterocycles such as imidazolium where the charge carrier has a very low vapor pressure can result in proton conductivity at higher temperatures. Despite excellent electrochemical properties, excessive water uptake of SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes provide difficulties to be made as membrane electrode assembly [22,27] The proton transport and performance of SPTES copolymers highly depend on the presence of water molecules. In addition to the number of sulfonic groups, their acidity (pKa) ability to dissociate water molecules to proton, water activity coefficient, and number of water molecules associated with each sulfonic group, the supermolecular structure of the hydro-phobic and hydrophilic phases is also defined by polymer chain characteristics such as chain persistent length, and presence of sulfonic group on the backbone or in the side chains. We reported the presence of ionic nanodomains containing water molecules in the SPTES-70 using in-situ x-ray scattering [27]. The morphology and the nanostructure of SPTES-50 were approximated by corre-lated polydisperse spherical aggregates and a larger scale water domain network and were quantified by modeling of the SANS spectra with polydisperse hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [29]. This study reports the nanostructure and morphology of sulfonated polyarylenethioethersulfone (SPTES) copolymer membranes which is directly related to the proton transport through the membrane in terms of their degree of sulfonation and temperature dependency.', '2. Materials and methods', '2.1. Materials', 'Visually observed defect free films of SPTES copolymers were prepared by dissolving the purified copolymer in dimethyl acet-amide (DMAc, Sigma Aldrich) (5e10 wt%) filtering, placing in a flat dish in a vacuum oven with a gradual temperature rise to 100 �C for 24 h and 120 �C for 2 h. The resulting uniform flat films were immersed for 2 h in deionized water and dried under vacuum (24 h, 80 �C) after they were acidified in sulfuric acid (4 M, 24 h) to ensure complete conversion of sulfonic groups to their protonated forms.', '2.2. Characterization', 'SANS experiments were performed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Neutron Center for Research using 30 m NG-7 SANS instrument with a neutron wavelength, l, of 6 Å (Dl/l ¼ 10%) and three sample-to-detector distance of 1.5 m, 10 m (l ¼ 6 Å), and 15 m (l ¼ 8 Å), 0.001 < q < 0.3168 Å�1 at 25, and 55 �C (accuracy of 0.5 �C). Hydrated membranes were placed in demountable 1 mm thick titanium liquid cells filled with D2O after equilibrium in D2O (24 h). Scattered intensities were reduced, corrected for the transmission and background and placed on absolute scale. Then, circularly averaged to produce absolute scale scattering intensity, I(q), as a function of the wave vector, q, where q ¼ (4p/l)sin(q/2) and q is the scattering angle. Calculations were performed using Igor Pro�software [30,31]. USANS experiments covered a q-range of 0.00005 < q (Å�1) < 0.01, corresponding to a real-space length scale of 0.1 microne10 micron.', '3. Results and discussions', '3.1. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 25 �C', 'SPTES copolymers have high proton conductivity at high relative humidities and elevated temperatures; e.g. 65 �C and 85% RH of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers, respectively [27]. The degree of sulfonation increases for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6%, respectively. SPTES-50 copolymer has the lowest the degree of sulfonation and SPTES-80 copolymer has the highest degree of sulfonation in this class of copolymers [22,27]. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers at 25 �C show a scattering behavior of a two phase structure (Fig. 2a). The contribution of sulfonic groups to the scattering is considered to be negligible due to their small volume compared to the polymer and the water phase volume. It was visually observed that membranes do not dissociate when fully hydrated in the examined temperature. It was also determined by weight measurement that the membranes maintain the weight after deswelling. Therefore, the hydrophobic polymeric structure is the supporting network even at high water content and increased temperatures. Fig. 2a presents enhanced scattering intensity data (vertically shifted) for the hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copol-ymer membranes in the order of 20X, 1000X, and 2 �105X for the clarity of data presentation. The absolute scale scattering intensities in the medium q range of 0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1 are almost in the same intensity range for all SPTES copolymers. The high q scattering spectra for all copolymers exhibit a feature which is attributed to the presence of ionic domains containing water molecules. According to the scattering results, the morphology of all hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C can be approximated as correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates with liquid-like ordering (P.Y. ordering) and a power law decay [29]. The scattering data for the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C were compared and quantified using polydisperse (Schulz polydispersity) hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [32e34] and a low q power law decay [29]. The modeling of the SPETS 50 nanostructure and its properties have been reported elsewhere but presented here forclarity and completeness of the SPTES series analysis [29]. Fig. 2b shows the experimental scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 25 �C compared with the theoretical calculations of the model (solid line). The results of the comparison of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes scattering data with the model are summarized in Table 1. According to this modeling the domain radius increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 13.45,14.9,15.4, and 16.9 Å for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes. The hard sphere packing density increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 19.8%, 23%, 25%, 29% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. This could indicate that ionic domains are capable of holding more water molecules with the presence of more sulfonic groups on the polymer backbone (increasing the degree of sulfonation). The high-q scattering spectra exhibits onset of a peak formation when the degree of sulfonation was increased to 71.6% for SPTES-80 copolymer. Pres-ence of scattering maxima can be due to the scattering from an ordered structure (periodicity) or the oscillations resulted from the structural factor effects or the excluded volume effect arising from short range liquid-like ordering. The onset of peak formation is attributed to the excluded volume effects related to the liquid-like ordering [33e35]. The low-q power law decay of nearly �3 was observed for all SPTES copolymers in the range of 1 �10�4 < q (1/ Å) < 3 �10�3. The power law decay of �3 is attributed to the presence of interacting three-dimensional fractal morphology. In addition, a Guinier plateau [35] was present for the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer at the very low q (q (1/Å) < 9 �10�5). This is in addition to the nearly identical scattering intensity in the inter-mediate q-range (0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1). It can be concluded that the change in the degree of sulfonation had little or no effect on the intermediate and low angle scattering wave vector. The low-q power law decay was nearly �3 �0.1 for all SPTES copolymers. The presence of sharp interface between hydrophobic and hydro-philic domains was deduced from the power law decay of �4 at large angle wave vectors for all hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes. All scattering data presented in Fig. 2a shows a power slope of �3.85 to �4.15 which is approximated as w �4. The presence of Porod behavior (decay of �4) has been attributed to the two immiscible phase with a sharp boundary [35e37]. This shows that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are separated with a distinct interface containing sulfonic groups.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Presence of a plateau in the scattering spectra is characteristics of isolated scatterers [35]. The radius of gyration (Rg) of the isolated scatterers can be approximated by IðqÞ ¼ I0expðð�q2R2gÞ=3Þ, where I0 is the extrapolated zero scattering intensity (Guinier approxi-mation) [35]. Presence of the Guinier plateau in the q range of 4.3 �10�5 < q (1/Å) < 8.2 �10�5 for SPTES-80 copolymer suggests segregation of the isolated large scale hydrophilic water pockets when the degree of sulfonation increased to 71.6%. Radius of gyration of the isolated larger scale water pockets in fully hydratedSPTES-80 copolymer membrane was 1.3 �0.18 micron which was calculated from this approximation (Fig. 2c).', '@', '@', '3.2. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 55 �C', 'Based on the physical observations, water saturated membranes at 55 �C were swollen films without visual dissociation. Fig. 3 exhibits the scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. The inter-mediate scattering intensity decreased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes start to form scattering maxima at high q range when the degree of sulfonation increased. This indicated the increase in the excluded volume due to the increase in the volume of the scatterers at higher degree of sulfonation and increased temperature (55 �C). The presence of scattering maxima is more significant for SPTES-70 copolymer and SPTES-80 copolymer with 63.3 and 71.6% degree of sulfonation. The large angle scattering feature shows scattering maxima at qmax of 0.103 and 0.1108 1/Å for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers which correspond to spatial characteristics lengths (l ¼ 2p/qmax) of 60.97 and 56.7 Å due to concentration fluctuations of hydrated domains (hard spheres). The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes changed significantlywith increasing degree of sulfonation. This indicates a substantial change in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology with increasing degree of sulfonation at 55 �C which is more pronounced for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers (degree of sulfonation 63.3 and 71.6%, respectively). Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are segregated distinctly by the sulfonic groups at the interface which is repre-sented by the Porod behavior, asymptotic behavior of w �4 for all SPTES copolymers [35e37]. The morphology of these membranes is complex and controlled by interfacial phenomena. The number of sulfonic groups per repeat unit volume and their acidity com-plemented with the chain persistent length and chain mobility are governing factors in the formed morphology. This study approxi-mates the morphology of the fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55 �C are approximated as spherical nanodomains containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering similar to their morphology at 25 �C. It is also proposed that this morphology changedtofractalmorphologywithincreasing temperature (increasing the intermediate scattering decay). The domain radius and the sphere packing density were increased from 26.4 Å and 28% for SPTES-50 copolymer to 32 Å and 33% for SPTES-60copolymerwhiletheintermediatescatteringintensity decreased. The domain radius and packing density of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane increased from 13.45 Å and 19.8% to 26.4 Å and 28% when the temperature increased from 25 �C to 55 �C with this approximation. The same increasing trend of 14.9 Åe32 Å for the average domain radius and 23%e33% of the sphere packing density was observed. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane compared to the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane is attributed to the disruption of the large scale morphology. The low q power law decay of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane was close to the decay of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane.', 'The increase in the degree of sulfonation of SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymers from 54.9, to 63.3 and 71.6% resulted in a shift in the position of the high q scattering maxima of the hydrated membranes toward the large angle scattering regime. This peak formation is more prominent for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copoly-mers with higher sulfonation degree. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering intensity in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70 and-80 copolymers is attributed to the loss of the large scale water network, intermediate fractal morphology within the polymer and onset of a morphology change to a two large scale phase morphology. The closed domain morphology of polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with fractal network were present for fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55�C (Figs. 3 and 4a). However, substantialchangesinthemorphologyoffullyhydrated membranes occurred when the degree of sulfonation is increased to 63.3 and 71.6% for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers at higher temperature of 55 �C. Combination of high temperature, high density of sulfonic groups, and significant amount of water mole-cules within the polymer backbone could have resulted in the coalescence of the small spherical ionic domains and fractal water network into a larger scale bicontinuous network of intermeshed hydrophobic and hydrophilic morphology for fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane at 55 �C. The bicontinuous model origi-nally proposed for micro-emulsion of two immiscible phases of water and oil with comparable amount based on Landau theory [38,39]. This model describes two irregular shapes with distinct boundary and has been used for intermesh of hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure when the particle shape is not well-defined [40,41]. This model proposes I(q) ¼ (a2þc1q þ c2q2)�1 for a2 > 0, c1 < 0, and c2 > 0, a single broad scattering maxima, and power law decay of �4 at large scattering angles. Two characteristics lengths of d and x are deduced from this analysis having a2, c1, and c2[39,40], d is the domain periodicity or interdomain distance and x is the correlation length which has been attributed to the dispersion of d. According to this theory, c1 is negative due to the surfactant. The absolute values of c1 and the ratio of x/d should increase with increasing surfactant. The specific internal surface area can be derived from the ratio of S/V ¼ 44(1�4)/x [38,39].', 'The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane has a low-q upturn, a lower intermediate scattering intensity compared to the hydrated SPTES-60 and SPTES-50 copolymers, and a large angle maxima followed by a power law decay of �4. This indicates the onset of the coalescence of the ionic aggregates, disruption of the fractal water network, and the formation of the two irregular large scale bicontinuous phase morphology. The high q range (q > 0.037 1/Å) of the scatteringspectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 55 �C was compared with the T.S. bicontinuous model (Fig. 4b). This simulation resulted in a periodicity, d, of 59.9 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima position, 60.97 Å. According to this simulation, the correlation length (x) is 31.14 Å. The medium-q range scattering still exhibits the larger scale morphology which is not completely converted to the bi-continuous phase morphology. However, they are partially collapsed characterized by a lower scattering intensity in the intermediate q range. The high q maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 is approximated as bicontinuous morphology. The low and medium q (q < 0.037 1/Å) scattering spectra of the SPTES 70 is due to the presence of fractal network of waters which have not coalesce yet.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The scattering spectra of the SPTES-80 copolymer are consistent with a bicontinuous two phase structure of irregular shapes with sulfonic groups as interfacial ionic region. The scattering experi-mental data of the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was compared with this model (q > 0.015 1/Å), (Fig. 4c and Table 2). The periodicity of the water domains (or hydrophobic domains), d, predicted by this model is w54 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima (qmax), 56.7 Å. This value is the distance between water domains. The correlation length (x) obtained from this model is 37.86 Å which is a measure of dispersion.', 'The distance between the water phases, periodicity, was decreased from 59.9 Å to 54 Å with increasing degree of sulfona-tion. The correlation length, x, was increased from 31.14 Å to 37.86 Å when the degree of sulfonation increased. Increasing the interfacial area results in an increase in the x/d ratio. The presence of the upturn in the low range of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 at 55 �C (Fig. 4b and c) is attributed to the fractal morphology of the large scale features.', '3.3. Discussions', 'Scattering data of series of SPTES membranes were obtained in the full hydration state with increasing the sulfonation degree in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. Complete study was performed to provide understanding membranes morphology with increasing the temperature of the hydrated membranes from 25 �C to 55 �C. Proposed model assumes spherical nanodomains containing water molecules forming from clustering of the sulfonation groups. This assumption was performed based on previously reported study which showed spherical nanodomains in the dry SPTES 50 membrane under HR-TEM [29]. The scattering spectra of the membranes with high degree of sulfonation (SPTES 70, and 80) changed significantly when the temperature increased to 55 �C. The morphology is approximated as bi-continuous system where the hydrocarbon is the main support network containing water. This model has been recently proposed by Wnek et al. [40], Gebel [8], and Kreuer [12], Wnek also provided visualization of the hydro-phobic cluster using SYBYL version 6.7 (Tripos) and HINT (Hydro-pathicINTeractions)computationalmodelingsoftware[40]. Despite the support of the transport studies of this model [42],there is no direct visualization method for this proposed approxi-mation. The T. S. model is also supported by high proton conduc-tivity of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 membranes at 55 �C where a larger number of hydronium ions in a larger domain can facilitate proton transport. A summary of the structural evolution of the SPTES membranes as a function of temperature and degree of sulfonation is illustrated in Table 3. This study attempted to study a full range of SPTES membrane nanostructure for the first time and provide an understanding of large membrane water uptakes, and their morphology and their relation with high conductivity of the membranes using both liquid like ordering of polydisperse nano-spheres and bi-continuous T.S. model approximation.', '@', '@', 'Table 3 Summary of membrane structural changes (SPTES 50, 60, 70, and 80 at 25 �C, and SPTES 50 and 60 at 55 �C) as a function of degree of sulfonation and temperature by polydisperse hard sphere model with liquid-like ordering ordering).

Conclusions', 'A series of SPTES copolymers with high proton conductivity of 100e215 mS/cm at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity as potential fuel cells membranes were studied.

This model predicted that the increase in the degree of sulfonation resulted in an increase in the radius of ionic domains and an increase in the volume packing density of water in the aggregates. It was assumed that the same morphology of polydisperse correlated spherical ionic domains were present in the SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymers when the temperature increased to 55 �C. Increase in the degree of sulfonation for fully hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer at 55 �C led to a substantial reorganization of the membrane morphology which was described by a bi-continuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic network.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to thank the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Nano-structured andBiological Materials Branch forfunding this research.

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25�C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 �C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 �10�4 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 �0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 �C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 �C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by significant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of �4 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers.', '�2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through protonexchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Nafion�as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18].', 'Transport properties and nanostructure of sulfonated polyimide (SPI) membranes have been studied using pulsed field gradient NMR and NMR quadrupolar relaxation rates determinations [19,20], and small angle scattering methods (SAXS and SANS), respectively [21,22].', 'The microstructure of sulfonated polyetherether ketone (sPEEK) has been investigated by SAXS [12]. We recently reported a class of ionomers based on aromatic hydrocarbon copolymers with high proton conductivity and excellent thermal mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states [22e29]. Sulfonated poly-arylenethioethersulfone(SPTES)copolymershavefollowing chemical structures (Fig. 1).', 'SPTES copolymers including SPTES-50, SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80, have equivalent weight (EW) and IEC (mequiv./g) values of 610, 515, 459, 417, and 1.64, 1.94, 2.18, and 2.4, respectively [22]. They exhibited proton conductivity of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm respectively, at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity [22]. Their excellent proton conductivity at high temperatures combined with their high glass transition temperature (w200 �C) and mechanical stability (both in the dry and hydrated states) make them excellent potentials as high temperature PEM materials for fuel cells. SPTES-50 copolymer membrane has successfully been fabricated to membrane electrode assemblies and exhibited polarization curves and durability up to 400 h [29]. Their successful operations at 90e100 �C were limited by boiling point of water (100 �C at 1 atm). Replacing water molecules with heterocycles such as imidazolium where the charge carrier has a very low vapor pressure can result in proton conductivity at higher temperatures. Despite excellent electrochemical properties, excessive water uptake of SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes provide difficulties to be made as membrane electrode assembly [22,27] The proton transport and performance of SPTES copolymers highly depend on the presence of water molecules. In addition to the number of sulfonic groups, their acidity (pKa) ability to dissociate water molecules to proton, water activity coefficient, and number of water molecules associated with each sulfonic group, the supermolecular structure of the hydro-phobic and hydrophilic phases is also defined by polymer chain characteristics such as chain persistent length, and presence of sulfonic group on the backbone or in the side chains. We reported the presence of ionic nanodomains containing water molecules in the SPTES-70 using in-situ x-ray scattering [27]. The morphology and the nanostructure of SPTES-50 were approximated by corre-lated polydisperse spherical aggregates and a larger scale water domain network and were quantified by modeling of the SANS spectra with polydisperse hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [29]. This study reports the nanostructure and morphology of sulfonated polyarylenethioethersulfone (SPTES) copolymer membranes which is directly related to the proton transport through the membrane in terms of their degree of sulfonation and temperature dependency.', '2. Materials and methods', '2.1. Materials', 'Visually observed defect free films of SPTES copolymers were prepared by dissolving the purified copolymer in dimethyl acet-amide (DMAc, Sigma Aldrich) (5e10 wt%) filtering, placing in a flat dish in a vacuum oven with a gradual temperature rise to 100 �C for 24 h and 120 �C for 2 h. The resulting uniform flat films were immersed for 2 h in deionized water and dried under vacuum (24 h, 80 �C) after they were acidified in sulfuric acid (4 M, 24 h) to ensure complete conversion of sulfonic groups to their protonated forms.', '2.2. Characterization', 'SANS experiments were performed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Neutron Center for Research using 30 m NG-7 SANS instrument with a neutron wavelength, l, of 6 Å (Dl/l ¼ 10%) and three sample-to-detector distance of 1.5 m, 10 m (l ¼ 6 Å), and 15 m (l ¼ 8 Å), 0.001 < q < 0.3168 Å�1 at 25, and 55 �C (accuracy of 0.5 �C). Hydrated membranes were placed in demountable 1 mm thick titanium liquid cells filled with D2O after equilibrium in D2O (24 h). Scattered intensities were reduced, corrected for the transmission and background and placed on absolute scale. Then, circularly averaged to produce absolute scale scattering intensity, I(q), as a function of the wave vector, q, where q ¼ (4p/l)sin(q/2) and q is the scattering angle. Calculations were performed using Igor Pro�software [30,31]. USANS experiments covered a q-range of 0.00005 < q (Å�1) < 0.01, corresponding to a real-space length scale of 0.1 microne10 micron.', '3. Results and discussions', '3.1. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 25 �C', 'SPTES copolymers have high proton conductivity at high relative humidities and elevated temperatures; e.g. 65 �C and 85% RH of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers, respectively [27]. The degree of sulfonation increases for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6%, respectively. SPTES-50 copolymer has the lowest the degree of sulfonation and SPTES-80 copolymer has the highest degree of sulfonation in this class of copolymers [22,27]. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers at 25 �C show a scattering behavior of a two phase structure (Fig. 2a). The contribution of sulfonic groups to the scattering is considered to be negligible due to their small volume compared to the polymer and the water phase volume. It was visually observed that membranes do not dissociate when fully hydrated in the examined temperature. It was also determined by weight measurement that the membranes maintain the weight after deswelling. Therefore, the hydrophobic polymeric structure is the supporting network even at high water content and increased temperatures. Fig. 2a presents enhanced scattering intensity data (vertically shifted) for the hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copol-ymer membranes in the order of 20X, 1000X, and 2 �105X for the clarity of data presentation. The absolute scale scattering intensities in the medium q range of 0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1 are almost in the same intensity range for all SPTES copolymers. The high q scattering spectra for all copolymers exhibit a feature which is attributed to the presence of ionic domains containing water molecules. According to the scattering results, the morphology of all hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C can be approximated as correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates with liquid-like ordering (P.Y. ordering) and a power law decay [29]. The scattering data for the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C were compared and quantified using polydisperse (Schulz polydispersity) hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [32e34] and a low q power law decay [29]. The modeling of the SPETS 50 nanostructure and its properties have been reported elsewhere but presented here forclarity and completeness of the SPTES series analysis [29]. Fig. 2b shows the experimental scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 25 �C compared with the theoretical calculations of the model (solid line). The results of the comparison of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes scattering data with the model are summarized in Table 1. According to this modeling the domain radius increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 13.45,14.9,15.4, and 16.9 Å for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes. The hard sphere packing density increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 19.8%, 23%, 25%, 29% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. This could indicate that ionic domains are capable of holding more water molecules with the presence of more sulfonic groups on the polymer backbone (increasing the degree of sulfonation). The high-q scattering spectra exhibits onset of a peak formation when the degree of sulfonation was increased to 71.6% for SPTES-80 copolymer. Pres-ence of scattering maxima can be due to the scattering from an ordered structure (periodicity) or the oscillations resulted from the structural factor effects or the excluded volume effect arising from short range liquid-like ordering. The onset of peak formation is attributed to the excluded volume effects related to the liquid-like ordering [33e35]. The low-q power law decay of nearly �3 was observed for all SPTES copolymers in the range of 1 �10�4 < q (1/ Å) < 3 �10�3. The power law decay of �3 is attributed to the presence of interacting three-dimensional fractal morphology. In addition, a Guinier plateau [35] was present for the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer at the very low q (q (1/Å) < 9 �10�5). This is in addition to the nearly identical scattering intensity in the inter-mediate q-range (0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1). It can be concluded that the change in the degree of sulfonation had little or no effect on the intermediate and low angle scattering wave vector. The low-q power law decay was nearly �3 �0.1 for all SPTES copolymers. The presence of sharp interface between hydrophobic and hydro-philic domains was deduced from the power law decay of �4 at large angle wave vectors for all hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes. All scattering data presented in Fig. 2a shows a power slope of �3.85 to �4.15 which is approximated as w �4. The presence of Porod behavior (decay of �4) has been attributed to the two immiscible phase with a sharp boundary [35e37]. This shows that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are separated with a distinct interface containing sulfonic groups.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Presence of a plateau in the scattering spectra is characteristics of isolated scatterers [35]. The radius of gyration (Rg) of the isolated scatterers can be approximated by IðqÞ ¼ I0expðð�q2R2gÞ=3Þ, where I0 is the extrapolated zero scattering intensity (Guinier approxi-mation) [35]. Presence of the Guinier plateau in the q range of 4.3 �10�5 < q (1/Å) < 8.2 �10�5 for SPTES-80 copolymer suggests segregation of the isolated large scale hydrophilic water pockets when the degree of sulfonation increased to 71.6%. Radius of gyration of the isolated larger scale water pockets in fully hydratedSPTES-80 copolymer membrane was 1.3 �0.18 micron which was calculated from this approximation (Fig. 2c).', '@', '@', '3.2. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 55 �C', 'Based on the physical observations, water saturated membranes at 55 �C were swollen films without visual dissociation. Fig. 3 exhibits the scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. The inter-mediate scattering intensity decreased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes start to form scattering maxima at high q range when the degree of sulfonation increased. This indicated the increase in the excluded volume due to the increase in the volume of the scatterers at higher degree of sulfonation and increased temperature (55 �C). The presence of scattering maxima is more significant for SPTES-70 copolymer and SPTES-80 copolymer with 63.3 and 71.6% degree of sulfonation. The large angle scattering feature shows scattering maxima at qmax of 0.103 and 0.1108 1/Å for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers which correspond to spatial characteristics lengths (l ¼ 2p/qmax) of 60.97 and 56.7 Å due to concentration fluctuations of hydrated domains (hard spheres). The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes changed significantlywith increasing degree of sulfonation. This indicates a substantial change in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology with increasing degree of sulfonation at 55 �C which is more pronounced for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers (degree of sulfonation 63.3 and 71.6%, respectively). Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are segregated distinctly by the sulfonic groups at the interface which is repre-sented by the Porod behavior, asymptotic behavior of w �4 for all SPTES copolymers [35e37]. The morphology of these membranes is complex and controlled by interfacial phenomena. The number of sulfonic groups per repeat unit volume and their acidity com-plemented with the chain persistent length and chain mobility are governing factors in the formed morphology. This study approxi-mates the morphology of the fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55 �C are approximated as spherical nanodomains containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering similar to their morphology at 25 �C. It is also proposed that this morphology changedtofractalmorphologywithincreasing temperature (increasing the intermediate scattering decay). The domain radius and the sphere packing density were increased from 26.4 Å and 28% for SPTES-50 copolymer to 32 Å and 33% for SPTES-60copolymerwhiletheintermediatescatteringintensity decreased. The domain radius and packing density of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane increased from 13.45 Å and 19.8% to 26.4 Å and 28% when the temperature increased from 25 �C to 55 �C with this approximation. The same increasing trend of 14.9 Åe32 Å for the average domain radius and 23%e33% of the sphere packing density was observed. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane compared to the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane is attributed to the disruption of the large scale morphology. The low q power law decay of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane was close to the decay of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane.', 'The increase in the degree of sulfonation of SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymers from 54.9, to 63.3 and 71.6% resulted in a shift in the position of the high q scattering maxima of the hydrated membranes toward the large angle scattering regime. This peak formation is more prominent for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copoly-mers with higher sulfonation degree. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering intensity in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70 and-80 copolymers is attributed to the loss of the large scale water network, intermediate fractal morphology within the polymer and onset of a morphology change to a two large scale phase morphology. The closed domain morphology of polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with fractal network were present for fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55�C (Figs. 3 and 4a). However, substantialchangesinthemorphologyoffullyhydrated membranes occurred when the degree of sulfonation is increased to 63.3 and 71.6% for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers at higher temperature of 55 �C. Combination of high temperature, high density of sulfonic groups, and significant amount of water mole-cules within the polymer backbone could have resulted in the coalescence of the small spherical ionic domains and fractal water network into a larger scale bicontinuous network of intermeshed hydrophobic and hydrophilic morphology for fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane at 55 �C. The bicontinuous model origi-nally proposed for micro-emulsion of two immiscible phases of water and oil with comparable amount based on Landau theory [38,39]. This model describes two irregular shapes with distinct boundary and has been used for intermesh of hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure when the particle shape is not well-defined [40,41]. This model proposes I(q) ¼ (a2þc1q þ c2q2)�1 for a2 > 0, c1 < 0, and c2 > 0, a single broad scattering maxima, and power law decay of �4 at large scattering angles. Two characteristics lengths of d and x are deduced from this analysis having a2, c1, and c2[39,40], d is the domain periodicity or interdomain distance and x is the correlation length which has been attributed to the dispersion of d. According to this theory, c1 is negative due to the surfactant. The absolute values of c1 and the ratio of x/d should increase with increasing surfactant. The specific internal surface area can be derived from the ratio of S/V ¼ 44(1�4)/x [38,39].', 'The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane has a low-q upturn, a lower intermediate scattering intensity compared to the hydrated SPTES-60 and SPTES-50 copolymers, and a large angle maxima followed by a power law decay of �4. This indicates the onset of the coalescence of the ionic aggregates, disruption of the fractal water network, and the formation of the two irregular large scale bicontinuous phase morphology. The high q range (q > 0.037 1/Å) of the scatteringspectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 55 �C was compared with the T.S. bicontinuous model (Fig. 4b). This simulation resulted in a periodicity, d, of 59.9 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima position, 60.97 Å. According to this simulation, the correlation length (x) is 31.14 Å. The medium-q range scattering still exhibits the larger scale morphology which is not completely converted to the bi-continuous phase morphology. However, they are partially collapsed characterized by a lower scattering intensity in the intermediate q range. The high q maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 is approximated as bicontinuous morphology. The low and medium q (q < 0.037 1/Å) scattering spectra of the SPTES 70 is due to the presence of fractal network of waters which have not coalesce yet.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The scattering spectra of the SPTES-80 copolymer are consistent with a bicontinuous two phase structure of irregular shapes with sulfonic groups as interfacial ionic region. The scattering experi-mental data of the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was compared with this model (q > 0.015 1/Å), (Fig. 4c and Table 2). The periodicity of the water domains (or hydrophobic domains), d, predicted by this model is w54 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima (qmax), 56.7 Å. This value is the distance between water domains. The correlation length (x) obtained from this model is 37.86 Å which is a measure of dispersion.', 'The distance between the water phases, periodicity, was decreased from 59.9 Å to 54 Å with increasing degree of sulfona-tion. The correlation length, x, was increased from 31.14 Å to 37.86 Å when the degree of sulfonation increased. Increasing the interfacial area results in an increase in the x/d ratio. The presence of the upturn in the low range of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 at 55 �C (Fig. 4b and c) is attributed to the fractal morphology of the large scale features.', '3.3. Discussions', 'Scattering data of series of SPTES membranes were obtained in the full hydration state with increasing the sulfonation degree in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. Complete study was performed to provide understanding membranes morphology with increasing the temperature of the hydrated membranes from 25 �C to 55 �C. Proposed model assumes spherical nanodomains containing water molecules forming from clustering of the sulfonation groups. This assumption was performed based on previously reported study which showed spherical nanodomains in the dry SPTES 50 membrane under HR-TEM [29]. The scattering spectra of the membranes with high degree of sulfonation (SPTES 70, and 80) changed significantly when the temperature increased to 55 �C. The morphology is approximated as bi-continuous system where the hydrocarbon is the main support network containing water. This model has been recently proposed by Wnek et al. [40], Gebel [8], and Kreuer [12], Wnek also provided visualization of the hydro-phobic cluster using SYBYL version 6.7 (Tripos) and HINT (Hydro-pathicINTeractions)computationalmodelingsoftware[40]. Despite the support of the transport studies of this model [42],there is no direct visualization method for this proposed approxi-mation. The T. S. model is also supported by high proton conduc-tivity of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 membranes at 55 �C where a larger number of hydronium ions in a larger domain can facilitate proton transport. A summary of the structural evolution of the SPTES membranes as a function of temperature and degree of sulfonation is illustrated in Table 3. This study attempted to study a full range of SPTES membrane nanostructure for the first time and provide an understanding of large membrane water uptakes, and their morphology and their relation with high conductivity of the membranes using both liquid like ordering of polydisperse nano-spheres and bi-continuous T.S. model approximation.', '@', '@', 'Table 3 Summary of membrane structural changes (SPTES 50, 60, 70, and 80 at 25 �C, and SPTES 50 and 60 at 55 �C) as a function of degree of sulfonation and temperature by polydisperse hard sphere model with liquid-like ordering ordering). T.S. bi-continuous model was approximated for higher sulfonation degree copolymers, SPTES 70 and 80, at 55 �C.', '@', '4. Conclusions', 'A series of SPTES copolymers with high proton conductivity of 100e215 mS/cm at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity as potential fuel cells membranes were studied. SANS studies of fully hydrated membranes showed that the nanostructure of the fully hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C in agreement with ionic aggregates containing water molecules with a large scale morphology network of water pockets morphology. This model predicted that the increase in the degree of sulfonation resulted in an increase in the radius of ionic domains and an increase in the volume packing density of water in the aggregates. It was assumed that the same morphology of polydisperse correlated spherical ionic domains were present in the SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymers when the temperature increased to 55 �C. Increase in the degree of sulfonation for fully hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer at 55 �C led to a substantial reorganization of the membrane morphology which was described by a bi-continuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic network.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to thank the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Nano-structured andBiological Materials Branch forfunding this research.

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25�C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 �C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 �10�4 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 �0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 �C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 �C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by significant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of �4 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers.', '�2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through protonexchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Nafion�as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18].', 'Transport properties and nanostructure of sulfonated polyimide (SPI) membranes have been studied using pulsed field gradient NMR and NMR quadrupolar relaxation rates determinations [19,20], and small angle scattering methods (SAXS and SANS), respectively [21,22].', 'The microstructure of sulfonated polyetherether ketone (sPEEK) has been investigated by SAXS [12]. We recently reported a class of ionomers based on aromatic hydrocarbon copolymers with high proton conductivity and excellent thermal mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states [22e29]. Sulfonated poly-arylenethioethersulfone(SPTES)copolymershavefollowing chemical structures (Fig. 1).', 'SPTES copolymers including SPTES-50, SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80, have equivalent weight (EW) and IEC (mequiv./g) values of 610, 515, 459, 417, and 1.64, 1.94, 2.18, and 2.4, respectively [22]. They exhibited proton conductivity of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm respectively, at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity [22]. Their excellent proton conductivity at high temperatures combined with their high glass transition temperature (w200 �C) and mechanical stability (both in the dry and hydrated states) make them excellent potentials as high temperature PEM materials for fuel cells. SPTES-50 copolymer membrane has successfully been fabricated to membrane electrode assemblies and exhibited polarization curves and durability up to 400 h [29]. Their successful operations at 90e100 �C were limited by boiling point of water (100 �C at 1 atm). Replacing water molecules with heterocycles such as imidazolium where the charge carrier has a very low vapor pressure can result in proton conductivity at higher temperatures. Despite excellent electrochemical properties, excessive water uptake of SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes provide difficulties to be made as membrane electrode assembly [22,27] The proton transport and performance of SPTES copolymers highly depend on the presence of water molecules. In addition to the number of sulfonic groups, their acidity (pKa) ability to dissociate water molecules to proton, water activity coefficient, and number of water molecules associated with each sulfonic group, the supermolecular structure of the hydro-phobic and hydrophilic phases is also defined by polymer chain characteristics such as chain persistent length, and presence of sulfonic group on the backbone or in the side chains. We reported the presence of ionic nanodomains containing water molecules in the SPTES-70 using in-situ x-ray scattering [27]. The morphology and the nanostructure of SPTES-50 were approximated by corre-lated polydisperse spherical aggregates and a larger scale water domain network and were quantified by modeling of the SANS spectra with polydisperse hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [29]. This study reports the nanostructure and morphology of sulfonated polyarylenethioethersulfone (SPTES) copolymer membranes which is directly related to the proton transport through the membrane in terms of their degree of sulfonation and temperature dependency.', '2. Materials and methods', '2.1. Materials', 'Visually observed defect free films of SPTES copolymers were prepared by dissolving the purified copolymer in dimethyl acet-amide (DMAc, Sigma Aldrich) (5e10 wt%) filtering, placing in a flat dish in a vacuum oven with a gradual temperature rise to 100 �C for 24 h and 120 �C for 2 h. The resulting uniform flat films were immersed for 2 h in deionized water and dried under vacuum (24 h, 80 �C) after they were acidified in sulfuric acid (4 M, 24 h) to ensure complete conversion of sulfonic groups to their protonated forms.', '2.2. Characterization', 'SANS experiments were performed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Neutron Center for Research using 30 m NG-7 SANS instrument with a neutron wavelength, l, of 6 Å (Dl/l ¼ 10%) and three sample-to-detector distance of 1.5 m, 10 m (l ¼ 6 Å), and 15 m (l ¼ 8 Å), 0.001 < q < 0.3168 Å�1 at 25, and 55 �C (accuracy of 0.5 �C). Hydrated membranes were placed in demountable 1 mm thick titanium liquid cells filled with D2O after equilibrium in D2O (24 h). Scattered intensities were reduced, corrected for the transmission and background and placed on absolute scale. Then, circularly averaged to produce absolute scale scattering intensity, I(q), as a function of the wave vector, q, where q ¼ (4p/l)sin(q/2) and q is the scattering angle. Calculations were performed using Igor Pro�software [30,31]. USANS experiments covered a q-range of 0.00005 < q (Å�1) < 0.01, corresponding to a real-space length scale of 0.1 microne10 micron.', '3. Results and discussions', '3.1. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 25 �C', 'SPTES copolymers have high proton conductivity at high relative humidities and elevated temperatures; e.g. 65 �C and 85% RH of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers, respectively [27]. The degree of sulfonation increases for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6%, respectively. SPTES-50 copolymer has the lowest the degree of sulfonation and SPTES-80 copolymer has the highest degree of sulfonation in this class of copolymers [22,27]. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers at 25 �C show a scattering behavior of a two phase structure (Fig. 2a). The contribution of sulfonic groups to the scattering is considered to be negligible due to their small volume compared to the polymer and the water phase volume. It was visually observed that membranes do not dissociate when fully hydrated in the examined temperature. It was also determined by weight measurement that the membranes maintain the weight after deswelling. Therefore, the hydrophobic polymeric structure is the supporting network even at high water content and increased temperatures. Fig. 2a presents enhanced scattering intensity data (vertically shifted) for the hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copol-ymer membranes in the order of 20X, 1000X, and 2 �105X for the clarity of data presentation. The absolute scale scattering intensities in the medium q range of 0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1 are almost in the same intensity range for all SPTES copolymers. The high q scattering spectra for all copolymers exhibit a feature which is attributed to the presence of ionic domains containing water molecules. According to the scattering results, the morphology of all hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C can be approximated as correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates with liquid-like ordering (P.Y. ordering) and a power law decay [29]. The scattering data for the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C were compared and quantified using polydisperse (Schulz polydispersity) hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [32e34] and a low q power law decay [29]. The modeling of the SPETS 50 nanostructure and its properties have been reported elsewhere but presented here forclarity and completeness of the SPTES series analysis [29]. Fig. 2b shows the experimental scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 25 �C compared with the theoretical calculations of the model (solid line). The results of the comparison of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes scattering data with the model are summarized in Table 1. According to this modeling the domain radius increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 13.45,14.9,15.4, and 16.9 Å for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes. The hard sphere packing density increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 19.8%, 23%, 25%, 29% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. This could indicate that ionic domains are capable of holding more water molecules with the presence of more sulfonic groups on the polymer backbone (increasing the degree of sulfonation). The high-q scattering spectra exhibits onset of a peak formation when the degree of sulfonation was increased to 71.6% for SPTES-80 copolymer. Pres-ence of scattering maxima can be due to the scattering from an ordered structure (periodicity) or the oscillations resulted from the structural factor effects or the excluded volume effect arising from short range liquid-like ordering. The onset of peak formation is attributed to the excluded volume effects related to the liquid-like ordering [33e35]. The low-q power law decay of nearly �3 was observed for all SPTES copolymers in the range of 1 �10�4 < q (1/ Å) < 3 �10�3. The power law decay of �3 is attributed to the presence of interacting three-dimensional fractal morphology. In addition, a Guinier plateau [35] was present for the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer at the very low q (q (1/Å) < 9 �10�5). This is in addition to the nearly identical scattering intensity in the inter-mediate q-range (0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1). It can be concluded that the change in the degree of sulfonation had little or no effect on the intermediate and low angle scattering wave vector. The low-q power law decay was nearly �3 �0.1 for all SPTES copolymers. The presence of sharp interface between hydrophobic and hydro-philic domains was deduced from the power law decay of �4 at large angle wave vectors for all hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes. All scattering data presented in Fig. 2a shows a power slope of �3.85 to �4.15 which is approximated as w �4. The presence of Porod behavior (decay of �4) has been attributed to the two immiscible phase with a sharp boundary [35e37]. This shows that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are separated with a distinct interface containing sulfonic groups.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Presence of a plateau in the scattering spectra is characteristics of isolated scatterers [35]. The radius of gyration (Rg) of the isolated scatterers can be approximated by IðqÞ ¼ I0expðð�q2R2gÞ=3Þ, where I0 is the extrapolated zero scattering intensity (Guinier approxi-mation) [35]. Presence of the Guinier plateau in the q range of 4.3 �10�5 < q (1/Å) < 8.2 �10�5 for SPTES-80 copolymer suggests segregation of the isolated large scale hydrophilic water pockets when the degree of sulfonation increased to 71.6%. Radius of gyration of the isolated larger scale water pockets in fully hydratedSPTES-80 copolymer membrane was 1.3 �0.18 micron which was calculated from this approximation (Fig. 2c).', '@', '@', '3.2. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 55 �C', 'Based on the physical observations, water saturated membranes at 55 �C were swollen films without visual dissociation. Fig. 3 exhibits the scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. The inter-mediate scattering intensity decreased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes start to form scattering maxima at high q range when the degree of sulfonation increased. This indicated the increase in the excluded volume due to the increase in the volume of the scatterers at higher degree of sulfonation and increased temperature (55 �C). The presence of scattering maxima is more significant for SPTES-70 copolymer and SPTES-80 copolymer with 63.3 and 71.6% degree of sulfonation. The large angle scattering feature shows scattering maxima at qmax of 0.103 and 0.1108 1/Å for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers which correspond to spatial characteristics lengths (l ¼ 2p/qmax) of 60.97 and 56.7 Å due to concentration fluctuations of hydrated domains (hard spheres). The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes changed significantlywith increasing degree of sulfonation. This indicates a substantial change in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology with increasing degree of sulfonation at 55 �C which is more pronounced for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers (degree of sulfonation 63.3 and 71.6%, respectively). Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are segregated distinctly by the sulfonic groups at the interface which is repre-sented by the Porod behavior, asymptotic behavior of w �4 for all SPTES copolymers [35e37]. The morphology of these membranes is complex and controlled by interfacial phenomena. The number of sulfonic groups per repeat unit volume and their acidity com-plemented with the chain persistent length and chain mobility are governing factors in the formed morphology. This study approxi-mates the morphology of the fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55 �C are approximated as spherical nanodomains containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering similar to their morphology at 25 �C. It is also proposed that this morphology changedtofractalmorphologywithincreasing temperature (increasing the intermediate scattering decay). The domain radius and the sphere packing density were increased from 26.4 Å and 28% for SPTES-50 copolymer to 32 Å and 33% for SPTES-60copolymerwhiletheintermediatescatteringintensity decreased. The domain radius and packing density of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane increased from 13.45 Å and 19.8% to 26.4 Å and 28% when the temperature increased from 25 �C to 55 �C with this approximation. The same increasing trend of 14.9 Åe32 Å for the average domain radius and 23%e33% of the sphere packing density was observed. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane compared to the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane is attributed to the disruption of the large scale morphology. The low q power law decay of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane was close to the decay of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane.', 'The increase in the degree of sulfonation of SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymers from 54.9, to 63.3 and 71.6% resulted in a shift in the position of the high q scattering maxima of the hydrated membranes toward the large angle scattering regime. This peak formation is more prominent for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copoly-mers with higher sulfonation degree. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering intensity in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70 and-80 copolymers is attributed to the loss of the large scale water network, intermediate fractal morphology within the polymer and onset of a morphology change to a two large scale phase morphology. The closed domain morphology of polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with fractal network were present for fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55�C (Figs. 3 and 4a). However, substantialchangesinthemorphologyoffullyhydrated membranes occurred when the degree of sulfonation is increased to 63.3 and 71.6% for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers at higher temperature of 55 �C. Combination of high temperature, high density of sulfonic groups, and significant amount of water mole-cules within the polymer backbone could have resulted in the coalescence of the small spherical ionic domains and fractal water network into a larger scale bicontinuous network of intermeshed hydrophobic and hydrophilic morphology for fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane at 55 �C. The bicontinuous model origi-nally proposed for micro-emulsion of two immiscible phases of water and oil with comparable amount based on Landau theory [38,39]. This model describes two irregular shapes with distinct boundary and has been used for intermesh of hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure when the particle shape is not well-defined [40,41]. This model proposes I(q) ¼ (a2þc1q þ c2q2)�1 for a2 > 0, c1 < 0, and c2 > 0, a single broad scattering maxima, and power law decay of �4 at large scattering angles. Two characteristics lengths of d and x are deduced from this analysis having a2, c1, and c2[39,40], d is the domain periodicity or interdomain distance and x is the correlation length which has been attributed to the dispersion of d. According to this theory, c1 is negative due to the surfactant. The absolute values of c1 and the ratio of x/d should increase with increasing surfactant. The specific internal surface area can be derived from the ratio of S/V ¼ 44(1�4)/x [38,39].', 'The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane has a low-q upturn, a lower intermediate scattering intensity compared to the hydrated SPTES-60 and SPTES-50 copolymers, and a large angle maxima followed by a power law decay of �4. This indicates the onset of the coalescence of the ionic aggregates, disruption of the fractal water network, and the formation of the two irregular large scale bicontinuous phase morphology. The high q range (q > 0.037 1/Å) of the scatteringspectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 55 �C was compared with the T.S. bicontinuous model (Fig. 4b). This simulation resulted in a periodicity, d, of 59.9 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima position, 60.97 Å. According to this simulation, the correlation length (x) is 31.14 Å. The medium-q range scattering still exhibits the larger scale morphology which is not completely converted to the bi-continuous phase morphology. However, they are partially collapsed characterized by a lower scattering intensity in the intermediate q range. The high q maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 is approximated as bicontinuous morphology. The low and medium q (q < 0.037 1/Å) scattering spectra of the SPTES 70 is due to the presence of fractal network of waters which have not coalesce yet.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The scattering spectra of the SPTES-80 copolymer are consistent with a bicontinuous two phase structure of irregular shapes with sulfonic groups as interfacial ionic region. The scattering experi-mental data of the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was compared with this model (q > 0.015 1/Å), (Fig. 4c and Table 2). The periodicity of the water domains (or hydrophobic domains), d, predicted by this model is w54 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima (qmax), 56.7 Å. This value is the distance between water domains. The correlation length (x) obtained from this model is 37.86 Å which is a measure of dispersion.', 'The distance between the water phases, periodicity, was decreased from 59.9 Å to 54 Å with increasing degree of sulfona-tion. The correlation length, x, was increased from 31.14 Å to 37.86 Å when the degree of sulfonation increased. Increasing the interfacial area results in an increase in the x/d ratio. The presence of the upturn in the low range of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 at 55 �C (Fig. 4b and c) is attributed to the fractal morphology of the large scale features.', '3.3. Discussions', 'Scattering data of series of SPTES membranes were obtained in the full hydration state with increasing the sulfonation degree in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. Complete study was performed to provide understanding membranes morphology with increasing the temperature of the hydrated membranes from 25 �C to 55 �C. Proposed model assumes spherical nanodomains containing water molecules forming from clustering of the sulfonation groups. This assumption was performed based on previously reported study which showed spherical nanodomains in the dry SPTES 50 membrane under HR-TEM [29]. The scattering spectra of the membranes with high degree of sulfonation (SPTES 70, and 80) changed significantly when the temperature increased to 55 �C. The morphology is approximated as bi-continuous system where the hydrocarbon is the main support network containing water. This model has been recently proposed by Wnek et al. [40], Gebel [8], and Kreuer [12], Wnek also provided visualization of the hydro-phobic cluster using SYBYL version 6.7 (Tripos) and HINT (Hydro-pathicINTeractions)computationalmodelingsoftware[40]. Despite the support of the transport studies of this model [42],there is no direct visualization method for this proposed approxi-mation. The T. S. model is also supported by high proton conduc-tivity of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 membranes at 55 �C where a larger number of hydronium ions in a larger domain can facilitate proton transport. A summary of the structural evolution of the SPTES membranes as a function of temperature and degree of sulfonation is illustrated in Table 3. This study attempted to study a full range of SPTES membrane nanostructure for the first time and provide an understanding of large membrane water uptakes, and their morphology and their relation with high conductivity of the membranes using both liquid like ordering of polydisperse nano-spheres and bi-continuous T.S. model approximation.', '@', '@', 'Table 3 Summary of membrane structural changes (SPTES 50, 60, 70, and 80 at 25 �C, and SPTES 50 and 60 at 55 �C) as a function of degree of sulfonation and temperature by polydisperse hard sphere model with liquid-like ordering ordering). T.S. bi-continuous model was approximated for higher sulfonation degree copolymers, SPTES 70 and 80, at 55 �C.', '@', '4. Conclusions', 'A series of SPTES copolymers with high proton conductivity of 100e215 mS/cm at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity as potential fuel cells membranes were studied. SANS studies of fully hydrated membranes showed that the nanostructure of the fully hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C in agreement with ionic aggregates containing water molecules with a large scale morphology network of water pockets morphology. This model predicted that the increase in the degree of sulfonation resulted in an increase in the radius of ionic domains and an increase in the volume packing density of water in the aggregates. It was assumed that the same morphology of polydisperse correlated spherical ionic domains were present in the SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymers when the temperature increased to 55 �C. Increase in the degree of sulfonation for fully hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer at 55 �C led to a substantial reorganization of the membrane morphology which was described by a bi-continuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic network.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to thank the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Nano-structured andBiological Materials Branch forfunding this research.

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25�C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 �C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 �10�4 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 �0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 �C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 �C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by significant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of �4 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers.', '�2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through protonexchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Nafion�as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18].', 'Transport properties and nanostructure of sulfonated polyimide (SPI) membranes have been studied using pulsed field gradient NMR and NMR quadrupolar relaxation rates determinations [19,20], and small angle scattering methods (SAXS and SANS), respectively [21,22].', 'The microstructure of sulfonated polyetherether ketone (sPEEK) has been investigated by SAXS [12]. We recently reported a class of ionomers based on aromatic hydrocarbon copolymers with high proton conductivity and excellent thermal mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states [22e29]. Sulfonated poly-arylenethioethersulfone(SPTES)copolymershavefollowing chemical structures (Fig. 1).', 'SPTES copolymers including SPTES-50, SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80, have equivalent weight (EW) and IEC (mequiv./g) values of 610, 515, 459, 417, and 1.64, 1.94, 2.18, and 2.4, respectively [22]. They exhibited proton conductivity of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm respectively, at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity [22]. Their excellent proton conductivity at high temperatures combined with their high glass transition temperature (w200 �C) and mechanical stability (both in the dry and hydrated states) make them excellent potentials as high temperature PEM materials for fuel cells. SPTES-50 copolymer membrane has successfully been fabricated to membrane electrode assemblies and exhibited polarization curves and durability up to 400 h [29]. Their successful operations at 90e100 �C were limited by boiling point of water (100 �C at 1 atm). Replacing water molecules with heterocycles such as imidazolium where the charge carrier has a very low vapor pressure can result in proton conductivity at higher temperatures. Despite excellent electrochemical properties, excessive water uptake of SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes provide difficulties to be made as membrane electrode assembly [22,27] The proton transport and performance of SPTES copolymers highly depend on the presence of water molecules. In addition to the number of sulfonic groups, their acidity (pKa) ability to dissociate water molecules to proton, water activity coefficient, and number of water molecules associated with each sulfonic group, the supermolecular structure of the hydro-phobic and hydrophilic phases is also defined by polymer chain characteristics such as chain persistent length, and presence of sulfonic group on the backbone or in the side chains. We reported the presence of ionic nanodomains containing water molecules in the SPTES-70 using in-situ x-ray scattering [27]. The morphology and the nanostructure of SPTES-50 were approximated by corre-lated polydisperse spherical aggregates and a larger scale water domain network and were quantified by modeling of the SANS spectra with polydisperse hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [29]. This study reports the nanostructure and morphology of sulfonated polyarylenethioethersulfone (SPTES) copolymer membranes which is directly related to the proton transport through the membrane in terms of their degree of sulfonation and temperature dependency.', '2. Materials and methods', '2.1. Materials', 'Visually observed defect free films of SPTES copolymers were prepared by dissolving the purified copolymer in dimethyl acet-amide (DMAc, Sigma Aldrich) (5e10 wt%) filtering, placing in a flat dish in a vacuum oven with a gradual temperature rise to 100 �C for 24 h and 120 �C for 2 h. The resulting uniform flat films were immersed for 2 h in deionized water and dried under vacuum (24 h, 80 �C) after they were acidified in sulfuric acid (4 M, 24 h) to ensure complete conversion of sulfonic groups to their protonated forms.', '2.2. Characterization', 'SANS experiments were performed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Neutron Center for Research using 30 m NG-7 SANS instrument with a neutron wavelength, l, of 6 Å (Dl/l ¼ 10%) and three sample-to-detector distance of 1.5 m, 10 m (l ¼ 6 Å), and 15 m (l ¼ 8 Å), 0.001 < q < 0.3168 Å�1 at 25, and 55 �C (accuracy of 0.5 �C). Hydrated membranes were placed in demountable 1 mm thick titanium liquid cells filled with D2O after equilibrium in D2O (24 h). Scattered intensities were reduced, corrected for the transmission and background and placed on absolute scale. Then, circularly averaged to produce absolute scale scattering intensity, I(q), as a function of the wave vector, q, where q ¼ (4p/l)sin(q/2) and q is the scattering angle. Calculations were performed using Igor Pro�software [30,31]. USANS experiments covered a q-range of 0.00005 < q (Å�1) < 0.01, corresponding to a real-space length scale of 0.1 microne10 micron.', '3. Results and discussions', '3.1. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 25 �C', 'SPTES copolymers have high proton conductivity at high relative humidities and elevated temperatures; e.g. 65 �C and 85% RH of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers, respectively [27]. The degree of sulfonation increases for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6%, respectively. SPTES-50 copolymer has the lowest the degree of sulfonation and SPTES-80 copolymer has the highest degree of sulfonation in this class of copolymers [22,27]. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers at 25 �C show a scattering behavior of a two phase structure (Fig. 2a). The contribution of sulfonic groups to the scattering is considered to be negligible due to their small volume compared to the polymer and the water phase volume. It was visually observed that membranes do not dissociate when fully hydrated in the examined temperature. It was also determined by weight measurement that the membranes maintain the weight after deswelling. Therefore, the hydrophobic polymeric structure is the supporting network even at high water content and increased temperatures. Fig. 2a presents enhanced scattering intensity data (vertically shifted) for the hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copol-ymer membranes in the order of 20X, 1000X, and 2 �105X for the clarity of data presentation. The absolute scale scattering intensities in the medium q range of 0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1 are almost in the same intensity range for all SPTES copolymers. The high q scattering spectra for all copolymers exhibit a feature which is attributed to the presence of ionic domains containing water molecules. According to the scattering results, the morphology of all hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C can be approximated as correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates with liquid-like ordering (P.Y. ordering) and a power law decay [29]. The scattering data for the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C were compared and quantified using polydisperse (Schulz polydispersity) hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [32e34] and a low q power law decay [29]. The modeling of the SPETS 50 nanostructure and its properties have been reported elsewhere but presented here forclarity and completeness of the SPTES series analysis [29]. Fig. 2b shows the experimental scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 25 �C compared with the theoretical calculations of the model (solid line). The results of the comparison of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes scattering data with the model are summarized in Table 1. According to this modeling the domain radius increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 13.45,14.9,15.4, and 16.9 Å for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes. The hard sphere packing density increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 19.8%, 23%, 25%, 29% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. This could indicate that ionic domains are capable of holding more water molecules with the presence of more sulfonic groups on the polymer backbone (increasing the degree of sulfonation). The high-q scattering spectra exhibits onset of a peak formation when the degree of sulfonation was increased to 71.6% for SPTES-80 copolymer. Pres-ence of scattering maxima can be due to the scattering from an ordered structure (periodicity) or the oscillations resulted from the structural factor effects or the excluded volume effect arising from short range liquid-like ordering. The onset of peak formation is attributed to the excluded volume effects related to the liquid-like ordering [33e35]. The low-q power law decay of nearly �3 was observed for all SPTES copolymers in the range of 1 �10�4 < q (1/ Å) < 3 �10�3. The power law decay of �3 is attributed to the presence of interacting three-dimensional fractal morphology. In addition, a Guinier plateau [35] was present for the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer at the very low q (q (1/Å) < 9 �10�5). This is in addition to the nearly identical scattering intensity in the inter-mediate q-range (0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1). It can be concluded that the change in the degree of sulfonation had little or no effect on the intermediate and low angle scattering wave vector. The low-q power law decay was nearly �3 �0.1 for all SPTES copolymers. The presence of sharp interface between hydrophobic and hydro-philic domains was deduced from the power law decay of �4 at large angle wave vectors for all hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes. All scattering data presented in Fig. 2a shows a power slope of �3.85 to �4.15 which is approximated as w �4. The presence of Porod behavior (decay of �4) has been attributed to the two immiscible phase with a sharp boundary [35e37]. This shows that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are separated with a distinct interface containing sulfonic groups.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Presence of a plateau in the scattering spectra is characteristics of isolated scatterers [35]. The radius of gyration (Rg) of the isolated scatterers can be approximated by IðqÞ ¼ I0expðð�q2R2gÞ=3Þ, where I0 is the extrapolated zero scattering intensity (Guinier approxi-mation) [35]. Presence of the Guinier plateau in the q range of 4.3 �10�5 < q (1/Å) < 8.2 �10�5 for SPTES-80 copolymer suggests segregation of the isolated large scale hydrophilic water pockets when the degree of sulfonation increased to 71.6%. Radius of gyration of the isolated larger scale water pockets in fully hydratedSPTES-80 copolymer membrane was 1.3 �0.18 micron which was calculated from this approximation (Fig. 2c).', '@', '@', '3.2. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 55 �C', 'Based on the physical observations, water saturated membranes at 55 �C were swollen films without visual dissociation. Fig. 3 exhibits the scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. The inter-mediate scattering intensity decreased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes start to form scattering maxima at high q range when the degree of sulfonation increased. This indicated the increase in the excluded volume due to the increase in the volume of the scatterers at higher degree of sulfonation and increased temperature (55 �C). The presence of scattering maxima is more significant for SPTES-70 copolymer and SPTES-80 copolymer with 63.3 and 71.6% degree of sulfonation. The large angle scattering feature shows scattering maxima at qmax of 0.103 and 0.1108 1/Å for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers which correspond to spatial characteristics lengths (l ¼ 2p/qmax) of 60.97 and 56.7 Å due to concentration fluctuations of hydrated domains (hard spheres). The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes changed significantlywith increasing degree of sulfonation. This indicates a substantial change in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology with increasing degree of sulfonation at 55 �C which is more pronounced for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers (degree of sulfonation 63.3 and 71.6%, respectively). Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are segregated distinctly by the sulfonic groups at the interface which is repre-sented by the Porod behavior, asymptotic behavior of w �4 for all SPTES copolymers [35e37]. The morphology of these membranes is complex and controlled by interfacial phenomena. The number of sulfonic groups per repeat unit volume and their acidity com-plemented with the chain persistent length and chain mobility are governing factors in the formed morphology. This study approxi-mates the morphology of the fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55 �C are approximated as spherical nanodomains containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering similar to their morphology at 25 �C. It is also proposed that this morphology changedtofractalmorphologywithincreasing temperature (increasing the intermediate scattering decay). The domain radius and the sphere packing density were increased from 26.4 Å and 28% for SPTES-50 copolymer to 32 Å and 33% for SPTES-60copolymerwhiletheintermediatescatteringintensity decreased. The domain radius and packing density of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane increased from 13.45 Å and 19.8% to 26.4 Å and 28% when the temperature increased from 25 �C to 55 �C with this approximation. The same increasing trend of 14.9 Åe32 Å for the average domain radius and 23%e33% of the sphere packing density was observed. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane compared to the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane is attributed to the disruption of the large scale morphology. The low q power law decay of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane was close to the decay of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane.', 'The increase in the degree of sulfonation of SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymers from 54.9, to 63.3 and 71.6% resulted in a shift in the position of the high q scattering maxima of the hydrated membranes toward the large angle scattering regime. This peak formation is more prominent for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copoly-mers with higher sulfonation degree. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering intensity in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70 and-80 copolymers is attributed to the loss of the large scale water network, intermediate fractal morphology within the polymer and onset of a morphology change to a two large scale phase morphology. The closed domain morphology of polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with fractal network were present for fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55�C (Figs. 3 and 4a). However, substantialchangesinthemorphologyoffullyhydrated membranes occurred when the degree of sulfonation is increased to 63.3 and 71.6% for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers at higher temperature of 55 �C. Combination of high temperature, high density of sulfonic groups, and significant amount of water mole-cules within the polymer backbone could have resulted in the coalescence of the small spherical ionic domains and fractal water network into a larger scale bicontinuous network of intermeshed hydrophobic and hydrophilic morphology for fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane at 55 �C. The bicontinuous model origi-nally proposed for micro-emulsion of two immiscible phases of water and oil with comparable amount based on Landau theory [38,39]. This model describes two irregular shapes with distinct boundary and has been used for intermesh of hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure when the particle shape is not well-defined [40,41]. This model proposes I(q) ¼ (a2þc1q þ c2q2)�1 for a2 > 0, c1 < 0, and c2 > 0, a single broad scattering maxima, and power law decay of �4 at large scattering angles. Two characteristics lengths of d and x are deduced from this analysis having a2, c1, and c2[39,40], d is the domain periodicity or interdomain distance and x is the correlation length which has been attributed to the dispersion of d. According to this theory, c1 is negative due to the surfactant. The absolute values of c1 and the ratio of x/d should increase with increasing surfactant. The specific internal surface area can be derived from the ratio of S/V ¼ 44(1�4)/x [38,39].', 'The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane has a low-q upturn, a lower intermediate scattering intensity compared to the hydrated SPTES-60 and SPTES-50 copolymers, and a large angle maxima followed by a power law decay of �4. This indicates the onset of the coalescence of the ionic aggregates, disruption of the fractal water network, and the formation of the two irregular large scale bicontinuous phase morphology. The high q range (q > 0.037 1/Å) of the scatteringspectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 55 �C was compared with the T.S. bicontinuous model (Fig. 4b). This simulation resulted in a periodicity, d, of 59.9 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima position, 60.97 Å. According to this simulation, the correlation length (x) is 31.14 Å. The medium-q range scattering still exhibits the larger scale morphology which is not completely converted to the bi-continuous phase morphology. However, they are partially collapsed characterized by a lower scattering intensity in the intermediate q range. The high q maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 is approximated as bicontinuous morphology. The low and medium q (q < 0.037 1/Å) scattering spectra of the SPTES 70 is due to the presence of fractal network of waters which have not coalesce yet.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The scattering spectra of the SPTES-80 copolymer are consistent with a bicontinuous two phase structure of irregular shapes with sulfonic groups as interfacial ionic region. The scattering experi-mental data of the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was compared with this model (q > 0.015 1/Å), (Fig. 4c and Table 2). The periodicity of the water domains (or hydrophobic domains), d, predicted by this model is w54 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima (qmax), 56.7 Å. This value is the distance between water domains. The correlation length (x) obtained from this model is 37.86 Å which is a measure of dispersion.', 'The distance between the water phases, periodicity, was decreased from 59.9 Å to 54 Å with increasing degree of sulfona-tion. The correlation length, x, was increased from 31.14 Å to 37.86 Å when the degree of sulfonation increased. Increasing the interfacial area results in an increase in the x/d ratio. The presence of the upturn in the low range of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 at 55 �C (Fig. 4b and c) is attributed to the fractal morphology of the large scale features.', '3.3. Discussions', 'Scattering data of series of SPTES membranes were obtained in the full hydration state with increasing the sulfonation degree in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. Complete study was performed to provide understanding membranes morphology with increasing the temperature of the hydrated membranes from 25 �C to 55 �C. Proposed model assumes spherical nanodomains containing water molecules forming from clustering of the sulfonation groups. This assumption was performed based on previously reported study which showed spherical nanodomains in the dry SPTES 50 membrane under HR-TEM [29]. The scattering spectra of the membranes with high degree of sulfonation (SPTES 70, and 80) changed significantly when the temperature increased to 55 �C. The morphology is approximated as bi-continuous system where the hydrocarbon is the main support network containing water. This model has been recently proposed by Wnek et al. [40], Gebel [8], and Kreuer [12], Wnek also provided visualization of the hydro-phobic cluster using SYBYL version 6.7 (Tripos) and HINT (Hydro-pathicINTeractions)computationalmodelingsoftware[40]. Despite the support of the transport studies of this model [42],there is no direct visualization method for this proposed approxi-mation. The T. S. model is also supported by high proton conduc-tivity of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 membranes at 55 �C where a larger number of hydronium ions in a larger domain can facilitate proton transport. A summary of the structural evolution of the SPTES membranes as a function of temperature and degree of sulfonation is illustrated in Table 3. This study attempted to study a full range of SPTES membrane nanostructure for the first time and provide an understanding of large membrane water uptakes, and their morphology and their relation with high conductivity of the membranes using both liquid like ordering of polydisperse nano-spheres and bi-continuous T.S. model approximation.', '@', '@', 'Table 3 Summary of membrane structural changes (SPTES 50, 60, 70, and 80 at 25 �C, and SPTES 50 and 60 at 55 �C) as a function of degree of sulfonation and temperature by polydisperse hard sphere model with liquid-like ordering ordering). T.S. bi-continuous model was approximated for higher sulfonation degree copolymers, SPTES 70 and 80, at 55 �C.', '@', '4. Conclusions', 'A series of SPTES copolymers with high proton conductivity of 100e215 mS/cm at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity as potential fuel cells membranes were studied. SANS studies of fully hydrated membranes showed that the nanostructure of the fully hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C in agreement with ionic aggregates containing water molecules with a large scale morphology network of water pockets morphology. This model predicted that the increase in the degree of sulfonation resulted in an increase in the radius of ionic domains and an increase in the volume packing density of water in the aggregates. It was assumed that the same morphology of polydisperse correlated spherical ionic domains were present in the SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymers when the temperature increased to 55 �C. Increase in the degree of sulfonation for fully hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer at 55 �C led to a substantial reorganization of the membrane morphology which was described by a bi-continuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic network.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to thank the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Nano-structured andBiological Materials Branch forfunding this research.

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25�C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 �C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 �10�4 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 �0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 �C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 �C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by significant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of �4 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers.', '�2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through protonexchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Nafion�as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18].', 'Transport properties and nanostructure of sulfonated polyimide (SPI) membranes have been studied using pulsed field gradient NMR and NMR quadrupolar relaxation rates determinations [19,20], and small angle scattering methods (SAXS and SANS), respectively [21,22].', 'The microstructure of sulfonated polyetherether ketone (sPEEK) has been investigated by SAXS [12]. We recently reported a class of ionomers based on aromatic hydrocarbon copolymers with high proton conductivity and excellent thermal mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states [22e29]. Sulfonated poly-arylenethioethersulfone(SPTES)copolymershavefollowing chemical structures (Fig. 1).', 'SPTES copolymers including SPTES-50, SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80, have equivalent weight (EW) and IEC (mequiv./g) values of 610, 515, 459, 417, and 1.64, 1.94, 2.18, and 2.4, respectively [22]. They exhibited proton conductivity of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm respectively, at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity [22]. Their excellent proton conductivity at high temperatures combined with their high glass transition temperature (w200 �C) and mechanical stability (both in the dry and hydrated states) make them excellent potentials as high temperature PEM materials for fuel cells. SPTES-50 copolymer membrane has successfully been fabricated to membrane electrode assemblies and exhibited polarization curves and durability up to 400 h [29]. Their successful operations at 90e100 �C were limited by boiling point of water (100 �C at 1 atm). Replacing water molecules with heterocycles such as imidazolium where the charge carrier has a very low vapor pressure can result in proton conductivity at higher temperatures. Despite excellent electrochemical properties, excessive water uptake of SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes provide difficulties to be made as membrane electrode assembly [22,27] The proton transport and performance of SPTES copolymers highly depend on the presence of water molecules. In addition to the number of sulfonic groups, their acidity (pKa) ability to dissociate water molecules to proton, water activity coefficient, and number of water molecules associated with each sulfonic group, the supermolecular structure of the hydro-phobic and hydrophilic phases is also defined by polymer chain characteristics such as chain persistent length, and presence of sulfonic group on the backbone or in the side chains. We reported the presence of ionic nanodomains containing water molecules in the SPTES-70 using in-situ x-ray scattering [27]. The morphology and the nanostructure of SPTES-50 were approximated by corre-lated polydisperse spherical aggregates and a larger scale water domain network and were quantified by modeling of the SANS spectra with polydisperse hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [29]. This study reports the nanostructure and morphology of sulfonated polyarylenethioethersulfone (SPTES) copolymer membranes which is directly related to the proton transport through the membrane in terms of their degree of sulfonation and temperature dependency.', '2. Materials and methods', '2.1. Materials', 'Visually observed defect free films of SPTES copolymers were prepared by dissolving the purified copolymer in dimethyl acet-amide (DMAc, Sigma Aldrich) (5e10 wt%) filtering, placing in a flat dish in a vacuum oven with a gradual temperature rise to 100 �C for 24 h and 120 �C for 2 h. The resulting uniform flat films were immersed for 2 h in deionized water and dried under vacuum (24 h, 80 �C) after they were acidified in sulfuric acid (4 M, 24 h) to ensure complete conversion of sulfonic groups to their protonated forms.', '2.2. Characterization', 'SANS experiments were performed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Neutron Center for Research using 30 m NG-7 SANS instrument with a neutron wavelength, l, of 6 Å (Dl/l ¼ 10%) and three sample-to-detector distance of 1.5 m, 10 m (l ¼ 6 Å), and 15 m (l ¼ 8 Å), 0.001 < q < 0.3168 Å�1 at 25, and 55 �C (accuracy of 0.5 �C). Hydrated membranes were placed in demountable 1 mm thick titanium liquid cells filled with D2O after equilibrium in D2O (24 h). Scattered intensities were reduced, corrected for the transmission and background and placed on absolute scale. Then, circularly averaged to produce absolute scale scattering intensity, I(q), as a function of the wave vector, q, where q ¼ (4p/l)sin(q/2) and q is the scattering angle. Calculations were performed using Igor Pro�software [30,31]. USANS experiments covered a q-range of 0.00005 < q (Å�1) < 0.01, corresponding to a real-space length scale of 0.1 microne10 micron.', '3. Results and discussions', '3.1. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 25 �C', 'SPTES copolymers have high proton conductivity at high relative humidities and elevated temperatures; e.g. 65 �C and 85% RH of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers, respectively [27]. The degree of sulfonation increases for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6%, respectively. SPTES-50 copolymer has the lowest the degree of sulfonation and SPTES-80 copolymer has the highest degree of sulfonation in this class of copolymers [22,27]. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers at 25 �C show a scattering behavior of a two phase structure (Fig. 2a). The contribution of sulfonic groups to the scattering is considered to be negligible due to their small volume compared to the polymer and the water phase volume. It was visually observed that membranes do not dissociate when fully hydrated in the examined temperature. It was also determined by weight measurement that the membranes maintain the weight after deswelling. Therefore, the hydrophobic polymeric structure is the supporting network even at high water content and increased temperatures. Fig. 2a presents enhanced scattering intensity data (vertically shifted) for the hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copol-ymer membranes in the order of 20X, 1000X, and 2 �105X for the clarity of data presentation. The absolute scale scattering intensities in the medium q range of 0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1 are almost in the same intensity range for all SPTES copolymers. The high q scattering spectra for all copolymers exhibit a feature which is attributed to the presence of ionic domains containing water molecules. According to the scattering results, the morphology of all hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C can be approximated as correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates with liquid-like ordering (P.Y. ordering) and a power law decay [29]. The scattering data for the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C were compared and quantified using polydisperse (Schulz polydispersity) hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [32e34] and a low q power law decay [29]. The modeling of the SPETS 50 nanostructure and its properties have been reported elsewhere but presented here forclarity and completeness of the SPTES series analysis [29]. Fig. 2b shows the experimental scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 25 �C compared with the theoretical calculations of the model (solid line). The results of the comparison of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes scattering data with the model are summarized in Table 1. According to this modeling the domain radius increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 13.45,14.9,15.4, and 16.9 Å for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes. The hard sphere packing density increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 19.8%, 23%, 25%, 29% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. This could indicate that ionic domains are capable of holding more water molecules with the presence of more sulfonic groups on the polymer backbone (increasing the degree of sulfonation). The high-q scattering spectra exhibits onset of a peak formation when the degree of sulfonation was increased to 71.6% for SPTES-80 copolymer. Pres-ence of scattering maxima can be due to the scattering from an ordered structure (periodicity) or the oscillations resulted from the structural factor effects or the excluded volume effect arising from short range liquid-like ordering. The onset of peak formation is attributed to the excluded volume effects related to the liquid-like ordering [33e35]. The low-q power law decay of nearly �3 was observed for all SPTES copolymers in the range of 1 �10�4 < q (1/ Å) < 3 �10�3. The power law decay of �3 is attributed to the presence of interacting three-dimensional fractal morphology. In addition, a Guinier plateau [35] was present for the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer at the very low q (q (1/Å) < 9 �10�5). This is in addition to the nearly identical scattering intensity in the inter-mediate q-range (0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1). It can be concluded that the change in the degree of sulfonation had little or no effect on the intermediate and low angle scattering wave vector. The low-q power law decay was nearly �3 �0.1 for all SPTES copolymers. The presence of sharp interface between hydrophobic and hydro-philic domains was deduced from the power law decay of �4 at large angle wave vectors for all hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes. All scattering data presented in Fig. 2a shows a power slope of �3.85 to �4.15 which is approximated as w �4. The presence of Porod behavior (decay of �4) has been attributed to the two immiscible phase with a sharp boundary [35e37]. This shows that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are separated with a distinct interface containing sulfonic groups.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Presence of a plateau in the scattering spectra is characteristics of isolated scatterers [35]. The radius of gyration (Rg) of the isolated scatterers can be approximated by IðqÞ ¼ I0expðð�q2R2gÞ=3Þ, where I0 is the extrapolated zero scattering intensity (Guinier approxi-mation) [35]. Presence of the Guinier plateau in the q range of 4.3 �10�5 < q (1/Å) < 8.2 �10�5 for SPTES-80 copolymer suggests segregation of the isolated large scale hydrophilic water pockets when the degree of sulfonation increased to 71.6%. Radius of gyration of the isolated larger scale water pockets in fully hydratedSPTES-80 copolymer membrane was 1.3 �0.18 micron which was calculated from this approximation (Fig. 2c).', '@', '@', '3.2. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 55 �C', 'Based on the physical observations, water saturated membranes at 55 �C were swollen films without visual dissociation. Fig. 3 exhibits the scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. The inter-mediate scattering intensity decreased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes start to form scattering maxima at high q range when the degree of sulfonation increased. This indicated the increase in the excluded volume due to the increase in the volume of the scatterers at higher degree of sulfonation and increased temperature (55 �C). The presence of scattering maxima is more significant for SPTES-70 copolymer and SPTES-80 copolymer with 63.3 and 71.6% degree of sulfonation. The large angle scattering feature shows scattering maxima at qmax of 0.103 and 0.1108 1/Å for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers which correspond to spatial characteristics lengths (l ¼ 2p/qmax) of 60.97 and 56.7 Å due to concentration fluctuations of hydrated domains (hard spheres). The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes changed significantlywith increasing degree of sulfonation. This indicates a substantial change in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology with increasing degree of sulfonation at 55 �C which is more pronounced for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers (degree of sulfonation 63.3 and 71.6%, respectively). Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are segregated distinctly by the sulfonic groups at the interface which is repre-sented by the Porod behavior, asymptotic behavior of w �4 for all SPTES copolymers [35e37]. The morphology of these membranes is complex and controlled by interfacial phenomena. The number of sulfonic groups per repeat unit volume and their acidity com-plemented with the chain persistent length and chain mobility are governing factors in the formed morphology. This study approxi-mates the morphology of the fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55 �C are approximated as spherical nanodomains containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering similar to their morphology at 25 �C. It is also proposed that this morphology changedtofractalmorphologywithincreasing temperature (increasing the intermediate scattering decay). The domain radius and the sphere packing density were increased from 26.4 Å and 28% for SPTES-50 copolymer to 32 Å and 33% for SPTES-60copolymerwhiletheintermediatescatteringintensity decreased. The domain radius and packing density of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane increased from 13.45 Å and 19.8% to 26.4 Å and 28% when the temperature increased from 25 �C to 55 �C with this approximation. The same increasing trend of 14.9 Åe32 Å for the average domain radius and 23%e33% of the sphere packing density was observed. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane compared to the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane is attributed to the disruption of the large scale morphology. The low q power law decay of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane was close to the decay of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane.', 'The increase in the degree of sulfonation of SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymers from 54.9, to 63.3 and 71.6% resulted in a shift in the position of the high q scattering maxima of the hydrated membranes toward the large angle scattering regime. This peak formation is more prominent for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copoly-mers with higher sulfonation degree. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering intensity in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70 and-80 copolymers is attributed to the loss of the large scale water network, intermediate fractal morphology within the polymer and onset of a morphology change to a two large scale phase morphology. The closed domain morphology of polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with fractal network were present for fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55�C (Figs. 3 and 4a). However, substantialchangesinthemorphologyoffullyhydrated membranes occurred when the degree of sulfonation is increased to 63.3 and 71.6% for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers at higher temperature of 55 �C. Combination of high temperature, high density of sulfonic groups, and significant amount of water mole-cules within the polymer backbone could have resulted in the coalescence of the small spherical ionic domains and fractal water network into a larger scale bicontinuous network of intermeshed hydrophobic and hydrophilic morphology for fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane at 55 �C. The bicontinuous model origi-nally proposed for micro-emulsion of two immiscible phases of water and oil with comparable amount based on Landau theory [38,39]. This model describes two irregular shapes with distinct boundary and has been used for intermesh of hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure when the particle shape is not well-defined [40,41]. This model proposes I(q) ¼ (a2þc1q þ c2q2)�1 for a2 > 0, c1 < 0, and c2 > 0, a single broad scattering maxima, and power law decay of �4 at large scattering angles. Two characteristics lengths of d and x are deduced from this analysis having a2, c1, and c2[39,40], d is the domain periodicity or interdomain distance and x is the correlation length which has been attributed to the dispersion of d. According to this theory, c1 is negative due to the surfactant. The absolute values of c1 and the ratio of x/d should increase with increasing surfactant. The specific internal surface area can be derived from the ratio of S/V ¼ 44(1�4)/x [38,39].', 'The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane has a low-q upturn, a lower intermediate scattering intensity compared to the hydrated SPTES-60 and SPTES-50 copolymers, and a large angle maxima followed by a power law decay of �4. This indicates the onset of the coalescence of the ionic aggregates, disruption of the fractal water network, and the formation of the two irregular large scale bicontinuous phase morphology. The high q range (q > 0.037 1/Å) of the scatteringspectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 55 �C was compared with the T.S. bicontinuous model (Fig. 4b). This simulation resulted in a periodicity, d, of 59.9 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima position, 60.97 Å. According to this simulation, the correlation length (x) is 31.14 Å. The medium-q range scattering still exhibits the larger scale morphology which is not completely converted to the bi-continuous phase morphology. However, they are partially collapsed characterized by a lower scattering intensity in the intermediate q range. The high q maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 is approximated as bicontinuous morphology. The low and medium q (q < 0.037 1/Å) scattering spectra of the SPTES 70 is due to the presence of fractal network of waters which have not coalesce yet.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The scattering spectra of the SPTES-80 copolymer are consistent with a bicontinuous two phase structure of irregular shapes with sulfonic groups as interfacial ionic region. The scattering experi-mental data of the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was compared with this model (q > 0.015 1/Å), (Fig. 4c and Table 2). The periodicity of the water domains (or hydrophobic domains), d, predicted by this model is w54 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima (qmax), 56.7 Å. This value is the distance between water domains. The correlation length (x) obtained from this model is 37.86 Å which is a measure of dispersion.', 'The distance between the water phases, periodicity, was decreased from 59.9 Å to 54 Å with increasing degree of sulfona-tion. The correlation length, x, was increased from 31.14 Å to 37.86 Å when the degree of sulfonation increased. Increasing the interfacial area results in an increase in the x/d ratio. The presence of the upturn in the low range of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 at 55 �C (Fig. 4b and c) is attributed to the fractal morphology of the large scale features.', '3.3. Discussions', 'Scattering data of series of SPTES membranes were obtained in the full hydration state with increasing the sulfonation degree in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. Complete study was performed to provide understanding membranes morphology with increasing the temperature of the hydrated membranes from 25 �C to 55 �C. Proposed model assumes spherical nanodomains containing water molecules forming from clustering of the sulfonation groups. This assumption was performed based on previously reported study which showed spherical nanodomains in the dry SPTES 50 membrane under HR-TEM [29]. The scattering spectra of the membranes with high degree of sulfonation (SPTES 70, and 80) changed significantly when the temperature increased to 55 �C. The morphology is approximated as bi-continuous system where the hydrocarbon is the main support network containing water. This model has been recently proposed by Wnek et al. [40], Gebel [8], and Kreuer [12], Wnek also provided visualization of the hydro-phobic cluster using SYBYL version 6.7 (Tripos) and HINT (Hydro-pathicINTeractions)computationalmodelingsoftware[40]. Despite the support of the transport studies of this model [42],there is no direct visualization method for this proposed approxi-mation. The T. S. model is also supported by high proton conduc-tivity of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 membranes at 55 �C where a larger number of hydronium ions in a larger domain can facilitate proton transport. A summary of the structural evolution of the SPTES membranes as a function of temperature and degree of sulfonation is illustrated in Table 3. This study attempted to study a full range of SPTES membrane nanostructure for the first time and provide an understanding of large membrane water uptakes, and their morphology and their relation with high conductivity of the membranes using both liquid like ordering of polydisperse nano-spheres and bi-continuous T.S. model approximation.', '@', '@', 'Table 3 Summary of membrane structural changes (SPTES 50, 60, 70, and 80 at 25 �C, and SPTES 50 and 60 at 55 �C) as a function of degree of sulfonation and temperature by polydisperse hard sphere model with liquid-like ordering ordering). T.S. bi-continuous model was approximated for higher sulfonation degree copolymers, SPTES 70 and 80, at 55 �C.', '@', '4. Conclusions', 'A series of SPTES copolymers with high proton conductivity of 100e215 mS/cm at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity as potential fuel cells membranes were studied. SANS studies of fully hydrated membranes showed that the nanostructure of the fully hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C in agreement with ionic aggregates containing water molecules with a large scale morphology network of water pockets morphology. This model predicted that the increase in the degree of sulfonation resulted in an increase in the radius of ionic domains and an increase in the volume packing density of water in the aggregates. It was assumed that the same morphology of polydisperse correlated spherical ionic domains were present in the SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymers when the temperature increased to 55 �C. Increase in the degree of sulfonation for fully hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer at 55 �C led to a substantial reorganization of the membrane morphology which was described by a bi-continuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic network.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to thank the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Nano-structured andBiological Materials Branch forfunding this research.
