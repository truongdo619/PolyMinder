2025-02-19 23:14:02 - WARNING: Abstract: We reported a chemical approach for the in-situ preparation of  conducting polyaniline (PANI)/Fe2O3 composite dispersions using dodecylbenzene  sulfonic (DBSA) acid both as dopant and surfactant. The PANI/Fe2O3 composite  dispersions were characterized by X-ray diffraction, UV-vis and FT-IR spectra and  conductivity measurement. The dispersions showed good stability and existed  without precipitate for at least half a year. The gas-sensing behavior of the  composite film to 100 ppm of NH3 was studied through monitoring the change of  the resistance.

2025-02-19 23:14:02 - WARNING: Recently, polymeric composites containing metal oxides have attracted a great deal  of attention from researchers because they frequently exhibit unexpected hybrid  properties synergistically derived from both components [1-4]. Meanwhile, they  exhibit interesting properties with many applications such as quantum electronic  devices, gas sensors, capacitors, conducting paints and rechargeable batteries [5-8].  Composites of polyaniline (PANI) have been widely studied in view of their unique  electrical, dielectrical, optical and optoelectrical properties in addition to their easy  preparation and excellent environmental stability [9-12]. However, the poor solubility  limits their application as conducting materials. To overcome this obstacle,  functionalized protonic acids such as dedecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) or  camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) have been used to dope PANI and the obtained  conducting products were soluble in many kinds of solvents [13-14].

But most of the composites were in powder state;  therefore, the processes to prepare film for application in devices are complicated. In  our experiment, we prepare the conducting PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions in  aqueous solution by one step, and the so-obtained PANI/Fe2O3 composite  dispersions can be directly used to prepare conducting films and hence make  different devices.

2025-02-19 23:14:02 - WARNING: As for the formation of the dispersions, we assumed that the Fe2O3 particles were  dispersed in water aqueous solution and it would act as ‘seed’ to induce the  polymerization of aniline. In our experiment, the Fe2O3 particles were homogeneously  dispersed in the reaction system because DBSA with hydrophilic group acted as  surfactant. Then the aniline monomer contacted with Fe2O3 nearly at the same time,  which could accelerate the induction time of polymerization [26]. This effect could be  observed by monitoring the change of the solution temperature as shown in Fig. 1.  From Fig. 1, we can see that the time for the seed polymerization to start was about  300 s (Fig. 1b) while without Fe2O3 particles was about 3300 s along (Fig. 1a).

2025-02-19 23:14:02 - WARNING: 1 is contributed to C-N stretching mode. The strong peak at 1459 cm-1 is related to  C=C stretching mode of the benzenoid ring and a weak peak of quionoid ring at 1548  cm-1 means the high doping degree of the PANI [29]. And from Fig. 4b, we can see  that when the Fe2O3 particles present in the dispersion, the intensity of the peak at  1459 cm-1 is decreased and shift to 1461 cm-1, which represents the decrease of  doping degree of the PANI. There may be some interaction between the lone pair  electrons of N atom in PANI chains with 3d orbit of Fe atom, which could reduce the  energy level interval of aromatic nucleus. This also caused the UV-vis absorption  band of composite dispersions to have a red shift [30].

A typical experiment was done as follows: 0.465 g of aniline was dispersed  into 100 ml of DBSA aqueous solution (0.2 M) under stirring, after which 0.1 g of  Fe2O3 was added into the above solution under ultrasonic. APS in powder state was  then added into the mixture solution. The dispersions of PANI/Fe2O3 composite were  obtained after stirring for 1 h. The PANI dispersions were prepared by the same  approach in absence of Fe2O3. Acetone damaging dispersions were centrifuged and  washed with distilled water, ethanol and acetone three times, respectively. The  resulting powder were dried under reduced pressure at room temperature and then  used for XRD and conductivity measurements.   Characterization

R.  China  2 Faculty of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130023, P. R.  China   ', '(Received: 21 May, 2007; published: 10 September, 2007)', 'Abstract: We reported a chemical approach for the in-situ preparation of  conducting polyaniline (PANI)/Fe2O3 composite dispersions using dodecylbenzene  sulfonic (DBSA) acid both as dopant and surfactant. The PANI/Fe2O3 composite  dispersions were characterized by X-ray diffraction, UV-vis and FT-IR spectra and  conductivity measurement. The dispersions showed good stability and existed  without precipitate for at least half a year. The gas-sensing behavior of the  composite film to 100 ppm of NH3 was studied through monitoring the change of  the resistance. Keywords: PANI/Fe2O3 composite, dispersions, dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid', 'Introduction', 'Recently, polymeric composites containing metal oxides have attracted a great deal  of attention from researchers because they frequently exhibit unexpected hybrid  properties synergistically derived from both components [1-4]. Meanwhile, they  exhibit interesting properties with many applications such as quantum electronic  devices, gas sensors, capacitors, conducting paints and rechargeable batteries [5-8].  Composites of polyaniline (PANI) have been widely studied in view of their unique  electrical, dielectrical, optical and optoelectrical properties in addition to their easy  preparation and excellent environmental stability [9-12]. However, the poor solubility  limits their application as conducting materials. To overcome this obstacle,  functionalized protonic acids such as dedecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) or  camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) have been used to dope PANI and the obtained  conducting products were soluble in many kinds of solvents [13-14].', 'On the other hand, composite of PANI and iron oxides (Fe2O3 or Fe3O4) has been  extensively investigated because of their unique magnetic properties and application  prospects in technology [15-24]. But most of the composites were in powder state;  therefore, the processes to prepare film for application in devices are complicated. In  our experiment, we prepare the conducting PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions in  aqueous solution by one step, and the so-obtained PANI/Fe2O3 composite  dispersions can be directly used to prepare conducting films and hence make  different devices.', 'In our former work, we have investigated the formation of the PANI dispersions under  different preparation conductions by changing the concentration of surfactant, aniline,  acid and the ratio of aniline to ammonium persulphate (APS) [25]. In this study, we', '1', 'chose the optimum conditions considering the above factors to prepare the  PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions by in-situ polymerization using DBSA both as  dopant and surfactant. The dispersions of PANI/Fe2O3 composite could exist without  any precipitate for at least half a year. In addition, it can be diluted by distilled water  for many times without generation of precipitate, indicating their high stability or  nearly solution characteristic. The structure and conductivity of the composite was  studied by X-ray, UV-vis and FT-IR spectra, and four-probe technology. The gas-sensing behavior of the film prepared by directly spinning the dispersions on silicon  chip was studied.  ', ' Results and discussion  Formation', 'As for the formation of the dispersions, we assumed that the Fe2O3 particles were  dispersed in water aqueous solution and it would act as ‘seed’ to induce the  polymerization of aniline. In our experiment, the Fe2O3 particles were homogeneously  dispersed in the reaction system because DBSA with hydrophilic group acted as  surfactant. Then the aniline monomer contacted with Fe2O3 nearly at the same time,  which could accelerate the induction time of polymerization [26]. This effect could be  observed by monitoring the change of the solution temperature as shown in Fig. 1.  From Fig. 1, we can see that the time for the seed polymerization to start was about  300 s (Fig. 1b) while without Fe2O3 particles was about 3300 s along (Fig. 1a).', 'Fig. 1. Temperature change during the induction time.', 'XRD pattern', 'The XRD pattern of PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions is shown in Fig. 2. In the  pattern, the 2θ at 35.6, 43.4, 53.6, 57.3, and 62.8 o are contributed to γ-Fe2O3, and  33.08, 40.78 and 49.42 o are related to α-Fe2O3. The broad peaks at about 19.9 and  24.1 o are characteristic peaks of PANI [27]. These results indicate that the', '2', 'PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions contain two different phases of the Fe2O3  particles, and the PANI is amorphous in the composite.', 'Fig. 2. XRD pattern of the PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions.   UV-vis spectra', 'Fig. 3. UV-vis spectra of PANI (a) and PANI/Fe2O3 composite (b) dispersions.  ', 'The UV-vis absorption spectra of PANI and the PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions  are shown in Fig. 3. A typical absorption spectrum of PANI dispersions has three', '3', 'distinct absorption peaks at 351, 436, and 757 nm, respectively (Fig. 3a). The peak  at 351 nm arises from π-π* electron transition within benzenoid segments, the peak  at 436 nm is due to the polaron state and the wide peak at 757 nm is related to the  doping level [28]. Compared to the PANI dispersions, the absorption peak of  PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions show little difference, for example, the peak at  757 nm shifts to 746 nm (Fig. 3b). The shift may be originated from the decreasing  doping level by the addition of Fe2O3.  FT-IR spectra', 'The FT-IR spectra of PANI and PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions are shown in Fig.  4. From Fig. 4a, we can find the characteristic peaks of PANI: the peak at 684 cm-1 is  usually assigned to the C-H out of plane bending in 1, 2 ring in intrinsic PANI; the  peak at 1083 cm-1 stands for the C-H aromatic in-plane bending on 1, 4 ring; the  peak at 1183 cm-1 may be assigned to the carbon skeleton, and the peak of 1311 cm-', '1 is contributed to C-N stretching mode. The strong peak at 1459 cm-1 is related to  C=C stretching mode of the benzenoid ring and a weak peak of quionoid ring at 1548  cm-1 means the high doping degree of the PANI [29]. And from Fig. 4b, we can see  that when the Fe2O3 particles present in the dispersion, the intensity of the peak at  1459 cm-1 is decreased and shift to 1461 cm-1, which represents the decrease of  doping degree of the PANI. There may be some interaction between the lone pair  electrons of N atom in PANI chains with 3d orbit of Fe atom, which could reduce the  energy level interval of aromatic nucleus. This also caused the UV-vis absorption  band of composite dispersions to have a red shift [30].', 'Fig. 4. FT-IR spectra of PANI (a) and PANI/Fe2O3 composite (b) dispersions.   Conductivity', 'Table 1 shows the conductivity values measured by using four-probe technology at  25 0C. Compared to pure PANI, the conductivity of PANI/Fe2O3 composite with Fe2O3  content of 0.05 g increases from 0.98 to 1.07μS/cm. This may be attributed to the  doping effect associated with Fe2O3 particles that are believed to help induce the  formation of a more efficient network for change transport, thus enhancing the', '4', 'conductivity of the composite [31]. However, with increasing the content of Fe2O3, the  relative contents of the conducting polymer are decreased, resulting in the decrease  of the corresponding conductivity. The decrease may be attributed to two factors: (a)  the insulating behavior of the Fe2O3 particles in the core of the composites; (b) a  decrease of doping degree as the UV-vis and FT-IR spectra show [32].

The response time of the composite film is 40 s. It can be applied to the detection of  ammonia, and the further study of the sensitivity to NH3 and other gases is under  way.', '5', 'Stability', 'The stability of the dispersions with different content of Fe2O3 particles was studied.  When the content of Fe2O3 particles in the dispersions was lower than 0.05 g, the  dispersions show good stability and existed without precipitate at least half a year.  However, when the content was beyond 0.05 g, there were some precipitates on the  bottom of the dispersion and the quantity of the precipitates increased with the  content of Fe2O3.  ', ' Conclusions', 'PANI/Fe2O3 dispersions were prepared using DBSA both as dopant and surfactant.  The XRD, UV-vis and FT-IR characterization indicated that there is some interaction  between the PANI and Fe2O3. The conductivity of the dispersions increased when a  little of Fe2O3 particles were added and decreased in line when a great quantity of  Fe2O3 were added. The dispersions showed good stability and existed without  precipitate for at least half a year. A film were prepared by directly spinning the  PANI/Fe2O3 dispersions on a chip of silicon to study the gas-sensing of100ppm NH3;  the response time is only 40 s and further study of the sensitivity to the NH3 is under  way.   ', ' Experimental  Materials', 'Aniline was freshly distilled under reduced pressure and other chemicals were used  as received without further purification. Fe2O3 particles were synthesized by  coprecipitation.   ', ' Preparation of PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersion', 'PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions were prepared using an in-situ polymerization  method. A typical experiment was done as follows: 0.465 g of aniline was dispersed  into 100 ml of DBSA aqueous solution (0.2 M) under stirring, after which 0.1 g of  Fe2O3 was added into the above solution under ultrasonic. APS in powder state was  then added into the mixture solution. The dispersions of PANI/Fe2O3 composite were  obtained after stirring for 1 h. The PANI dispersions were prepared by the same  approach in absence of Fe2O3. Acetone damaging dispersions were centrifuged and  washed with distilled water, ethanol and acetone three times, respectively. The  resulting powder were dried under reduced pressure at room temperature and then  used for XRD and conductivity measurements.

Moreover, the dilution condition should be applied to suppress the concurrent chain extension. In consequence, this bimolecular process is now', 'recognized as a less attractive choice for the preparation of cyclic polymers in practice (Scheme 1A). ', 'A significantly improved means by an alternative unimolecular process has subsequently been introduced to prepare cyclic polymers (Scheme 1B). It was first demonstrated by using an asymmetrically functional telechelic precursor, a-acetal-u-styryl polystyrene,7 and the subsequent end-to-end polymer cyclization through the deprotection/activation treatment. This unimolecular process with asymmetrically functional telechelic precursors has been extended by employing alternative pairs of the reactive groups. Thus, an a-amino-u-carboxyl polystyrene and poly(tert-butyl acrylate) were prepared through a living polymerization using an initiator having a protected amino group, followed by the end-capping reaction to introduce a carboxylic group.8 The resulting asymmetric telechelic precursor underwent, after the deprotection, an intramolecular amidation reaction to give a ring polymer product effectively. Alternatively, an a-(furan-pro-tected)-maleimide-u-cyclopentadienylpoly(methylmethacry-late) and poly(tert-butyl acrylate) were prepared through the ATRP using a protected maleimide initiator and the subsequent introduction of a cyclopentadienyl group at the living end with the nickelocene methodology.9 The obtained asymmetric tele-chelic precursor was subjected to the heat treatment to cause the spontaneous deprotection followed by an intramolecular Diels–Alder addition reaction to give a ring polymer product effectively.9 It is notable, however, that these processes using telechelic precursors having potentially reactive groups require multistep protection/deprotection treatments. ', 'A versatile unimolecular process has recently been introduced by employing a click reaction using asymmetrically functional telechelic polystyrene having an alkyne and an azide group.10 The introduction of these two functional groups at the polymer chain-ends could be performed conveniently, and they can react with each other upon the addition of a Cu catalyst.11 Therefore, this click polymer cyclization has been applied to prepare such functional ring polymers, as poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide)12,13', 'and poly(caprolactone)14 as well as poly(valerolactone)15 to elucidate their topology-effect on phase transition, and on biodegradation, respectively, detailed in the later section.

This process does not require dilution in contrast to the end-to-end polymer cyclization process by linear polymer precursors, while a reactive initiator fragment is inherently included in the final ring polymer structure. Thus until recently, the ring-expansion process has been considered as a less practical means, since it is not an easy task to maintain the ring topology of the product while eliminating the initiator residues.26', 'A number of new processes have recently been developed to address this problem in the ring-expansion polymerization (Scheme 2). Thus, a new Ru catalyst bearing a cyclic ligand containing the Ru-alkylidene unit has been introduced and applied for the ring-expansion polymerization of cyclic olefins such as 1,5-cyclooctadiene or cyclooctene.27 During the chain-growth process, the chain transfer to the Ru-alkylidene unit took place to eliminate the initiator complex, and consequently a ring polybutadiene or a ring poly(cyclooctene) free of the catalyst fragment, respectively, is produced.

It is remarkable, moreover, that a small portion of nanoobjects corresponding to complex ring polymers having tadpole, 8-shaped, catenated and knotted forms were also identified. This showed, for the first time, that not only single-cyclic but also various complex cyclic polymer topologies are indeed produced through the polymer cyclization process, as previously shown in DNA systems.37', 'An electrostatic self-assembly and covalent fixation (ESA-CF) process has been introduced for the effective synthesis of not only cyclic but also functionalized cyclic and multicyclic polymers, where linear or star telechelic polymers having cyclic ammonium salt groups accompanying small or polymeric plurifunctional carboxylate counteranions are employed as key precursors (Scheme 1E).38–40 Various telechelic polymers have been conve-niently prepared through the relevant living polymerization fol-lowed by the end-capping/end-conversion technique. The choice of such particular types of cyclic ammonium salt end groups as five- and six-membered cyclic ammonium, i.e., N-phenyl-pyrrolidinium and N-phenylpiperidinium salt groups, respec-tively, is of a crucial importance in the ESA-CF process (Scheme 3).41 The former undergoes upon heating a selective ring-opening reaction by a carboxylate counteranion to form an amino ester group through the nucleophilic attack exclusively at the N-adjacent ring (endo) position. On the other hand, the latter having unstrained six-membered cyclic ammonium salt groups gives a chemically more stable, simple ester group through the nucleophilic attack at the alternative N-adjacent (exo) position, to eliminate N-phenylpiperidine.

Thus, when a self-assembly comprised of', 'a linear telechelic precursor, typically poly(THF), having cyclic ammonium salt groups accompanying either a dicarboxylate or a tetracarboxylate counteranion was heated at dilution, the selective ring-opening reaction of the cyclic ammonium groups took place to produce single-cyclic (ring) or dicyclic (8-shaped) polymerproducts,respectively,inhighyields.38,42Ring poly(THF)s having the molecular weights of up to 10 000, cor-responding to the ring size of as high as 700 atoms, were obtainable and characterized unequivocally by the MALDI-TOF mass technique. Furthermore, the ESA-CF process with dynamic equilibrium nature has been exploited to construct various multicyclic as well as cyclic-linear hybrid polymer topologies (Scheme 5).6', 'Moreover, ring polymers possessing the prescribed functional groups at the designated positions, i.e., kyklo-telechelics and cyclic macromonomer, have also been prepared by employing telechelic precursors possessing such functional groups as hydroxyl, olefinic, acetylenic, and azide groups at the designated, typically a center, position by using the relevant initiator, or by introducing functional linking reagents.43 They were subse-quently applied to construct more complex polymer topologies either through the covalent linkage or even through the non-covalent, mechanical linkage uniquely formed by threading with ring polymer units.44,45 It was also shown that network polymers formed from cyclic polymer precursors exhibited unique gel properties compared with conventional gels obtained with linear/ branched polymer precursors.46 Moreover, the topological conversion of polymers between ring/linear and even between single-cyclic/dicyclic topologies has now been achieved.45,47,48', 'By the combination of the ESA-CF protocol with selective covalent linking chemistry, a wide variety of multi-cyclic as well as cyclic-linear conjugated polymers have been synthesized.49 In particular, the combination of the ESA-CF process with the metathesis condensation and with the click process has now been revealed as a versatile means to construct a variety of complex multicyclic polymer topologies of fused-, spiro- and bridged forms (Scheme 6).50 Both the functional ring polymer precursors and thecovalentlylinkedmulticyclicpolymerproductwere unequivocally characterized by means of a series of spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques including MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy and SEC.

On the contrary, the hydrodynamic volume or the melt viscosity of ring polymers is inherently smaller than their linear counterparts irrespective of their chain lengths. This indicates the distinctive conception in the topology effect by ring polymers. The latter is regarded as an inherent topology effect by ring polymers, while the former as the depletion effect of the polymer chain ends. Nevertheless, the elimination of the chain ends of polymer molecules inevitably leads to the formation of cyclic constructions to bring the topology effect, now drawing increasing interests to discover unusual properties and functions in polymer materials covering mechanical, thermal, electric, photonic and bio-related applica-tions either in bulk or at surface.
