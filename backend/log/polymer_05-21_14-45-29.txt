2025-05-21 14:45:58 - WARNING: ['Effect of polymer crystallinity on the spatial distribution of dopant in sequentially solution‑doped conjugated polymer thin films', 'Yongkyeong Lee1 · Seung Hyun Kim2 · Daegun Kim1 · Hansol Lee1', 'Received: 3 February 2025 / Revised: 23 April 2025 / Accepted: 28 April 2025  © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Polymer Society of Korea 2025', 'Abstract', 'Sequential solution doping is one of the most frequently used methods for doping conjugated polymer films. Since the spatial distribution of dopants in doped polymer films significantly influences their electrical properties, elucidating how various material parameters affect the dopant distribution in sequentially solution-doped polymer films is of great importance. This study investigates the effect of crystallinity in conjugated polymer thin films on the spatial distribution of dopants along the out-of-plane direction. The results show that higher crystallinity in polymer films leads to a more non-uniform dopant distribution, with a greater composition of dopants at the film surface compared to the bulk. This phenomenon is attributed to the crystallinity-dependent swellability of polymer films, where films with higher crystallinity exhibit lower swellability, resulting in less efficient dopant diffusion from the surface to the bulk compared to films with lower crystallinity.', 'Graphic abstract', 'This study explores how crystallinity in conjugated polymer thin films affects dopant distribution during sequential solution doping, revealing that higher crystallinity results in a more nonuniform distribution, with greater dopant compositions at the surface than in the bulk. This is due to lower swellability, which limits effective dopant diffusion from the surface to the bulk.', '@', 'Keywords Chemical doping · Conjugated polymers · Molecular dopants · Crystallinity · Sequential solution doping', '1 Introduction', 'Conjugated polymers have garnered significant attention in the field of organic electronics due to their unique optoelectronic properties [1–10]. One promising approach to enhance the performance of conjugated polymers is through doping, particularly in the field of polymer electrodes and organic thermoelectrics [3, 7, 11–16]. Doping involves introducing additional molecules into a polymer film to control the charge carrier concentration via charge transfer between them, resulting in changes to the polymer’s optical and electrical properties, such as electrical conductivity, Fermi level, and light absorption coefficients in visible and near-infrared ranges [17–19]. The development of efficient dopants and doping methods, along with a concrete understanding of the underlying principles, is essential for improving the performance of doped conjugated polymers in various applications.', 'Two commonly employed solution-based doping techniques used in the doping of conjugated polymers are mixed-solution doping and sequential solution doping. Mixed-solution doping of a conjugated polymer involves the blending of the polymer and dopant in one solution, followed by the deposition of the blend solution to obtain a doped polymer film [3]. Although this method is advantageous for the precise control of the ratio between the polymer and dopant, it often suffers from severe aggregation of charged polymers within the solution and poor quality of the resulting polymer films [20]. On the other hand, sequential solution doping of a conjugated polymer involves exposing a precast undoped polymer film to a dopant solution for an extended time, which then leads to the diffusion of dopant molecules into the polymer film [21]. This method allows for effective doping of polymer thin films without significantly damaging their microstructure, making it widely used for doping polymer thin films with optimized microstructures [18, 22].', 'Sequential solution doping, despite its advantages, presents some challenges. Since this doping method relies on the diffusion of dopant molecules within the already solidified polymer films, it may take a significant amount of time for the dopant molecules to penetrate deeply into the film [23, 24]. This means that for relatively thick polymer films, the dopant may not diffuse effectively throughout the entire film, resulting in considerable nonuniformity in dopant content and doping levels between the surface region and the bulk of the film. Non-uniform doping in thick polymer films can pose a serious drawback in the application of doped conjugated polymers. For example, in typical Π-structured thermoelectric devices based on conjugated polymers, a thick film is inevitably required to maximize the temperature difference across the device [25,  26]; however, the non-uniform doping in this thick film can lead to a significant deterioration of the thermoelectric performance of the device. In this context, understanding the distribution of dopant molecules within sequentially solution-doped polymer films and the factors influencing this distribution is crucial.', 'this distribution is crucial.Although many studies have revealed the spatial distribution of dopants within sequentially doped conjugated polymer films, they have primarily focused on where the dopants prefer to reside within the crystalline and amorphous regions of polymer films, or on how the inclusion of dopants affects the polymer’s crystalline structure [14–16, 27–30]. In contrast, the distribution of dopants along the thickness direction (i.e., along the out-of-plane direction) has received relatively little attention. A recent study demonstrated that doping of a conjugated polymer film using the immersion doping method leads to a significantly non-uniform dopant distribution along the thickness direction due to the limited diffusivity of dopants within the film [31]. While the study thoroughly examined the dopant diffusion process within a conjugated polymer film, it did not provide insights into how the film’s microstructure influences dopant diffusion behavior and spatial distribution. In this work, we investigate the effect of polymer crystallinity on the dopant distribution along the thickness direction of sequentially solution-doped conjugated polymer films. Using regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as a model conjugated polymer, we characterized the dopant distribution by varying the crystallinity of the polymer film via thermal annealing. Under the same conditions of sequential solution doping, it was found that while the overall dopant content within two polymer films with different degrees of crystallinity was almost similar, the distribution of dopants along the depth direction was different. The film with higher crystallinity exhibited greater nonuniformity in dopant distribution, with the ratio of dopant content between the film surface and bulk being higher in the film with greater crystallinity compared to the film with lower crystallinity. These differences are attributed to different swellabilities of the polymer films due to variations in their crystallinity, which affect the diffusion of dopant molecules within the films during the doping process.', '2 \x07Experimental', '2.1 \x07Materials', 'P3HT with regioregularity of ≥ 90% was purchased from Rieke Metals Inc. (USA). 2,3,5,6-Tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ, > 98%) was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Japan). Acetonitrile (ACN, ≥ 99.5%) and chloroform (CF,  anhydrous, ≥ 99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Inc.(Germany). The materials were used without any furtherpurification.', '2.2 \x07Preparation of polymer thin films and their sequential solution doping', 'Either soda-lime glass or a Si wafer with a native oxide was used as the substrates for sample preparation. The substrates were cleaned sequentially with detergent (Extran MA 02, Merck Millipore), deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. The substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 20 min before applying polymer solution on them. The polymer solution (5 mg \xadmL−1) was prepared by dissolving P3HT in CF at 55 °C. Then, the P3HT solution was spin-coated onto the substrates at 2000 rpm for 60 s. The resulting polymer films had a thickness of ~ 47 nm. For thermal annealing, P3HT films were placed on hot plates with a surface temperature of 200 °C for 10 min. For sequential solution doping, the dopant solution was prepared by dissolving F4TCNQ in ACN at room temperature. The concentration of the F4TCNQ dopant solution varied from 0.15 to 2.0 wt%. Doping was performed by dropping the dopant solution onto the polymer film to cover the entire surface and maintaining it for a minute to allow diffusion of dopant molecules into the polymer film. Then, the residual dopant solution was removed by spin-coating. After the doping process, doped polymer films were thermally annealed for 5 min at a mild temperature of 85 °C, which is slightly above the boiling temperature of ACN, to completely dry the doped polymer films. The entire processes of solution preparation, spin-coating, thermal annealing, and sequential solution doping were performed in a nitrogen-filled glove box.', '2.3 \x07Measurement of swelling ratio of polymer films', 'The swelling ratio of polymer films was calculated from the thicknesses of the polymer films before and after swelling in ACN. To swell the polymer films, pure ACN was poured into a glass petri dish, and the polymer films coated on Si substrates were immersed in the ACN for a minute. After being lifted from the ACN, the surface of polymer films was dried quickly by blowing with nitrogen gas to eliminate any residual solvent droplets. Then, the thicknesses of the polymer films were measured using ellipsometry (M-2000 ellipsometer, J.A. Woollam), using the Cauchy model to fit the recorded spectra in the 860–1000 nm wavelength range. Grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) measurementswere performed at the 3C and 9A beamlines of Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL), Korea. The photon energy was 9.30 keV (λ = 1.33 Å). The sample-to-detector distance was 214 mm. The incidence angle of X-ray beam was set around the critical angle of the polymer film. To compare the surface structure and the bulk structure of the polymer films, the GIXD data were recorded by varying the incidence angle by 0.5° above and below the critical angle. Ultraviolet–visible–near-infrared (UV–Vis–NIR) absorption spectra were obtained using a V-770 spectrometer (Jasco). Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained using a VERTEX 70v FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker).', '2.4 \x07Other characterizations', '3 \x07Results and discussion', '3.1 \x07Conjugated polymer thin films with different crystallinities', 'In this study, regioregular P3HT was chosen as a model conjugated polymer (Fig. 1a). P3HT thin films with different crystallinities were prepared to investigate the effect of polymer crystallinity on the dopant diffusion into polymer thin films during solution sequential doping. F4TCNQ, one of the most widely used molecular dopants for p-doping of conjugated polymers, was used in this study to dope the P3HT films via the sequential solution doping method. ACN was selected as the solvent for the dopant solution. ACN is a poor solvent for P3HT but dissolves F4TCNQ well, so it is widely used for sequential solution doping of P3HT films [21, 30, 32].', 'Thermal annealing of P3HT films at elevated temperatures is known to increase the crystallinity of the films [33]. To confirm the increased crystallinity of thermally annealed P3HT (P3HT-T) film compared to that of as-prepared P3HT (P3HT-A) film, two-dimensional (2D) GIXD measurements were performed (Fig. 1b and c). Figure 1b shows the 2D image of the diffraction pattern of P3HT-A and P3HT-T films, and Fig. 1c shows the corresponding one-dimensional diffraction intensity profiles along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. The diffraction patterns showed (h00) peaks and (010) peaks along the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, indicating a bimodal orientation distribution (i.e., both edge-on and face-on orientations coexist) of P3HT crystallites. Compared to the P3HT-A film, the P3HT-T film showed much stronger (h00) peak intensities along the out-of-plane direction and (010) peak intensity along the in-plane direction. This result indicates that the P3HT-T film has greater crystallinity than the P3HT-A film, and that P3HT-T film has a greater portion of edge-on oriented crystallites among the bimodal orientation distribution compared to the P3HT-A film.', '@', '@', '3.2 \x07Spectroscopic characterizations on doped polymer films', 'To compare the doping behavior of P3HT-A and P3HT-T films during the sequential solution doping process, the polymer films were doped with the F4TCNQ dopant solution dissolved in ACN. The details of the sequential solution doping process can be found in the Experimental section.', 'FT-IR spectra of undoped and doped P3HT-A and P3HT-T films were measured to confirm the presence of dopant molecules within the doped polymer films (Fig. 2a). In both P3HT-A and P3HT-T, regardless of whether they were doped or not, the vibronic peaks at 2800–3000 \xadcm−1, which corresponded to C–H stretching of alkanes in their hexyl side chains [34], were commonly observed. The presence of F4TCNQ in the doped polymer films was evident from the  appearance of vibronic peaks at 2170 and 2189 \xadcm−1, which corresponded to C≡N stretching in F4TCNQ anions [27]. For reference, the C≡N-stretching peak of a neutral F4TCNQ molecule is known to appear at ~ 2230 \xadcm−1 [27]. When the absorption spectra of doped P3HT-A and doped P3HT-T films were normalized by the absorption maximum of the C–H-stretching peaks of each spectrum, the normalized absorption intensities of the C≡N-stretching peaks were nearly the same (Fig. 2b), suggesting nearly the same amount of F4TCNQ anions in the two films.', '@', '@', 'UV–Vis–NIR absorption spectra were obtained to assess the occurrence and extent of doping in P3HT-A and P3HT-T before and after sequential solution doping. The left and right panels of Fig. 2c represent the absorption spectra of P3HT-A and P3HT-T films, respectively, sequentially solution-doped with the dopant solutions at various dopant concentrations. Both P3HT-A and P3HT-T films showed similar changes in spectral shapes upon doping. In the undoped state, they showed an absorption band in the visible-wavelength range at around 300–650 nm, with a maximum absorption at 550 nm. The higher crystallinity of the P3HT-T film compared to that of the P3HT-A film could be confirmed again by the more pronounced absorption shoulder at ~ 600 nm in the P3HT-T film [33]. Upon doping the polymer films with F4TCNQ, a decrease in the initial absorption at around 500 nm and the emergence of a broad absorption peak between 1000 and 2000 nm were observed, due to the formation of positive polarons in P3HT [27, 35]. Additionally, distinct peaks at 413, 770, and 870 nm appeared in the spectra of doped polymer films, which are well known to be associated with the F4TCNQ anions formed by the electron transfer from P3HT to F4TCNQ upon doping [27]. The decrease in the initial absorption intensity and the increase of newly formed absorption peaks due to doping became more pronounced as the dopant concentration in solution increased, indicating a higher doping level of P3HT for the film doped with the dopant solution of greater concentration. When comparing the spectra of P3HT-A and P3HT-T films doped at the same dopant concentration, the intensities of P3HT positive polarons and F4TCNQ anions were slightly greater in P3HT-T than in P3HT-A; this was observed for all dopant concentrations tested. The greater polymer positive polaron and dopant anion intensities in P3HT-T than in P3HT-A, despite nearly the same dopant contents within them, suggested that the ionization of the dopant was slightly more efficient in the P3HT-T film than in the P3HT-A film, likely due to its greater degree of crystallinity and charge delocalization [36].', '3.3 \x07Effect of polymer crystallinity on the dopant distribution within polymer films', 'The effect of the polymer film’s crystallinity on the spatialdistribution of dopant molecules along the out-of-plane direction was investigated based on the structural analysis of the doped polymer films using 2D GIXD (Fig. 3). 2D GIXD measurements were performed at different X-ray incidence angles to compare the surface structure and the bulk structure of the doped P3HT films. At low incidence angles below the critical angle of the polymer film, the incident beam interacts with the polymer film at only a short distance below the film surface. In contrast, at high incidence angles above the critical angle of the polymer film, the incident beam penetrates the polymer film and interacts primarily with the bulk of the film. Therefore, comparing GIXD data obtained slightly below and above the critical angle is an effective way to assess the surface and bulk structures of the polymer films [37, 38].', 'Figure 3a shows the 2D images of GIXD patterns for doped P3HT-A and doped P3HT-T films obtained at low and high incidence angles. Figure 3b presents the one-dimensional intensity profiles along the out-of-plane direction derived from the 2D images in Fig. 3a. The profiles of undoped films are also shown in the plot for comparison. The (h00) and (010) diffraction peaks of P3HT crystals were observed in the doped films, similar to those in the undoped films. However, the peak positions shifted significantly upon doping; the (h00) peaks shifted toward smaller q values, while the (010) peak shifted toward larger q values. This trend is consistent with the previous reports [21, 28, 32], and such changes in crystal structure indicate that F4TCNQ molecules are incorporated within P3HT crystallites, especially in the lamellar regions between hexyl side chains of P3HT [28, 29]. In addition to the diffraction peaks of P3HT, the doped P3HT films also showed a new diffraction peak at q =  ~ 0.84 Å−1, which is assigned to the diffraction pattern that arises from F4TCNQ [27, 39].', 'Doped P3HT-A and P3HT-T films showed distinct X-ray incident angle dependence in their peak positions. While the doped P3HT-A film exhibited nearly the same (100) and (010) peak positions regardless of the incidence angle, the doped P3HT-T film displayed different (100) and (010) peak positions depending on the incidence angle. In the case of the doped P3HT-A, the (010) peak appeared at q = 1.691 and 1.689 Å−1 for high and low incidence angles, respectively, indicating virtually the same peak positions. The position of the (100) peak could not be quantified accurately due to its weak and broad nature. In contrast, in the case of the doped P3HT-T, the (010) peak appeared at q = 1.715 and 1.743 Å−1 for high and low incidence angles, respectively, while the (100) peak appeared at q = 0.341 and 0.333 Å−1 for high and low incidence angles, respectively. This suggests that the crystalline structure at the surface region of the doped P3HT-T film is quite different from that of the bulk region, with the surface region exhibiting more increased lamellar spacing and  more decreased π–π stacking distance compared to thoseof the film’s bulk. The changes in π–π stacking distanceand lamellar spacing are presented in Fig. 3c.', '@', '@', '@', 'Considering that the π–π stacking distance decreases more and the lamellar spacing increases more with respect to the increasing amount of dopant molecules incorporated into the P3HT crystals [32], the observed dependence of the diffraction peak position of doped P3HT-T on the X-ray incidence angle implies that the dopant concentration near the surface of doped P3HT-T is relatively greater than that in the bulk. On the other hand, the independence of the diffraction peak position of doped P3HT-A from the X-ray incidence angle indicates that there is no significant difference in the dopant concentration between the surface and the bulk regions of doped P3HT-A film.', 'It should be noted that, as confirmed earlier by the FT-IR spectroscopy results, the amount of dopant molecules present in the two polymer films is almost similar. Therefore, the above GIXD results do not arise from the difference in the absolute content of dopants within the two P3HT films, but rather from the different degrees of dopant diffusion from polymer surface toward the bulk, for the same overall of dopant contents within the films. That is, the diffusion of the dopant into the bulk of the film was less efficient in the more crystalline P3HT-T, resulting in a greater amount of dopant near the surface compared to the bulk.', '3.4 \x07Discussion on the origin of crystallinity‑dependent dopant distribution', 'It has been reported that the degree of swelling of a polymer thin film by solvents depends on the crystallinity of the polymer film; the higher the crystallinity of a conjugated polymer thin film, the lower the swelling ratio of the film, in general [40–43]. According to previous studies on the swelling of semicrystalline polymers, polymer crystallites are hardly penetrable to solvents, and thus, swelling occurs predominantly in the amorphous phase of the polymer films [42, 43]. Therefore, the trend of decreasing swelling ratio with respect to increasing polymer crystallinity can be understood as a result of the greater content of polymer crystallites within the film with higher crystallinity than that within the film with lower crystallinity. Based on this knowledge, we speculated that the swellability of P3HT thin films would change as a result of varied crystallinity of the films via thermal annealing; that is, the P3HT-T film would exhibit a smaller swelling ratio than the P3HT-A film when they reached swelling equilibrium with ACN due to its greater crystallinity. This speculation was shown to be valid by directly measuring the thickness of P3HT-A and P3HT-T films before and after swelling (Fig. 4). Film thicknesses were measured using an ellipsometer, fitting the recorded spectral data using the Cauchy model. In the fitting process,  only the wavelength region of 860–1000 nm was used to avoid the excitonic absorption peaks of the polymer films. In swelling the polymer films, pure ACN was used as the swelling agent, because it is the solvent of the F4TCNQ dopant solution used in our sequential solution doping process. The detailed procedure for swelling polymer films is provided in the Experimental section. After dipping the P3HT-A and P3HT-T polymer films in pure ACN for 5 min, the thickness of the films increased considerably compared to the initial (i.e., dried-state) thickness, indicating the uptake of ACN molecules in the polymer films. While the thicknesses of the dried P3HT-A and P3HT-T films are almost identical at ~ 47 nm, the thicknesses of the swelled films were significantly different, showing 53 (± 1.5) and 49 (± 0.2) nm for P3HT-A and P3HT-T, respectively (Fig. 4a). The corresponding percent increase in the film thickness was 11.3% for P3HT-A and 4.0% for P3HT-T (Fig. 4b). These results clearly show that the swellability of the P3HT films depends significantly on their crystallinities.', 'We expect that the crystallinity-dependent dopant distribution originates mainly from the different swellability of the polymer films. Swelling of polymer films by dopant solvent is known to be essential for the efficient diffusion of dopant molecules into polymer films during sequential solution doping process [20, 22, 43]. Previous studies have  reported that the more a polymer swells due to the dopant solvent, the easier the dopant diffusion can occur during sequential solution doping [20, 22]. Therefore, it is likely that the lower degree of swelling of P3HT-T compared to P3HT-A, due to its higher crystallinity, would lead to less-effective dopant diffusion into the bulk of the polymer film, resulting in the pronounced nonuniformity of the F4TCNQ distribution along the depth direction in doped P3HT-T film compared to that of doped P3HT-A film. The effect of polymer crystallinity on the dopant distribution of sequentially solution-doped polymer film is depicted schematically in Fig. 4c.', 'One might think that the different diffusion rates of dopants in the crystalline and amorphous regions of P3HT would also affect the dopant distribution in doped P3HT-A and P3HT-T films. Previous studies investigating the correlation between dopant diffusion and the ordering of conjugated polymers have demonstrated that dopant molecules tend to diffuse more slowly in disordered regions than in ordered regions of polythiophene-based conjugated polymer thin films [23, 44]. Based on this, if the different dopant distributions in P3HT-A and P3HT-T films originated from different diffusion rates of dopants in crystalline and amorphous regions, the dopant distribution should be more uniform along the depth direction in P3HT-T than  of dopant diffusion behavior into polymer films with differentcrystallinities and swellabilities. The consequent dopant distributionwithin each film is also demonstrated', '@', '@', 'in P3HT-A due to its higher crystallinity; however, our experimental observations indicate the opposite. Therefore, the observed dopant distribution cannot be explained based on different diffusion coefficients of dopants in crystalline and amorphous regions. Instead, it is more plausible that the different dopant distributions in P3HT-A and P3HT-T films are primarily attributed to their different degrees of swelling during the sequential solution doping process.', '4 \x07Conclusions', 'In summary, we investigated the effect of polymer crystallinity on the spatial distribution of dopants, especially along the direction perpendicular to the film surface, within sequentially solution-doped polymer films. The crystallinity of conjugated polymer films was controlled by thermal annealing, which resulted in greater crystallinity for the thermally annealed film compared to that of the as-prepared film. When the two films were sequentially doped with a dopant solution under the same conditions, they showed nearly the same dopant content over the entire film but had different dopant distributions along the depth direction; the film with greater crystallinity exhibited a more uneven distribution of the dopant compared to that with lower crystallinity, with a higher composition of the dopant at the surface than in the bulk. The difference in the dopant distributions was attributed to the different degree of swelling between the two films. That is, the film with higher crystallinity swelled less by the dopant solvent, which likely resulted in a relatively less efficient diffusion of the dopant from the surface into the bulk, leading to a higher concentration of dopant near the surface compared to the bulk. The findings of this study provide a deep understanding of how the structure of polymer films affects the diffusion behavior of dopants during the sequential solution doping process and are believed to offer insights into more efficient and systematic control of doping in conjugated polymer thin films.', 'Acknowledgements Y.

Sarathchandran3 · Anjaly Sivadas1 · Robert A. Shanks4', 'Received: 27 December 2024 / Revised: 14 February 2025 / Accepted: 9 March 2025  © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025', 'Abstract', 'The crystallization kinetics, spherulitic growth rate and morphology development of a non-polar blend mixture [isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and natural rubber (NR)] with strong dynamic asymmetry are investigated comprehensively. Melt mixed samples of iPP and natural NR with different NR loading were subjected to ther-mal analysis using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric (TGA) followed by crystal growth using optical microscopy (OM). Prior to melt mixing, the NR samples were masticated for 30 min so as to reduce the molecular weight. Detailed evaluation of the kinetics of crystallization, growth rate of crystals, and morphology development in a dynamically asymmetric system is challenging especially when the second component is a semi-crystalline polymer and studies on such systems have not received significant attention.', 'Introduction', 'Mixing two or more polymers is a well-established approach for designing materials with specific end use [1]. Changes in inherent characteristics and processing conditions of the component polymers are the main factors that influence the ultimate properties of polymer blends. Morphology and thermal properties of individual polymers play a major role in the precise manipulation of the properties (mechanical, optical, electrical,  etc.), thereby leading to the successful development of polymer blends with a unique set of properties. The situation is far more challenging when one of the blend compo-nents is a semi-crystalline polymer due to several competing reactions, including phase separation, nucleation and crystal growth, ripening of crystal structure, etc. However, semi-crystalline polymers and their blends are quite extensively used in the automo-bile industry. Thereby, it is of industrial/academic interest to study the crystallization behavior of immiscible blend systems especially with dynamic asymmetry. This can be achieved by the addition of a high molecular weight additive to the semi-crystalline polymer matrix [2–4]. The influence of introducing low molecular weight additives [5–7] and fillers [8–10] have been extensively investigated. Even then, the effect of add-ing high molecular weight additives such as elastomers, block copolymers [11, 12] etc., to a semi-crystalline polymer matrix has not received significant attention.', 'The ease of processability, coupled with desirable characteristics/properties, makes polypropylene (iPP) an appealing thermoplastic for broad applications rang-ing from the automotive industry to biomedical industry [13] making it the best candidate for the present study. Even though the crystallization kinetics and mor-phology of iPP-based blends [14–19] and the influence of additives (especially those of low molecular weight) on the crystallization and morphology of semi-crystalline polymers have already been investigated [20, 21]. The influence of adding a high molecular weight polymer on segmental dynamics, crystallization kinetics and ther-mal stability remains unexplored and requires special attention. Rheological, mor-phological and mechanical properties of high molecular weight NR blended with PP have been extensively studied [22–24]. But an in-depth analysis of the thermal prop-erties of iPP-NR blends is not available especially, while using NR as a toughening agent. The very large difference in molecular weight between iPP and NR makes them a dynamically asymmetric system. Since the role of NR as a toughening agent for iPP was the main aim of present work, fillers were not used as this would inhibit the contribution of NR to morphology development and, in turn, mechanical proper-ties. The current manuscript ushers to provide fundamental insights into the crystal-lization kinetics, morphology development and thermal stability of a dynamic asym-metric blend with a semi-crystalline component.', 'The current research deals with subjecting the blends to different thermal his-tories to determine the glass transition temperature (Tg), melting temperature (Tm), and melting enthalpy (ΔHm) using DSC. Apart from these, isothermal crystalliza-tion experiments were carried out to determine the half-time of crystallization (t0.5) and the kinetic parameters, which include the Avrami exponent (n) and the overall rate of crystallization (K1/n). Besides, the spherulitic growth of the blend has been followed using polarizing optical microscopy (POM).', 'Experimental', 'Materials', 'iPP (Repol-H350 FG) was supplied by Reliance Industries Limited with melt flow index, (230 °C/2.16 kg) of 38 g/min and heat deflection temperature (455 kPa) of  104 °C.

To improve mixing efficiency, the high viscosity NR was reduced by masticating it for 5 min in a two-roll mill with a nip clearance of 3 mm and a friction ratio of 1.25:1 (20/15 rpm, back roll/front roll). Blends with different blend ratios of iPP and NR (100–0, 90–10, 80–20, 70–30 60–40 and 50–50) were melt-mixed using a Brabender Plastocorder.

The result obtained is shown in Fig. 2.', 'It can be observed that as the amount of NR increases, the ξ showed a gradual decrease which is in accordance with the morphology change observed using SEM. Gradual increases in the amount of NR result in a change from droplet-matrix to co-continuous type morphology. This is in exact correlation with calculated CRR values. In the case of the blend with 50%·w/w of NR, an increase in CRR can be observed due to phase inversion. The crystallization of a semi-crystalline polymer in a blend can be affected by its counterpart. Molecular structure and molecular weight of the components, blend composition, type and degree of dispersion for dif-ferent phases in the molten stage, phase interaction at the interface of the individ-ual homopolymers and crystallization conditions are some of the major factors that affect the crystallinity in the polymer. The crystallinity (χ) [28, 29] is given by,', '휒% =ΔHmΔH◦ m × Vf× 100,', 'where ΔHm and Vf are the enthalpy of fusion and volume fraction of iPP, respec-tively. The ΔH0m is the heat of fusion of 100% pure crystalline PP which was taken as iPP is 209 J·g−1. [30] The crystallinity increases with NR loading, reaches a maxi-mum of 30% w/w of NR and thereafter decreases (refer to Fig. 3). The decrease in ξ and increase in χ indicate that small fractions of NR aid the crystallization of iPP by serving as nucleating agents, and the amorphous fraction of iPP has weak van der Waal’s interaction with NR, with the interactions sensitive to NR loading. Figure 3 shows the melting curve for iPP–NR blend system (Table 2).', 'Endotherms for the second heating cycle were used to evaluate the melting behavior. This eliminates the influence of processing history on melting behavior. The melting temperature is almost the same in all blends (~ 163 °C). However, a small broadening of the melting peak can be observed, which may be due to the  melting of different-sized crystals or disordered crystals formed by the addition of NR.', '@', '@', 'The endotherm obtained for iPP-NR blends after crystallization at selected crys-tallization temperatures (Tc) was used to calculate the equilibrium melting tempera-ture (Tm°) using Hoffman–Weeks Eq. (4) [31–33],', 'Tm = Tc2훽+ T0 m[1 −12훽]', ' Here Tm is the melting temperature calculated at selected Tc and 훽= lcl∗c is the thick-ening factor that is greater than or equal to one. Plot of Tmº against blend composi-tion is shown in Fig. 4.', 'The trend for Tm° has wide implications for polymer blends. An increasing value for Tm° indicates that the crystalline fraction is compatible with the added amor-phous component. An increase in Tm° is rarely encountered. A decrease in Tm° indicates attractive interactions between the blend components. It can be observed from Fig. 4 that the Tm° for iPP–NR blend shows a decreasing trend indicating that the crystalline fraction of iPP is having an attractive interaction with NR. Figure 5 shows the crystallization of iPP–NR blend at a selected Tc of 130 °C.', 'It follows from Fig. 6 that the addition of NR influenced the crystallization of iPP, and the rate of crystallization increased with the addition of NR. The broad-ened exotherm of neat iPP sharpens with NR loading, indicating favorable inter-action between iPP and NR. Neat iPP requires more time to crystallize than that  of NR blended iPP, confirming the efficiency of NR as a nucleating agent. The isothermal crystallization studies were carried out to evaluate the crystallization kinetics for iPP–NR blends as a function of NR loading. The time taken for half the crystallinity to develop (t0.5) is recommended to remove the influence of the overall rate of crystallization on the phase boundaries of a heterogeneous system. Figure 6 shows a plot of t0.5 against Tc (124–132 °C) for iPP and iPP–NR blends.', '@', '@', 'The crystalline kinetics for polymeric materials can be best explained usingthe Avrami Eq. (5) [34–36] as,', 'X(t) = 1 −exp[−K1∕n A t]n', 'The conversion, X(t), is the normalized crystallinity given as the ratio of the crystallinity at time, t, and the final crystallinity. KA1/n and n represent the over-all rate of crystallization and the Avrami exponent respectively (refer to Fig. 7). Table 2 shows the value of K and n obtained for the PP-NR blend at different Tcs.', 'The Avrami exponent n is expected to have integral values, where a value between 1 and 2 represents 1D crystal growth, values between 2 and 3 indicate 2D crystal growth, while values between 3 and 4 represent 3D crystal growth and above 4 indicate heterogeneous nucleation. iPP–NR blends show a value of n close to 3, indicating sporadic nucleation with 2 D crystal growth. The non-inte-gral value represents the non-Fickian contribution to the crystallization process. Figure 8 represents the plot of (t0.5)−1 against (ΔTc)−1.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '(t0.5)−1 = A exp(−BΔTc)', 'Here A is the frequency factor, and B is the ratio of energy densities in the lamella fold surface and bulk formulated using the Kelvin equation. Figure 8 can be used to calculate the activation energy for the crystallization of the crystalliz-able component (here iPP) in a polymer blend. A semi-logarithmic plot of (t0.5) −1 versus (∆T)−1 as shown in Fig. 8, is linear in the Tc range investigated for neat iPP  and iPP–NR blends. Figure 9 exhibits quantities (Ea) extracted from the slope ofthe semi-logarithmic plot of (t0.5) −1 versus (∆T)−1 for iPP in blends.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Figure 9 confirms that the Ea of iPP increases up to NR loading of 20%·w/w, and thereafter it shows a decrease, while for a blend with 50%·w/w of NR, it shows a substantial increase. The reason for this is the change in morphology (from droplet-matrix type to co-continuous type), as discussed in the following section.', 'SEM analysis shows droplet-matrix type morphology with gradual change to co-continuous type as a function of NR loading, (50%·w/w NR loading onwards) as evidenced by the SEM images shown in Fig. 10.', 'Figure 11 displays the optical micrographs of spherulite growth at 130 °C at thecooling rate of 10 °C/min in neat iPP, and iPP–NR blend with magnification of 10X.', 'Figure 11a confirms the presence of a well-defined “Maltese cross [14]” coin-ciding with the principal axis of crystal and extinction direction of the polarizer/analyzer, indicating uniform crystal growth. Higher concentrations of NR exhibit co-continuous morphology, preventing the actual growth of iPP spherulites and disappearing Maltase cross for the spherulite developed in the iPP–NR 50–50 composition [37, 38]. For a better understanding, magnified images 10× are shown in Fig. 12.', 'Spherulite growth rate (G) can be evaluated from the slope of the radius versus time curve, and Fig. 13a shows the growth rate for iPP, calculated from POM images. Figure 13b displays the contribution of the blend ratio on G over a different temperature range (124–136 °C). The spherulite growth rate reveals a decreasing pattern with increasing content of NR, and it is prominent at lower crystallization temperatures.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'However, G is unaffected by the blend ratio at higher Tc. This can be due to the slower growth rate because of the high molecular mobility. TGA and DTA plots for iPP and iPP–NR blends are shown in Fig. 14a, b respectively.', 'The experiment was performed between temperature ranges of 30 to 700 °C. Fig-ure 14a shows that neat iPP has single-step degradation with high thermal stabil-ity (decomposition onset of 385 °C), while 50% of degradation occurs at 474 °C. With the addition of NR to the iPP matrix, a gradual decrement of onset of degra-dation reaching up to 308 °C can be observed (50%∙w/w of NR). It is noteworthy that blends of iPP–NR exhibit two degradation steps, indicating a highly immiscible system, which is obvious from the DTG curves (Fig. 3). Peak obtained in the range  of 350 to 400 °C represents the degradation of NR, while iPP degradation occurred at 450 to 500 °C.', '@', '@', 'Conclusion', 'The crystallization kinetics, spherulitic growth rate and melting properties of iPP blended with non-polar counterpart have been evaluated and correlated to blend morphology. The addition of NR to iPP produces a gradual change in morphology  from droplet-matrix to co-continuous type, and this resulted in a predominant con-tribution to the crystallization kinetics of iPP and the mutual interaction between the blend components. Decrease in Tm° with NR loading, point to the existence of weak attractive interactions between the blend components. This is also reflected in the spherulite growth rate. Even though the blending of iPP with other polymers has been studied and reported quite extensively, the effect of dynamic asymmetry on thermal properties and morphology development remains unexplored. Considering the commercial importance of iPP in various sectors, a detailed evaluation of the effect of molecular weight on thermal, mechanical and morphological properties is extremely important. The present study will usher in the development of iPP-based blends and nanocomposites with improved thermal and mechanical properties.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Acknowledgements I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Professor Chin Han Chan, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Malaysia, whose guidance, encouragement, and unwavering support were instrumen-tal in the development of this research.

Sarathchandran3 · Anjaly Sivadas1 · Robert A. Shanks4', 'Received: 27 December 2024 / Revised: 14 February 2025 / Accepted: 9 March 2025  © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025', 'Abstract', 'The crystallization kinetics, spherulitic growth rate and morphology development of a non-polar blend mixture [isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and natural rubber (NR)] with strong dynamic asymmetry are investigated comprehensively. Melt mixed samples of iPP and natural NR with different NR loading were subjected to ther-mal analysis using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric (TGA) followed by crystal growth using optical microscopy (OM). Prior to melt mixing, the NR samples were masticated for 30 min so as to reduce the molecular weight. Detailed evaluation of the kinetics of crystallization, growth rate of crystals, and morphology development in a dynamically asymmetric system is challenging especially when the second component is a semi-crystalline polymer and studies on such systems have not received significant attention.', 'Introduction', 'Mixing two or more polymers is a well-established approach for designing materials with specific end use [1]. Changes in inherent characteristics and processing conditions of the component polymers are the main factors that influence the ultimate properties of polymer blends. Morphology and thermal properties of individual polymers play a major role in the precise manipulation of the properties (mechanical, optical, electrical,  etc.), thereby leading to the successful development of polymer blends with a unique set of properties. The situation is far more challenging when one of the blend compo-nents is a semi-crystalline polymer due to several competing reactions, including phase separation, nucleation and crystal growth, ripening of crystal structure, etc. However, semi-crystalline polymers and their blends are quite extensively used in the automo-bile industry. Thereby, it is of industrial/academic interest to study the crystallization behavior of immiscible blend systems especially with dynamic asymmetry. This can be achieved by the addition of a high molecular weight additive to the semi-crystalline polymer matrix [2–4]. The influence of introducing low molecular weight additives [5–7] and fillers [8–10] have been extensively investigated. Even then, the effect of add-ing high molecular weight additives such as elastomers, block copolymers [11, 12] etc., to a semi-crystalline polymer matrix has not received significant attention.', 'The ease of processability, coupled with desirable characteristics/properties, makes polypropylene (iPP) an appealing thermoplastic for broad applications rang-ing from the automotive industry to biomedical industry [13] making it the best candidate for the present study. Even though the crystallization kinetics and mor-phology of iPP-based blends [14–19] and the influence of additives (especially those of low molecular weight) on the crystallization and morphology of semi-crystalline polymers have already been investigated [20, 21]. The influence of adding a high molecular weight polymer on segmental dynamics, crystallization kinetics and ther-mal stability remains unexplored and requires special attention. Rheological, mor-phological and mechanical properties of high molecular weight NR blended with PP have been extensively studied [22–24]. But an in-depth analysis of the thermal prop-erties of iPP-NR blends is not available especially, while using NR as a toughening agent. The very large difference in molecular weight between iPP and NR makes them a dynamically asymmetric system. Since the role of NR as a toughening agent for iPP was the main aim of present work, fillers were not used as this would inhibit the contribution of NR to morphology development and, in turn, mechanical proper-ties. The current manuscript ushers to provide fundamental insights into the crystal-lization kinetics, morphology development and thermal stability of a dynamic asym-metric blend with a semi-crystalline component.', 'The current research deals with subjecting the blends to different thermal his-tories to determine the glass transition temperature (Tg), melting temperature (Tm), and melting enthalpy (ΔHm) using DSC. Apart from these, isothermal crystalliza-tion experiments were carried out to determine the half-time of crystallization (t0.5) and the kinetic parameters, which include the Avrami exponent (n) and the overall rate of crystallization (K1/n). Besides, the spherulitic growth of the blend has been followed using polarizing optical microscopy (POM).', 'Experimental', 'Materials', 'iPP (Repol-H350 FG) was supplied by Reliance Industries Limited with melt flow index, (230 °C/2.16 kg) of 38 g/min and heat deflection temperature (455 kPa) of  104 °C.

The result obtained is shown in Fig. 2.', 'It can be observed that as the amount of NR increases, the ξ showed a gradual decrease which is in accordance with the morphology change observed using SEM. Gradual increases in the amount of NR result in a change from droplet-matrix to co-continuous type morphology. This is in exact correlation with calculated CRR values. In the case of the blend with 50%·w/w of NR, an increase in CRR can be observed due to phase inversion. The crystallization of a semi-crystalline polymer in a blend can be affected by its counterpart. Molecular structure and molecular weight of the components, blend composition, type and degree of dispersion for dif-ferent phases in the molten stage, phase interaction at the interface of the individ-ual homopolymers and crystallization conditions are some of the major factors that affect the crystallinity in the polymer. The crystallinity (χ) [28, 29] is given by,', '휒% =ΔHmΔH◦ m × Vf× 100,', 'where ΔHm and Vf are the enthalpy of fusion and volume fraction of iPP, respec-tively. The ΔH0m is the heat of fusion of 100% pure crystalline PP which was taken as iPP is 209 J·g−1. [30] The crystallinity increases with NR loading, reaches a maxi-mum of 30% w/w of NR and thereafter decreases (refer to Fig. 3). The decrease in ξ and increase in χ indicate that small fractions of NR aid the crystallization of iPP by serving as nucleating agents, and the amorphous fraction of iPP has weak van der Waal’s interaction with NR, with the interactions sensitive to NR loading. Figure 3 shows the melting curve for iPP–NR blend system (Table 2).', 'Endotherms for the second heating cycle were used to evaluate the melting behavior. This eliminates the influence of processing history on melting behavior. The melting temperature is almost the same in all blends (~ 163 °C). However, a small broadening of the melting peak can be observed, which may be due to the  melting of different-sized crystals or disordered crystals formed by the addition of NR.', '@', '@', 'The endotherm obtained for iPP-NR blends after crystallization at selected crys-tallization temperatures (Tc) was used to calculate the equilibrium melting tempera-ture (Tm°) using Hoffman–Weeks Eq.

Plot of Tmº against blend composi-tion is shown in Fig. 4.', 'The trend for Tm° has wide implications for polymer blends. An increasing value for Tm° indicates that the crystalline fraction is compatible with the added amor-phous component. An increase in Tm° is rarely encountered. A decrease in Tm° indicates attractive interactions between the blend components. It can be observed from Fig. 4 that the Tm° for iPP–NR blend shows a decreasing trend indicating that the crystalline fraction of iPP is having an attractive interaction with NR. Figure 5 shows the crystallization of iPP–NR blend at a selected Tc of 130 °C.', 'It follows from Fig. 6 that the addition of NR influenced the crystallization of iPP, and the rate of crystallization increased with the addition of NR. The broad-ened exotherm of neat iPP sharpens with NR loading, indicating favorable inter-action between iPP and NR. Neat iPP requires more time to crystallize than that  of NR blended iPP, confirming the efficiency of NR as a nucleating agent. The isothermal crystallization studies were carried out to evaluate the crystallization kinetics for iPP–NR blends as a function of NR loading. The time taken for half the crystallinity to develop (t0.5) is recommended to remove the influence of the overall rate of crystallization on the phase boundaries of a heterogeneous system.

TGA and DTA plots for iPP and iPP–NR blends are shown in Fig. 14a, b respectively.', 'The experiment was performed between temperature ranges of 30 to 700 °C. Fig-ure 14a shows that neat iPP has single-step degradation with high thermal stabil-ity (decomposition onset of 385 °C), while 50% of degradation occurs at 474 °C. With the addition of NR to the iPP matrix, a gradual decrement of onset of degra-dation reaching up to 308 °C can be observed (50%∙w/w of NR). It is noteworthy that blends of iPP–NR exhibit two degradation steps, indicating a highly immiscible system, which is obvious from the DTG curves (Fig. 3). Peak obtained in the range  of 350 to 400 °C represents the degradation of NR, while iPP degradation occurred at 450 to 500 °C.', '@', '@', 'Conclusion', 'The crystallization kinetics, spherulitic growth rate and melting properties of iPP blended with non-polar counterpart have been evaluated and correlated to blend morphology. The addition of NR to iPP produces a gradual change in morphology  from droplet-matrix to co-continuous type, and this resulted in a predominant con-tribution to the crystallization kinetics of iPP and the mutual interaction between the blend components. Decrease in Tm° with NR loading, point to the existence of weak attractive interactions between the blend components. This is also reflected in the spherulite growth rate. Even though the blending of iPP with other polymers has been studied and reported quite extensively, the effect of dynamic asymmetry on thermal properties and morphology development remains unexplored. Considering the commercial importance of iPP in various sectors, a detailed evaluation of the effect of molecular weight on thermal, mechanical and morphological properties is extremely important. The present study will usher in the development of iPP-based blends and nanocomposites with improved thermal and mechanical properties.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Acknowledgements I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Professor Chin Han Chan, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Malaysia, whose guidance, encouragement, and unwavering support were instrumen-tal in the development of this research.

2025-05-21 14:52:43 - WARNING: ['Polyurethanes synthesized from diisocyanate trimers and polyethylene glycol undergo crosslinking via thermally reversible Diels–Alder reactions', 'Heru Santoso1,2 · Sabrina Aufar Salma2 · Frita Yuliati2 · Shayrilla Chairunnisa Nur Afifa3 · Sumarno Sumarno1', 'Received: 11 November 2024 / Revised: 17 February 2025 / Accepted: 7 March 2025  © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Polymer Society of Korea 2025', 'Abstract', 'A series of self-healing polyurethane (PU) polymers were synthesized via the Diels–Alder reaction between the furan-functionalized PU prepolymer and bismaleimide (BMI). The PU prepolymer is a reaction product of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and a pentamethylene diisocyanate trimer (PDI-t). Furfuryl amine was attached to the terminal isocyanic groups of PU, resulting in furfuryl amine polyurethane (PU-FA). PU-FA was cross-linked via dynamic bonds between the furan groups and BMI, generating reversible bonds with the material. This study explored reversible polymer networks under various thermal conditions, including different reaction parameters, prepolymer ratios, and healing temperatures, to evaluate the healing capabilities of these polymers. The results demonstrated that PU-DA exhibits thermal reversibility, as evidenced by the appearance of an endothermic peak in the DSC analysis, indicating bond cleavage via the retro-Diels–Alder (r-DA) reaction. This endothermic peak re-emerged after cooling at 70 °C for 24 h, further confirming the reversibility of the reac-tion. Additionally, crack healing in the PU-DA film was facilitated by the synergistic effects of the thermally reversible Diels–Alder reaction and the thermal mobility of molecular chains. The self-healing performance evaluation revealed that PU-DA samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 exhibited a reduction in tensile strength after healing compared to the original PU-DA specimens before heat treatment. Conversely, samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 demonstrated a healing efficiency exceeding 100%, attributed to the enhanced cross-link density, which contributed to a more robust network structure.', '@', '@', "In this study, self-healing Diels-Alder polyurethane (PU-DA) was successfully synthesized using PDI trimer. The findings confirmed that the material's healing mechanism is activated by the reversible interaction between furan and maleimide groups within PU-DA, enabling it to autonomously repair structural damage", 'Keywords Polyurethane · Prepolymer · Self-healing · Pentamethylene diisocyanate trimer · Diels–Alder', '1 Introduction', 'Polyurethane has profoundly improved the quality of modern life through its diverse applications across multiple  industries. It is integral in enhancing the performance and functionality of products in sectors, such as coatings, automotive, textiles, synthetic leather, electronics, construction materials, aerospace, and medicine. This  versatile material not only improves the durability and efficiency of these products but also contributes to advances in technology and quality of life [1–4]. In practical applications, polyurethane is susceptible to the development of small cracks due to factors, such as heat, mechanical stress, and exposure to chemicals. These microcracks can significantly reduce the service life of polyurethane and are often challenging to detect visually [5]. Inspired by the self-repair mechanisms observed in nature, scientists have engineered polymers with inherent self-healing capabilities within certain limits. Self-healing strategies can be broadly categorized as extrinsic or intrinsic [6]. Extrinsic self-healing involves the incorporation of a healing agent within a polymer matrix; however, this method lacks reusability, because the healing agent is depleted upon each use. With this method, no external stimuli are needed for healing to occur. Conversely, the intrinsic self-healing system enables repetitive healing across multiple cycles of damage, although most methods in this system require external stimuli to initiate the healing process. As a result, intrinsic self-healing materials have attracted increasing attention in recent years [7].', 'Intrinsic self-healing materials normally contain dynamic bonds or interactions that can be broken and reformed to heal the material. These bonds can be covalent or nonco-valent in nature. Covalent bonds are often used because of their high strength of the bonds. Some examples of these bonds are Diels–Alder, disulfide, radical interactions, and cyclic compounds [8, 9]. Numerous studies have been conducted to develop self-healing polyurethanes with Diels–Alder chemistry. Self-healing polyurethanes (SH-PU) via the Diels–Alder method mostly comprise isocyanic polyurethane (to differ from nonisocyanic polyurethane) and commonly employ two main approaches. The first method involves the incorporation of furan terminals into the PU prepolymer, which are subsequently crosslinked with bis-maleimide (BMI). The second method involves the prepa-ration of a PU prepolymer containing maleimide pendant groups, which consequently react with difunctional furan compounds to produce SH-PU [5].', 'For isocyanates, researchers prefer the use of aliphatic isocyanate trimers for polyurethane coatings, because they offer lower toxicity, enhanced thermal stability, superior mechanical properties, and increased weather resistance [10]. The use of isocyanate trimers in the synthesis of self-healing polyurethane via the Diels–Alder system is wide-spread among researchers, with isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) trimers being the most commonly used [11–13]. IPDI is a cycloaliphatic isocyanate with one ring structure, whereas the IPDI trimer comprises a structure with four rings. These rings make the obtained polyurethane more rigid than when the diisocyanate is fully aliphatic, while more flexible materials are needed. To fill this gap, the  entirely aliphatic hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and its trimers (HDI-t) were used. Researchers have used HDI-t to fabricate self-healing polymers [14–22]. To answer the demand for greener materials, the bio-based pentamethyl-ene diisocyanate and its trimer are already available in the market. Some researchers have employed pentamethylene diisocyanate trimers (PDI-t) in the synthesis of functional polyurethanes [23–25]. Most studies on self-healing polyu-rethanes primarily use the conventional isocyanates derived from fossil resources, such as 1,6-diisocyanatohexane (HDI), which does not align with the growing demand for more environmentally sustainable and eco-friendly materials [26, 27]. Despite its promising potential to improve cross-linking density and mechanical properties, the use of PDI-trimer derived from bio-based sources as an isocyanate has not been widely explored. In this study, we investigated the self-healing synthesis of PDI-trimer as an isocyanate through the Diels–Alder reaction method, focusing on the impact of the NCO/OH ratio on its thermal behavior, healing efficiency, and mechanical performance. A series of PU prepolymer formulations were synthesized from polyethylene glycol (PEG) and PDI-trimer (PDI-t) at different reaction times, temperatures, and NCO/OH ratios. These prepolymers were then reacted with furfuryl amine (FA) to yield PU-FA. Addi-tionally, self-healing polyurethane (SH-PU) was synthesized by cross-linking PU-FA with bismaleimide (BMI) via the Diels–Alder reaction. These experiments were performed to understand how the different synthesis conditions affect the mechanical properties and healing behavior of the end polymer products. The knowledge is expected to contribute to the development of green polyurethane, particularly for coating application.', '2 \x07Experimental', '2.1 \x07Materials', "Furfurylamine (99%, FA), 1,1'-(methylenedi-4,1-phenylene) bismaleimide (BMI), polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG), and dibutyltin dilaurate (95%, DBTDL) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Before polymerization, polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG) with a molecular weight of 4000 g/mol was dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 2 h. The isocyanate trimer Desmodur® eco N7300 (pentamethylene diisocy-anate/PDI-t), with an NCO content of 21.9% and an equiva-lent weight of 195, was sourced directly from PT Covestro Indonesia without further purification. Dimethylformamide (DMF), which was used as the solvent in the procedure, was purchased from Merck. Polyurethane with a furan terminal (PU-FA) and self-healing polyurethane (PU-DA) were syn-thesized as described in the previous studies [11, 28]. The synthesis details are described in the supporting information. FTIR spectroscopy spectra were acquired using a Brucker Tensor 27 spectrometer via the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) method, which uses 64 scans with a resolution of 4 \xadcm − 1 in transmittance mode in the wavenumber range of 4000–500 \xadcm − 1. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis was conducted using a Bruker Avance Neo 700 MHz NMR spectrophotometer with DMSO-d6 and \xadCDCl3 as solvents. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of PU-furan and PU-DA was performed using a Linseis STA instrument (STA PT1600) under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 °C min1 from 30 to 900 °C. The thermal behavior of PU-DA was assessed via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) using a Perkin Elmer DSC 8000 instru-ment in the temperature range of 0–190 °C. The heating and cooling rates were 20 °C/min, and all experiments were conducted under a protective nitrogen atmosphere. The melting temperature \xad(Tm) and entropy of fusion (ΔHm) data were collected during the second heating run. The density of the crosslinked polyurethanes (PUs) was determined using a pycnometer with distilled water as the immersion liquid. To assess the crosslink density of the samples, the degree of swelling, and gel content, the samples were measured. Samples 10 × 10x0.3 mm in size were immersed in 10 mL of toluene at room temperature in sealed containers for 24 h. Afterward, the film was washed with toluene and weighed to determine its mass \xad(ms). The films were subsequently sub-jected to drying at 35 °C initially under atmospheric pressure and then under vacuum, after which the weight of the dried film \xad(md) was recorded. The degree of swelling (Q) and gel content (G) were calculated using Eqs.

The sheet samples were intentionally scratched at a depth of 0.5 mm and then subjected to five dif-ferent heating treatments to observe their self-healing ability. The treatments involved heating at temperatures of 100 °C, 110 °C, 120 °C, and 130 °C for 10 min, heating at 130 °C  for 2 h, and cooling at 70 °C for 24 h. A quantitative study was conducted to evaluate the recovery of tensile strength following the self-healing process, utilizing a universal test-ing machine (Shimadzu AG–X Plus 50 kN). PU-DA samples were prepared as specimens according to ASTM D638 type 4, which were scratched in the center with a knife blade measuring 1 cm in length and 1 mm in depth. The self-healing process was then performed by heating the samples at 130 °C for 2 h, followed by a 24-h period at 70 °C. The self-healing efficiency was calculated based on the recovery of tensile strength using Eq. (3)', 'Healing Efficiency (% ) = Tensile strength healedTensile strength original × 100%.', '3 \x07Results and discussion', '3.1 \x07Synthesis of polyurethane Diels–Alder (PU‑DA)', 'The synthesis pathway of PU-DA is depicted in Fig. 1, and the reaction conditions are explained in Table 1. Initially, PEG was reacted with an excess PDI-trimer to obtain a prepolymer with isocyanates as the terminal functional groups. Because of the different reaction conditions applied during this step, the prepolymers were assumed to possess different properties, as observed during the reaction. The prepolymer was subsequently reacted with furfuryl amine (FA), resulting in the formation of furan-terminated polyurethane (PU-FA). The final product polyurethane Diels–Alder (PU-DA) was obtained through the Diels–Alder reaction between PU-FA and bismaleimide (BMI) at 80 °C, followed by solvent evaporation at 60 °C under vacuum. Structural analysis of polyethylene glycol (PEG), the PDI-trimer, PU-FA, and PU-DA was performed using 1H-NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 2).', 'The NMR spectrum of PU-FA (Fig. 2c) reveals the suc-cessful synthesis of the PU prepolymer and the subsequent incorporation of the furan group. The PU prepolymer struc-ture is revealed by the emergence of a carbamate bond (NH‒COO) peak at 3.41 ppm (c). The furan group attached to the prepolymer is distinguished by the presence of distinct furan ring peaks at 6.18 ppm (m), 6.37 ppm (n), and 7.55 ppm (o). Additionally, an amide group, which indicates the urethane or urea proton NH, was observed at 5.90 ppm (d, k). Further-more, the product of the PU-FA and BMI reactions (Fig. 2d), a Diels–Alder adduct, is characterized by notable proton shifts at 3.07 ppm (r), 5.18 ppm (q), and 6.42–6.59 ppm (p). The aromatic structure of BMI is indicated by peaks in the range of 7.26–7.35 ppm (s, t). Additionally, the characteris-tic methylene peak originating from BMI was identified at 3.9 ppm (u).', '@', '@', "The formation of the polyurethane prepolymer from the reaction between polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the pentamethylene diisocyanate (PDI) trimer was confirmed through FTIR spectroscopy, as depicted in Fig. 3 and S1. The FTIR spectrum reveals a characteristic absorption peak at 2270 cm⁻1, which corresponds to the stretching vibration of the isocyanate (NCO) group. This distinct peak serves as a definitive indicator of the presence of the polyurethane  prepolymer and remains detectable throughout the progression of the reaction, providing consistent evidence of the NCO group's role in the synthesis process. The ATR-FTIR spectra shown in Fig. 3 for the PU prepolymer, PU-FA, and PU-DA support the findings of the 1H NMR analysis. The lack of a peak at 2270 cm⁻1 in PU-FA confirms that the isocyanate group has reacted, indicating no residual isocyanate group remains. In contrast, the emergence  of peaks at 1012, 736, and 811 \xadcm−1 distinctly confirms the incorporation of a furan ring in PU–FA [31, 32]. Compared with PU-FA, PU-DA has an obvious shoulder peak at 1710 \xadcm−1, which is characteristic of the DA adduct (–C = O band of imide) [33]. Simultaneously, the intensity decreases at 1012, 811, and 736 \xadcm−1, stemming from the consumption of the furan ring by the BMI molecule (Fig. 3b). This reduction clearly indicates the success of the PU–FA reaction with BMI through the Diels–Alder reaction. DSC analyses of both the pristine PEG and PU-DA formulations were carried out over a temperature range of 0 °C to 190 °C. Figure 4a shows the DSC curve of pristine PEG, which shows distinct melting and crystallization peaks at 61.1 °C and 21.5 °C, respectively. In contrast, Fig. 4b shows that the endothermic peak (melting temperature) of PU-DA is generally lower than that of pristine PEG (61.1 °C). This difference results from the hindrance of multiple PEG crystalline segments as they interact during the formation of Diels–Alder cross-links, restricting their ability to organize into a well-defined crystalline structure. [34]. The cooling DSC curve (Fig. 4c) shows the reformation of PEG characterized by an exothermic peak. Owing to the inhibition of chain mobility by Diels–Alder crosslinks, PU-DA formulations tend to display higher crystallization temperatures than pristine PEG, indicating that recrystallization occurred earlier during cooling. Figure 4d shows the first and second heating–cooling cycles in the DSC thermogram of PU-DA formula 6. In the first heating cycle (black line), the thermogram of PU shows a modest endothermic peak between 110 and 150 °C, indicating the occurrence of a retro-DA reaction (release of furan and maleimide group bonds) [35]. Moreover, in the cooling curve (red line), a small exothermic peak at approximately 72 °C (as clearly shown in the inset photograph) suggests  the reformation of DA adduct bonds, which are possibly obscured by PEG recrystallization. Meanwhile, during the second heating cycle (blue line), the absence of the endothermic peak can be attributed to the insufficient interval between the two cycles, which prevented the complete reconstruction of the DA bonds. This inadequacy led to the peak not being discernible by DSC during the second heating cycle [36, 37].", '@', '@', '3.2 \x07Thermal characteristics and reversibility of Diels–Alder (DA) bonds', 'In Table 2, the melting enthalpies of the eight polyu-rethane Diels–Alder (PU-DA) formulations ranged from 25.5 to 134.5 J/g, while the crystallization enthalpies (ΔHc) ranged from 26.2 to 136.8 J/g. Compared to pristine PEG (ΔHm = 158.3 J/g, ΔHc = 137.0 J/g), the PU-DA formulation exhibits a lower melting and crystallization enthalpy, sug-gesting that the crystallization and melting of PEG segments are hindered. This reduction is attributed to the restricted molecular mobility imposed by Diels–Alder cross-linking, which limits the ability of PEG chains to organize into a well-defined crystalline structure [38]. The synthesis of PU-DA involved NCO/OH ratios of 1.5 and 3. Notably, the data in Table 2 indicate that an NCO/OH ratio of 3 resulted in lower melting and crystallization enthalpies than an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5. This difference may stem from the higher NCO/OH ratio, which intensifies the disruption of PEG crystalline segments as a result of increased Diels–Alder cross-link formation. Consequently, the restricted molecular mobility leads to lower melting and crystallization enthalp-ies compared to the sample with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5. This is further evidenced by the NCO/OH ratio of 3, which corresponds to a higher gel content value compared to the ratio of 1.5.', 'One advantage of intrinsic self-healing materials lies in the repeatability of their healing process, which stems from the reversibility of dynamic bonds. The thermal reversibility of Diels–Alder bonds further elucidate this mechanism. The thermal treatment of the PU-DA samples (Fig. 5a) and subsequent DSC measurements with consistent parameters revealed significant insights. In Fig. 5b, the observed peak (38–60 °C) indicates  the melting of PEG crystals within the Diels–Alder polyurethane matrix. The thermograms also revealed modest endothermic peaks, indicating the breakage of DA adducts from the original polymer synthesis  process (DA1) at 120 °C (sample F5-PUDA) and 140 °C (F6-PUDA). After heat treatment and cooling at 70 °C, DSC observations (Fig. 5c and Table S2) revealed decreased melting and crystallization enthalpies of PEG  in DA2 compared with those in DA1, which was attributed to the presence of DA2 bonds hindering the mobility of the PEG crystalline segments [39]. The decrease in enthalpies indicates Diels–Alder bond reconstruction during heating at 70 °C for 24 h. This phenomenon confirmed the reproducible thermal reversibility of the synthesized PU-DA samples.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Tm and \xadTc represent the melting/crystallization temperature, respectively; ΔHm and ΔHc represent the melt-ing/crystallization enthalpy, respectively, and the density (ρ), degree of swelling (Q), and gel content (G) were measured experimentally', '@', '@', 'Figure 6 shows the TGA and DTG curves of the Diels–Alder polyurethane sample under consistent heating conditions. The DTG curve reveals two distinct stages of thermal decomposition, marked by a minor peak in the initial stage and a substantial mass loss in the subsequent stage. The observed minor peak at approximately 160 °C likely arises from the evaporation of residual DMF within the material [40]. While the TGA curves of the PU-DA  series are similar, the polyurethane samples F2 and F8 exhibit lower thermal stability, which can be related to their lower gel contents. In this sample, the rapid formation of the PU prepolymer restricts the extent to which furan groups can react with the prepolymer. Consequently, furan groups face challenges in integrating into the maleimide structure, leading to decreased formation of Diels–Alder crosslinks.', '3.3 \x07Healing ability', 'The self-healing behaviors of the eight PU-DA samples were comprehensively assessed using qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The qualitative evaluation involved a scratch test to visually assess the material’s healing capacity, whereas quantitative analysis was performed  by determining the percentage of healing efficiency via hardness measurements. To qualitatively explore the healing process, the PU-DA film samples were subjected to five distinct heating treatments. The four treatments included heating the samples at temperatures ranging from 100 to 130 °C for 10 min each, followed by cooling to ambient temperature. The fifth treatment consisted of heating the sample at 130 °C for 2 h to promote the retro-Diels–Alder reaction, followed by heating at 70 °C for 24 h to facilitate the Diels–Alder reaction. The outcomes were evaluated using a digital microscope set at 100 × magnification. The results of the four thermal treatments are shown in Figure S2-S3, and the results of the fifth thermal treatment are shown in Fig. 8.', '@', '@', 'Polyurethane chains consist of soft segments derived from polyols and hard segments derived from isocyanates, with thermal energy influencing the mobility of these segments. Generally, soft segments exhibit greater mobility than hard segments upon heating, while hard segments restrict the thermal motion of molecular chains. Consequently, the self-healing capability of PU-DA is significantly influenced by the ratio of soft-to-hard segments, which can be controlled by adjusting the NCO/OH molar ratio. Observations from optical microscopy (Fig. 7) of the healing test conducted at 100 °C indicate that samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 (formulas F1–F4) exhibit faster scratch recovery compared to those with a ratio of 3 (formulas F5–F8). Similar trends were observed at 110, 120, and 130 °C (Figure S2.I-II and S3.III-IV), where samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5  demonstrated superior healing efficiency. This phenomenon can be attributed to the higher proportion of soft segments in the 1.5 ratio, which enhances the mobility of the PU chains, allowing PU-FA and BMI to reflow and fill cracks after heat treatment. Conversely, samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 contain fewer soft segments, restricting polymer chain mobility and impeding the healing process [41].', '@', '@', '@', '@', "The thermally induced self-healing property of PU-DA is linked to the dissociation and reformation of Diels–Alder (DA) bonds. The images below illustrate the response of the PU-DA samples to various temperature treatments, confirm-ing the reconstruction of the DA bonds in the crosslinked network under thermal stimulation. PU-DA film samples etched at the same position were heated at temperatures ranging from 100 to 130 °C for 10 min each. At 100 °C, most scratches remained visible, although slight healing at the scratch base was observed (Figure S2.I). At 110 °C, some PU-DA samples exhibited increased healing, although small scars from incomplete healing were still present (Fig-ure S2.II). Treatments at 120 °C and 130 °C (Figures S3. III-IV) resulted in significantly better healing responses than those at lower temperatures, with tightly closed cracks indi-cating a reversible reaction between the furan and maleimide groups on the PU-DA surface [34]. Wool and O'Connor’s theory posits that the polymer chain diffusion rate is cru-cial in controlling the healing speed during the crack heal-ing process [42]. The temperature significantly affected the diffusion rate. When heated, the scratched surface deforms back to its original position, bringing the separated surfaces into contact. Simultaneously, the retro-DA reaction acceler-ates chain interdiffusion between the crack surfaces after clo-sure, leading to successful healing [43]. The scratches on the PU-PA film disappeared completely after heating to 130 °C for 2 h (Figure S3). This heating caused fluidization, which  facilitated self-healing of the damaged area. Upon cooling to 70 °C, rebonding occurred, leading to the reconstruction of the Diels–Alder cross-linked network [44].", 'The quantitative evaluation of self-healing was conducted by measuring the recovery of tensile strength using a univer-sal testing machine (Shimadzu AG–X Plus 50kN). PU-DA samples were prepared by casting polymer films from a DMF solution, with dimensions of 17 cm in length, 16 cm in width, and a thickness ranging from 0.5 to 1 mm. The films were then subjected to solvent evaporation at 65 °C for 24 h. Specimens were prepared by punching the films according to the ASTM D638 type 4 standard, followed by introducing a scratch measuring 1 cm in length and 1 mm in depth at the center using a knife blade. The self-healing process was performed by heating the specimens at 130 °C for 2 h, and then maintaining them at 70 °C for 24 h. The healing efficiency was quantified based on the recovery of tensile strength, calculated using Eq. (3).', 'In this study, the self-healing behavior of PU-DA samples was evaluated using formulations with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 for the F5-F8 samples and 1.5 for the F1-F4 samples. Figure 8b presents the representative stress–strain curves of the original and healed PU-DA samples after being scratched. The corresponding values of tensile strength, elongation at break, and elastic modulus are shown in Fig. 8c–8e. The results from the tensile strength and elongation at break tests (Fig. 8c and 8d) indicate a distinct trend in healing performance, samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 exhibited a reduction in tensile strength and elongation at break after healing, whereas those with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 showed an increase in both properties following the healing process. Furthermore, the elastic modulus (Fig. 8e) increased in all PU-DA samples, regardless of the NCO/OH ratio. The evaluation of self-healing performance in  PU-DA samples revealed distinct differences in mechanical properties depending on the NCO/OH ratio used during synthesis. Specifically, PU-DA formulations with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 (Formulas F1–F5) exhibited a noticeable decline in tensile strength after the healing process when compared to PU-DA specimens that had not undergone thermal treatment. This reduction suggests that a lower cross-linking density may have limited the material’s ability to recover its original mechanical integrity. Conversely, PU-DA samples synthesized with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 (Formulas F5–F8) displayed a significant enhancement in healing efficiency, surpassing 100%. This remarkable self-healing capability is primarily attributed to the presence of a greater number of cross-links within the polymer network, which is directly correlated with the observed increase in gel content. The higher cross-link density not only facilitated more effective reformation of the molecular structure after damage but also contributed to improved tensile strength, exceeding that of the original PU-DA sample before healing. These findings highlight the critical role of cross-linking density in optimizing self-healing properties and mechanical robustness in thermally reversible polyurethane systems.', "The self-healing performance of PU-DA is governed by the synergistic effects of thermally induced polyurethane chain mobility and the thermo-reversible Diels–Alder (DA) reaction. Consequently, the self-healing capability of PU-DA is strongly influenced by the ratio of soft-to-hard segments, which can be controlled through the NCO/OH molar ratio. At an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5, the tensile strength after healing decreases compared to the original PU-DA sample (see Table 3). In contrast, when compared to a ratio of 3, both the pre- and post-healing tensile strength values are lower. This phenomenon can be attributed to the lower crosslink density, as indicated by the gel content, in PU-DA samples  with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 compared to those with a ratio of 3 (see Fig. 9f and Table S3). The reduced crosslink density in the 1.5 ratio results in lower tensile strength relative to the 3.0 ratio. At a higher hard-segment content (i.e., an NCO/OH ratio of 3), the formation of additional crosslinks between hard segments enhances structural integrity, requiring more energy to disrupt the network [45]. Self-healing efficiency is influenced by the polymer chain's ability to diffuse across the crack area and the availability of broken cross-links for reformation. These two factors exhibit an inverse relationship: as the cross-link density increases, chain diffusion is hindered, leading to a higher number of broken cross-links. At lower cross-linking levels, mechanical strength decreases. This phenomenon explains why the self-healing efficiency of the PU-DA sample with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 is lower compared to the ratio of 3, where the gel content is higher. Additionally, self-healing values exceeding 100%, which are attributed to the presence of cross-links reflected in the gel content, result in higher tensile strength than the original PU-DA sample [46, 47].", '4 \x07Conclusions', 'The behavior of the isocyanate trimer (PDI-trimer) in the synthesis of self-healing polyurethane (PU-DA) via the Diels–Alder (DA) reaction was investigated through the reaction between the furan-terminated prepolymer and bismaleimide. Digital microscopy and DSC observations revealed that cracks with a depth of 0.5 mm in the PU-DA film could be repaired after heat treatment at 120–130 °C for 10 min, achieving complete healing at 130 °C for 10 min, followed by cooling at 70 °C for 24 h. The tightly closed cracks indicate a reversible reaction between the furan and  maleimide groups on the surface of the PU-DA sample. Additionally, the DSC results revealed an endothermic peak in the PU-DA material (DA1), indicating the breakage of the Diels–Alder bond (r-DA). After cooling at 70 °C for 24 h, the endothermic peak remained visible (DA2), demonstrating the thermal reversibility of the synthesized PU-DA samples, which allows for repeated healing due to the reversibility of the Diels–Alder bond.', '@', '@', 'a A self-healing efficiency of 100% is attained when a PU-DA sample that undergoes a healing process—comprising heat treatment at 130 °C for 2 h followed by additional heating at 70 °C for 24 h—restores its tensile strength to the same level as the original, unhealed sample that has not undergone any thermal treatment. It is important to note that PU-DA1 refers to the pristine PU-DA sample, while PU-DA2 represents the healed PU-DA specimen', '@', '@', 'The NCO/OH ratio significantly influences the forma-tion of the furan‒maleimide crosslink bond structure. At a ratio of 3, the formation of PEG crystals is smaller than that at a ratio of 1.5, indicating that a higher ratio leads to more crosslink bonds and a decrease in the melting enthalpy value in DSC measurements. The healing efficiency of PU-DA samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 (Formulas F1-F5) showed a reduction in tensile strength compared to the unheated PU-DA specimens. In contrast, PU-DA sam-ples with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 (Formulas F5-F8) dem-onstrated enhanced healing efficiency, exceeding 100%, which can be attributed to the higher density of cross-links. This increased cross-linking, as reflected in the gel content, resulted in greater tensile strength than the original PU-DA sample. These findings provide valuable insights into the development of self-healing materials utilizing PDI-trimer via the Diels–Alder reaction, a relatively underexplored area in polymer research.', 'Supplementary Information The online version containssupplementary material available at https://\u200bdoi.\u200borg/\u200b10.\u200b1007/s13233-\u200b025-\u200b00400-y.', 'Acknowledgements This research was supported by the ResearchOrganization for Nanotechnology and Materials [National Researchand Innovation Agency of Indonesia (No. 3/III.10/HK/2023)] and theResearch Center for Polymer Technology.', 'Author contributions All authors contributed to the study conception and design.

The PU prepolymer is a reaction product of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and a pentamethylene diisocyanate trimer (PDI-t). Furfuryl amine was attached to the terminal isocyanic groups of PU, resulting in furfuryl amine polyurethane (PU-FA). PU-FA was cross-linked via dynamic bonds between the furan groups and BMI, generating reversible bonds with the material. This study explored reversible polymer networks under various thermal conditions, including different reaction parameters, prepolymer ratios, and healing temperatures, to evaluate the healing capabilities of these polymers. The results demonstrated that PU-DA exhibits thermal reversibility, as evidenced by the appearance of an endothermic peak in the DSC analysis, indicating bond cleavage via the retro-Diels–Alder (r-DA) reaction. This endothermic peak re-emerged after cooling at 70 °C for 24 h, further confirming the reversibility of the reac-tion. Additionally, crack healing in the PU-DA film was facilitated by the synergistic effects of the thermally reversible Diels–Alder reaction and the thermal mobility of molecular chains. The self-healing performance evaluation revealed that PU-DA samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 exhibited a reduction in tensile strength after healing compared to the original PU-DA specimens before heat treatment. Conversely, samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 demonstrated a healing efficiency exceeding 100%, attributed to the enhanced cross-link density, which contributed to a more robust network structure.', '@', '@', "In this study, self-healing Diels-Alder polyurethane (PU-DA) was successfully synthesized using PDI trimer. The findings confirmed that the material's healing mechanism is activated by the reversible interaction between furan and maleimide groups within PU-DA, enabling it to autonomously repair structural damage", 'Keywords Polyurethane · Prepolymer · Self-healing · Pentamethylene diisocyanate trimer · Diels–Alder', '1 Introduction', 'Polyurethane has profoundly improved the quality of modern life through its diverse applications across multiple  industries. It is integral in enhancing the performance and functionality of products in sectors, such as coatings, automotive, textiles, synthetic leather, electronics, construction materials, aerospace, and medicine. This  versatile material not only improves the durability and efficiency of these products but also contributes to advances in technology and quality of life [1–4]. In practical applications, polyurethane is susceptible to the development of small cracks due to factors, such as heat, mechanical stress, and exposure to chemicals. These microcracks can significantly reduce the service life of polyurethane and are often challenging to detect visually [5]. Inspired by the self-repair mechanisms observed in nature, scientists have engineered polymers with inherent self-healing capabilities within certain limits. Self-healing strategies can be broadly categorized as extrinsic or intrinsic [6]. Extrinsic self-healing involves the incorporation of a healing agent within a polymer matrix; however, this method lacks reusability, because the healing agent is depleted upon each use. With this method, no external stimuli are needed for healing to occur. Conversely, the intrinsic self-healing system enables repetitive healing across multiple cycles of damage, although most methods in this system require external stimuli to initiate the healing process. As a result, intrinsic self-healing materials have attracted increasing attention in recent years [7].', 'Intrinsic self-healing materials normally contain dynamic bonds or interactions that can be broken and reformed to heal the material. These bonds can be covalent or nonco-valent in nature. Covalent bonds are often used because of their high strength of the bonds. Some examples of these bonds are Diels–Alder, disulfide, radical interactions, and cyclic compounds [8, 9]. Numerous studies have been conducted to develop self-healing polyurethanes with Diels–Alder chemistry. Self-healing polyurethanes (SH-PU) via the Diels–Alder method mostly comprise isocyanic polyurethane (to differ from nonisocyanic polyurethane) and commonly employ two main approaches. The first method involves the incorporation of furan terminals into the PU prepolymer, which are subsequently crosslinked with bis-maleimide (BMI). The second method involves the prepa-ration of a PU prepolymer containing maleimide pendant groups, which consequently react with difunctional furan compounds to produce SH-PU [5].', 'For isocyanates, researchers prefer the use of aliphatic isocyanate trimers for polyurethane coatings, because they offer lower toxicity, enhanced thermal stability, superior mechanical properties, and increased weather resistance [10]. The use of isocyanate trimers in the synthesis of self-healing polyurethane via the Diels–Alder system is wide-spread among researchers, with isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) trimers being the most commonly used [11–13]. IPDI is a cycloaliphatic isocyanate with one ring structure, whereas the IPDI trimer comprises a structure with four rings. These rings make the obtained polyurethane more rigid than when the diisocyanate is fully aliphatic, while more flexible materials are needed. To fill this gap, the  entirely aliphatic hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and its trimers (HDI-t) were used. Researchers have used HDI-t to fabricate self-healing polymers [14–22]. To answer the demand for greener materials, the bio-based pentamethyl-ene diisocyanate and its trimer are already available in the market. Some researchers have employed pentamethylene diisocyanate trimers (PDI-t) in the synthesis of functional polyurethanes [23–25]. Most studies on self-healing polyu-rethanes primarily use the conventional isocyanates derived from fossil resources, such as 1,6-diisocyanatohexane (HDI), which does not align with the growing demand for more environmentally sustainable and eco-friendly materials [26, 27]. Despite its promising potential to improve cross-linking density and mechanical properties, the use of PDI-trimer derived from bio-based sources as an isocyanate has not been widely explored. In this study, we investigated the self-healing synthesis of PDI-trimer as an isocyanate through the Diels–Alder reaction method, focusing on the impact of the NCO/OH ratio on its thermal behavior, healing efficiency, and mechanical performance. A series of PU prepolymer formulations were synthesized from polyethylene glycol (PEG) and PDI-trimer (PDI-t) at different reaction times, temperatures, and NCO/OH ratios. These prepolymers were then reacted with furfuryl amine (FA) to yield PU-FA. Addi-tionally, self-healing polyurethane (SH-PU) was synthesized by cross-linking PU-FA with bismaleimide (BMI) via the Diels–Alder reaction. These experiments were performed to understand how the different synthesis conditions affect the mechanical properties and healing behavior of the end polymer products. The knowledge is expected to contribute to the development of green polyurethane, particularly for coating application.', '2 \x07Experimental', '2.1 \x07Materials', "Furfurylamine (99%, FA), 1,1'-(methylenedi-4,1-phenylene) bismaleimide (BMI), polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG), and dibutyltin dilaurate (95%, DBTDL) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Before polymerization, polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG) with a molecular weight of 4000 g/mol was dried in a vacuum oven at 120 °C for 2 h. The isocyanate trimer Desmodur® eco N7300 (pentamethylene diisocy-anate/PDI-t), with an NCO content of 21.9% and an equiva-lent weight of 195, was sourced directly from PT Covestro Indonesia without further purification. Dimethylformamide (DMF), which was used as the solvent in the procedure, was purchased from Merck. Polyurethane with a furan terminal (PU-FA) and self-healing polyurethane (PU-DA) were syn-thesized as described in the previous studies [11, 28]. The synthesis details are described in the supporting information. FTIR spectroscopy spectra were acquired using a Brucker Tensor 27 spectrometer via the attenuated total reflectance (ATR) method, which uses 64 scans with a resolution of 4 \xadcm − 1 in transmittance mode in the wavenumber range of 4000–500 \xadcm − 1. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis was conducted using a Bruker Avance Neo 700 MHz NMR spectrophotometer with DMSO-d6 and \xadCDCl3 as solvents. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of PU-furan and PU-DA was performed using a Linseis STA instrument (STA PT1600) under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 °C min1 from 30 to 900 °C. The thermal behavior of PU-DA was assessed via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) using a Perkin Elmer DSC 8000 instru-ment in the temperature range of 0–190 °C. The heating and cooling rates were 20 °C/min, and all experiments were conducted under a protective nitrogen atmosphere. The melting temperature \xad(Tm) and entropy of fusion (ΔHm) data were collected during the second heating run. The density of the crosslinked polyurethanes (PUs) was determined using a pycnometer with distilled water as the immersion liquid. To assess the crosslink density of the samples, the degree of swelling, and gel content, the samples were measured. Samples 10 × 10x0.3 mm in size were immersed in 10 mL of toluene at room temperature in sealed containers for 24 h. Afterward, the film was washed with toluene and weighed to determine its mass \xad(ms). The films were subsequently sub-jected to drying at 35 °C initially under atmospheric pressure and then under vacuum, after which the weight of the dried film \xad(md) was recorded. The degree of swelling (Q) and gel content (G) were calculated using Eqs. (1) and (2) [29, 30]", '2.2 \x07Characterization', 'Q = 1 + 휌1휌2( msmd −1).', 'Furthermore', 'G(%) = mdmiso × 100.', 'Here, ρ1 and ρ2 represent the densities of the solvent (tol-uene, ρ: 0.8669 g/cm3) and the PU polymer, respectively. The variable md corresponds to the post-extraction weight of the dried sample post-extraction, whereas \xadmiso denotes the isolated weight of the sample before the extraction process.', 'The self-healing capability of PU-DA was qualitatively assessed using a Hirox KH-7700 digital microscope to observe the mending process of cracks induced by blades on the sample surfaces. The sheet samples were intentionally scratched at a depth of 0.5 mm and then subjected to five dif-ferent heating treatments to observe their self-healing ability. The treatments involved heating at temperatures of 100 °C, 110 °C, 120 °C, and 130 °C for 10 min, heating at 130 °C  for 2 h, and cooling at 70 °C for 24 h. A quantitative study was conducted to evaluate the recovery of tensile strength following the self-healing process, utilizing a universal test-ing machine (Shimadzu AG–X Plus 50 kN). PU-DA samples were prepared as specimens according to ASTM D638 type 4, which were scratched in the center with a knife blade measuring 1 cm in length and 1 mm in depth. The self-healing process was then performed by heating the samples at 130 °C for 2 h, followed by a 24-h period at 70 °C. The self-healing efficiency was calculated based on the recovery of tensile strength using Eq. (3)', 'Healing Efficiency (% ) = Tensile strength healedTensile strength original × 100%.', '3 \x07Results and discussion', '3.1 \x07Synthesis of polyurethane Diels–Alder (PU‑DA)', 'The synthesis pathway of PU-DA is depicted in Fig. 1, and the reaction conditions are explained in Table 1. Initially, PEG was reacted with an excess PDI-trimer to obtain a prepolymer with isocyanates as the terminal functional groups. Because of the different reaction conditions applied during this step, the prepolymers were assumed to possess different properties, as observed during the reaction. The prepolymer was subsequently reacted with furfuryl amine (FA), resulting in the formation of furan-terminated polyurethane (PU-FA). The final product polyurethane Diels–Alder (PU-DA) was obtained through the Diels–Alder reaction between PU-FA and bismaleimide (BMI) at 80 °C, followed by solvent evaporation at 60 °C under vacuum. Structural analysis of polyethylene glycol (PEG), the PDI-trimer, PU-FA, and PU-DA was performed using 1H-NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 2).', 'The NMR spectrum of PU-FA (Fig. 2c) reveals the suc-cessful synthesis of the PU prepolymer and the subsequent incorporation of the furan group. The PU prepolymer struc-ture is revealed by the emergence of a carbamate bond (NH‒COO) peak at 3.41 ppm (c). The furan group attached to the prepolymer is distinguished by the presence of distinct furan ring peaks at 6.18 ppm (m), 6.37 ppm (n), and 7.55 ppm (o). Additionally, an amide group, which indicates the urethane or urea proton NH, was observed at 5.90 ppm (d, k). Further-more, the product of the PU-FA and BMI reactions (Fig. 2d), a Diels–Alder adduct, is characterized by notable proton shifts at 3.07 ppm (r), 5.18 ppm (q), and 6.42–6.59 ppm (p). The aromatic structure of BMI is indicated by peaks in the range of 7.26–7.35 ppm (s, t). Additionally, the characteris-tic methylene peak originating from BMI was identified at 3.9 ppm (u).', '@', '@', "The formation of the polyurethane prepolymer from the reaction between polyethylene glycol (PEG) and the pentamethylene diisocyanate (PDI) trimer was confirmed through FTIR spectroscopy, as depicted in Fig. 3 and S1. The FTIR spectrum reveals a characteristic absorption peak at 2270 cm⁻1, which corresponds to the stretching vibration of the isocyanate (NCO) group. This distinct peak serves as a definitive indicator of the presence of the polyurethane  prepolymer and remains detectable throughout the progression of the reaction, providing consistent evidence of the NCO group's role in the synthesis process. The ATR-FTIR spectra shown in Fig. 3 for the PU prepolymer, PU-FA, and PU-DA support the findings of the 1H NMR analysis. The lack of a peak at 2270 cm⁻1 in PU-FA confirms that the isocyanate group has reacted, indicating no residual isocyanate group remains. In contrast, the emergence  of peaks at 1012, 736, and 811 \xadcm−1 distinctly confirms the incorporation of a furan ring in PU–FA [31, 32]. Compared with PU-FA, PU-DA has an obvious shoulder peak at 1710 \xadcm−1, which is characteristic of the DA adduct (–C = O band of imide) [33]. Simultaneously, the intensity decreases at 1012, 811, and 736 \xadcm−1, stemming from the consumption of the furan ring by the BMI molecule (Fig. 3b). This reduction clearly indicates the success of the PU–FA reaction with BMI through the Diels–Alder reaction. DSC analyses of both the pristine PEG and PU-DA formulations were carried out over a temperature range of 0 °C to 190 °C. Figure 4a shows the DSC curve of pristine PEG, which shows distinct melting and crystallization peaks at 61.1 °C and 21.5 °C, respectively. In contrast, Fig. 4b shows that the endothermic peak (melting temperature) of PU-DA is generally lower than that of pristine PEG (61.1 °C). This difference results from the hindrance of multiple PEG crystalline segments as they interact during the formation of Diels–Alder cross-links, restricting their ability to organize into a well-defined crystalline structure. [34]. The cooling DSC curve (Fig. 4c) shows the reformation of PEG characterized by an exothermic peak. Owing to the inhibition of chain mobility by Diels–Alder crosslinks, PU-DA formulations tend to display higher crystallization temperatures than pristine PEG, indicating that recrystallization occurred earlier during cooling. Figure 4d shows the first and second heating–cooling cycles in the DSC thermogram of PU-DA formula 6. In the first heating cycle (black line), the thermogram of PU shows a modest endothermic peak between 110 and 150 °C, indicating the occurrence of a retro-DA reaction (release of furan and maleimide group bonds) [35]. Moreover, in the cooling curve (red line), a small exothermic peak at approximately 72 °C (as clearly shown in the inset photograph) suggests  the reformation of DA adduct bonds, which are possibly obscured by PEG recrystallization. Meanwhile, during the second heating cycle (blue line), the absence of the endothermic peak can be attributed to the insufficient interval between the two cycles, which prevented the complete reconstruction of the DA bonds. This inadequacy led to the peak not being discernible by DSC during the second heating cycle [36, 37].", '@', '@', '3.2 \x07Thermal characteristics and reversibility of Diels–Alder (DA) bonds', 'In Table 2, the melting enthalpies of the eight polyu-rethane Diels–Alder (PU-DA) formulations ranged from 25.5 to 134.5 J/g, while the crystallization enthalpies (ΔHc) ranged from 26.2 to 136.8 J/g. Compared to pristine PEG (ΔHm = 158.3 J/g, ΔHc = 137.0 J/g), the PU-DA formulation exhibits a lower melting and crystallization enthalpy, sug-gesting that the crystallization and melting of PEG segments are hindered. This reduction is attributed to the restricted molecular mobility imposed by Diels–Alder cross-linking, which limits the ability of PEG chains to organize into a well-defined crystalline structure [38]. The synthesis of PU-DA involved NCO/OH ratios of 1.5 and 3. Notably, the data in Table 2 indicate that an NCO/OH ratio of 3 resulted in lower melting and crystallization enthalpies than an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5. This difference may stem from the higher NCO/OH ratio, which intensifies the disruption of PEG crystalline segments as a result of increased Diels–Alder cross-link formation. Consequently, the restricted molecular mobility leads to lower melting and crystallization enthalp-ies compared to the sample with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5. This is further evidenced by the NCO/OH ratio of 3, which corresponds to a higher gel content value compared to the ratio of 1.5.', 'One advantage of intrinsic self-healing materials lies in the repeatability of their healing process, which stems from the reversibility of dynamic bonds. The thermal reversibility of Diels–Alder bonds further elucidate this mechanism. The thermal treatment of the PU-DA samples (Fig. 5a) and subsequent DSC measurements with consistent parameters revealed significant insights. In Fig. 5b, the observed peak (38–60 °C) indicates  the melting of PEG crystals within the Diels–Alder polyurethane matrix. The thermograms also revealed modest endothermic peaks, indicating the breakage of DA adducts from the original polymer synthesis  process (DA1) at 120 °C (sample F5-PUDA) and 140 °C (F6-PUDA). After heat treatment and cooling at 70 °C, DSC observations (Fig. 5c and Table S2) revealed decreased melting and crystallization enthalpies of PEG  in DA2 compared with those in DA1, which was attributed to the presence of DA2 bonds hindering the mobility of the PEG crystalline segments [39]. The decrease in enthalpies indicates Diels–Alder bond reconstruction during heating at 70 °C for 24 h. This phenomenon confirmed the reproducible thermal reversibility of the synthesized PU-DA samples.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Tm and \xadTc represent the melting/crystallization temperature, respectively; ΔHm and ΔHc represent the melt-ing/crystallization enthalpy, respectively, and the density (ρ), degree of swelling (Q), and gel content (G) were measured experimentally', '@', '@', 'Figure 6 shows the TGA and DTG curves of the Diels–Alder polyurethane sample under consistent heating conditions. The DTG curve reveals two distinct stages of thermal decomposition, marked by a minor peak in the initial stage and a substantial mass loss in the subsequent stage. The observed minor peak at approximately 160 °C likely arises from the evaporation of residual DMF within the material [40]. While the TGA curves of the PU-DA  series are similar, the polyurethane samples F2 and F8 exhibit lower thermal stability, which can be related to their lower gel contents. In this sample, the rapid formation of the PU prepolymer restricts the extent to which furan groups can react with the prepolymer. Consequently, furan groups face challenges in integrating into the maleimide structure, leading to decreased formation of Diels–Alder crosslinks.', '3.3 \x07Healing ability', 'The self-healing behaviors of the eight PU-DA samples were comprehensively assessed using qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The qualitative evaluation involved a scratch test to visually assess the material’s healing capacity, whereas quantitative analysis was performed  by determining the percentage of healing efficiency via hardness measurements. To qualitatively explore the healing process, the PU-DA film samples were subjected to five distinct heating treatments. The four treatments included heating the samples at temperatures ranging from 100 to 130 °C for 10 min each, followed by cooling to ambient temperature. The fifth treatment consisted of heating the sample at 130 °C for 2 h to promote the retro-Diels–Alder reaction, followed by heating at 70 °C for 24 h to facilitate the Diels–Alder reaction. The outcomes were evaluated using a digital microscope set at 100 × magnification. The results of the four thermal treatments are shown in Figure S2-S3, and the results of the fifth thermal treatment are shown in Fig. 8.', '@', '@', 'Polyurethane chains consist of soft segments derived from polyols and hard segments derived from isocyanates, with thermal energy influencing the mobility of these segments. Generally, soft segments exhibit greater mobility than hard segments upon heating, while hard segments restrict the thermal motion of molecular chains. Consequently, the self-healing capability of PU-DA is significantly influenced by the ratio of soft-to-hard segments, which can be controlled by adjusting the NCO/OH molar ratio. Observations from optical microscopy (Fig. 7) of the healing test conducted at 100 °C indicate that samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 (formulas F1–F4) exhibit faster scratch recovery compared to those with a ratio of 3 (formulas F5–F8). Similar trends were observed at 110, 120, and 130 °C (Figure S2.I-II and S3.III-IV), where samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5  demonstrated superior healing efficiency. This phenomenon can be attributed to the higher proportion of soft segments in the 1.5 ratio, which enhances the mobility of the PU chains, allowing PU-FA and BMI to reflow and fill cracks after heat treatment. Conversely, samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 contain fewer soft segments, restricting polymer chain mobility and impeding the healing process [41].', '@', '@', '@', '@', "The thermally induced self-healing property of PU-DA is linked to the dissociation and reformation of Diels–Alder (DA) bonds. The images below illustrate the response of the PU-DA samples to various temperature treatments, confirm-ing the reconstruction of the DA bonds in the crosslinked network under thermal stimulation. PU-DA film samples etched at the same position were heated at temperatures ranging from 100 to 130 °C for 10 min each. At 100 °C, most scratches remained visible, although slight healing at the scratch base was observed (Figure S2.I). At 110 °C, some PU-DA samples exhibited increased healing, although small scars from incomplete healing were still present (Fig-ure S2.II). Treatments at 120 °C and 130 °C (Figures S3. III-IV) resulted in significantly better healing responses than those at lower temperatures, with tightly closed cracks indi-cating a reversible reaction between the furan and maleimide groups on the PU-DA surface [34]. Wool and O'Connor’s theory posits that the polymer chain diffusion rate is cru-cial in controlling the healing speed during the crack heal-ing process [42]. The temperature significantly affected the diffusion rate. When heated, the scratched surface deforms back to its original position, bringing the separated surfaces into contact. Simultaneously, the retro-DA reaction acceler-ates chain interdiffusion between the crack surfaces after clo-sure, leading to successful healing [43]. The scratches on the PU-PA film disappeared completely after heating to 130 °C for 2 h (Figure S3). This heating caused fluidization, which  facilitated self-healing of the damaged area. Upon cooling to 70 °C, rebonding occurred, leading to the reconstruction of the Diels–Alder cross-linked network [44].", 'The quantitative evaluation of self-healing was conducted by measuring the recovery of tensile strength using a univer-sal testing machine (Shimadzu AG–X Plus 50kN). PU-DA samples were prepared by casting polymer films from a DMF solution, with dimensions of 17 cm in length, 16 cm in width, and a thickness ranging from 0.5 to 1 mm. The films were then subjected to solvent evaporation at 65 °C for 24 h. Specimens were prepared by punching the films according to the ASTM D638 type 4 standard, followed by introducing a scratch measuring 1 cm in length and 1 mm in depth at the center using a knife blade. The self-healing process was performed by heating the specimens at 130 °C for 2 h, and then maintaining them at 70 °C for 24 h. The healing efficiency was quantified based on the recovery of tensile strength, calculated using Eq. (3).', 'In this study, the self-healing behavior of PU-DA samples was evaluated using formulations with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 for the F5-F8 samples and 1.5 for the F1-F4 samples. Figure 8b presents the representative stress–strain curves of the original and healed PU-DA samples after being scratched. The corresponding values of tensile strength, elongation at break, and elastic modulus are shown in Fig. 8c–8e. The results from the tensile strength and elongation at break tests (Fig. 8c and 8d) indicate a distinct trend in healing performance, samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 exhibited a reduction in tensile strength and elongation at break after healing, whereas those with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 showed an increase in both properties following the healing process. Furthermore, the elastic modulus (Fig. 8e) increased in all PU-DA samples, regardless of the NCO/OH ratio. The evaluation of self-healing performance in  PU-DA samples revealed distinct differences in mechanical properties depending on the NCO/OH ratio used during synthesis. Specifically, PU-DA formulations with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 (Formulas F1–F5) exhibited a noticeable decline in tensile strength after the healing process when compared to PU-DA specimens that had not undergone thermal treatment. This reduction suggests that a lower cross-linking density may have limited the material’s ability to recover its original mechanical integrity. Conversely, PU-DA samples synthesized with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 (Formulas F5–F8) displayed a significant enhancement in healing efficiency, surpassing 100%. This remarkable self-healing capability is primarily attributed to the presence of a greater number of cross-links within the polymer network, which is directly correlated with the observed increase in gel content. The higher cross-link density not only facilitated more effective reformation of the molecular structure after damage but also contributed to improved tensile strength, exceeding that of the original PU-DA sample before healing. These findings highlight the critical role of cross-linking density in optimizing self-healing properties and mechanical robustness in thermally reversible polyurethane systems.', "The self-healing performance of PU-DA is governed by the synergistic effects of thermally induced polyurethane chain mobility and the thermo-reversible Diels–Alder (DA) reaction. Consequently, the self-healing capability of PU-DA is strongly influenced by the ratio of soft-to-hard segments, which can be controlled through the NCO/OH molar ratio. At an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5, the tensile strength after healing decreases compared to the original PU-DA sample (see Table 3). In contrast, when compared to a ratio of 3, both the pre- and post-healing tensile strength values are lower. This phenomenon can be attributed to the lower crosslink density, as indicated by the gel content, in PU-DA samples  with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 compared to those with a ratio of 3 (see Fig. 9f and Table S3). The reduced crosslink density in the 1.5 ratio results in lower tensile strength relative to the 3.0 ratio. At a higher hard-segment content (i.e., an NCO/OH ratio of 3), the formation of additional crosslinks between hard segments enhances structural integrity, requiring more energy to disrupt the network [45]. Self-healing efficiency is influenced by the polymer chain's ability to diffuse across the crack area and the availability of broken cross-links for reformation. These two factors exhibit an inverse relationship: as the cross-link density increases, chain diffusion is hindered, leading to a higher number of broken cross-links. At lower cross-linking levels, mechanical strength decreases. This phenomenon explains why the self-healing efficiency of the PU-DA sample with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 is lower compared to the ratio of 3, where the gel content is higher. Additionally, self-healing values exceeding 100%, which are attributed to the presence of cross-links reflected in the gel content, result in higher tensile strength than the original PU-DA sample [46, 47].", '4 \x07Conclusions', 'The behavior of the isocyanate trimer (PDI-trimer) in the synthesis of self-healing polyurethane (PU-DA) via the Diels–Alder (DA) reaction was investigated through the reaction between the furan-terminated prepolymer and bismaleimide. Digital microscopy and DSC observations revealed that cracks with a depth of 0.5 mm in the PU-DA film could be repaired after heat treatment at 120–130 °C for 10 min, achieving complete healing at 130 °C for 10 min, followed by cooling at 70 °C for 24 h. The tightly closed cracks indicate a reversible reaction between the furan and  maleimide groups on the surface of the PU-DA sample. Additionally, the DSC results revealed an endothermic peak in the PU-DA material (DA1), indicating the breakage of the Diels–Alder bond (r-DA). After cooling at 70 °C for 24 h, the endothermic peak remained visible (DA2), demonstrating the thermal reversibility of the synthesized PU-DA samples, which allows for repeated healing due to the reversibility of the Diels–Alder bond.', '@', '@', 'a A self-healing efficiency of 100% is attained when a PU-DA sample that undergoes a healing process—comprising heat treatment at 130 °C for 2 h followed by additional heating at 70 °C for 24 h—restores its tensile strength to the same level as the original, unhealed sample that has not undergone any thermal treatment. It is important to note that PU-DA1 refers to the pristine PU-DA sample, while PU-DA2 represents the healed PU-DA specimen', '@', '@', 'The NCO/OH ratio significantly influences the forma-tion of the furan‒maleimide crosslink bond structure. At a ratio of 3, the formation of PEG crystals is smaller than that at a ratio of 1.5, indicating that a higher ratio leads to more crosslink bonds and a decrease in the melting enthalpy value in DSC measurements. The healing efficiency of PU-DA samples with an NCO/OH ratio of 1.5 (Formulas F1-F5) showed a reduction in tensile strength compared to the unheated PU-DA specimens. In contrast, PU-DA sam-ples with an NCO/OH ratio of 3 (Formulas F5-F8) dem-onstrated enhanced healing efficiency, exceeding 100%, which can be attributed to the higher density of cross-links. This increased cross-linking, as reflected in the gel content, resulted in greater tensile strength than the original PU-DA sample.

2025-05-21 15:04:11 - WARNING: ['Crystallization kinetics, spherulitic growth and morphology  development in non‑polar polymer blend with strong  dynamic asymmetry', 'Nithin Chandran1,2 · C. Sarathchandran3 · Anjaly Sivadas1 · Robert A. Shanks4', 'Received: 27 December 2024 / Revised: 14 February 2025 / Accepted: 9 March 2025  © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025', 'Abstract', 'The crystallization kinetics, spherulitic growth rate and morphology development of a non-polar blend mixture [isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and natural rubber (NR)] with strong dynamic asymmetry are investigated comprehensively. Melt mixed samples of iPP and natural NR with different NR loading were subjected to ther-mal analysis using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric (TGA) followed by crystal growth using optical microscopy (OM). Prior to melt mixing, the NR samples were masticated for 30 min so as to reduce the molecular weight. Detailed evaluation of the kinetics of crystallization, growth rate of crystals, and morphology development in a dynamically asymmetric system is challenging especially when the second component is a semi-crystalline polymer and studies on such systems have not received significant attention.', 'Introduction', 'Mixing two or more polymers is a well-established approach for designing materials with specific end use [1]. Changes in inherent characteristics and processing conditions of the component polymers are the main factors that influence the ultimate properties of polymer blends. Morphology and thermal properties of individual polymers play a major role in the precise manipulation of the properties (mechanical, optical, electrical,  etc.), thereby leading to the successful development of polymer blends with a unique set of properties. The situation is far more challenging when one of the blend compo-nents is a semi-crystalline polymer due to several competing reactions, including phase separation, nucleation and crystal growth, ripening of crystal structure, etc. However, semi-crystalline polymers and their blends are quite extensively used in the automo-bile industry. Thereby, it is of industrial/academic interest to study the crystallization behavior of immiscible blend systems especially with dynamic asymmetry. This can be achieved by the addition of a high molecular weight additive to the semi-crystalline polymer matrix [2–4]. The influence of introducing low molecular weight additives [5–7] and fillers [8–10] have been extensively investigated. Even then, the effect of add-ing high molecular weight additives such as elastomers, block copolymers [11, 12] etc., to a semi-crystalline polymer matrix has not received significant attention.', 'The ease of processability, coupled with desirable characteristics/properties, makes polypropylene (iPP) an appealing thermoplastic for broad applications rang-ing from the automotive industry to biomedical industry [13] making it the best candidate for the present study. Even though the crystallization kinetics and mor-phology of iPP-based blends [14–19] and the influence of additives (especially those of low molecular weight) on the crystallization and morphology of semi-crystalline polymers have already been investigated [20, 21]. The influence of adding a high molecular weight polymer on segmental dynamics, crystallization kinetics and ther-mal stability remains unexplored and requires special attention. Rheological, mor-phological and mechanical properties of high molecular weight NR blended with PP have been extensively studied [22–24]. But an in-depth analysis of the thermal prop-erties of iPP-NR blends is not available especially, while using NR as a toughening agent. The very large difference in molecular weight between iPP and NR makes them a dynamically asymmetric system. Since the role of NR as a toughening agent for iPP was the main aim of present work, fillers were not used as this would inhibit the contribution of NR to morphology development and, in turn, mechanical proper-ties. The current manuscript ushers to provide fundamental insights into the crystal-lization kinetics, morphology development and thermal stability of a dynamic asym-metric blend with a semi-crystalline component.', 'The current research deals with subjecting the blends to different thermal his-tories to determine the glass transition temperature (Tg), melting temperature (Tm), and melting enthalpy (ΔHm) using DSC. Apart from these, isothermal crystalliza-tion experiments were carried out to determine the half-time of crystallization (t0.5) and the kinetic parameters, which include the Avrami exponent (n) and the overall rate of crystallization (K1/n). Besides, the spherulitic growth of the blend has been followed using polarizing optical microscopy (POM).', 'Experimental', 'Materials', 'iPP (Repol-H350 FG) was supplied by Reliance Industries Limited with melt flow index, (230 °C/2.16 kg) of 38 g/min and heat deflection temperature (455 kPa) of  104 °C. Natural rubber (ISNR-5) was obtained from Rubber Research Institute,India, Kottayam, with an average molecular weight of ~ 7,80,000 g \xadmol−1.', 'Blend preparation', 'iPP was dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 6 h. To improve mixing efficiency, the high viscosity NR was reduced by masticating it for 5 min in a two-roll mill with a nip clearance of 3 mm and a friction ratio of 1.25:1 (20/15 rpm, back roll/front roll). Blends with different blend ratios of iPP and NR (100–0, 90–10, 80–20, 70–30 60–40 and 50–50) were melt-mixed using a Brabender Plastocorder. The processing parameters, temperature, rotation per minute and time were fixed as 180 °C, 50 rpm and 10 min respectively.', 'Characterization techniques', 'Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)', 'Perkin-Elmer (Diamond series) DSC was used to study the crystallization and melt-ing behavior, while TA instruments DSC (Q 200) was used to study the Tg of the blends. Both DSCs were calibrated with indium standard under nitrogen atmosphere that was purged throughout the analysis to minimize thermo-oxidative degradation. Samples of weight 2–3 mg were used for each DSC experiment. The samples were exposed to different thermal histories:', '1.

The endothermic deviations obtained during the sec-ond heating cycle can be used to calculate the extent of cooperatively rearranging  regions (CRR) (ξ) for the iPP phase using Donth’s approximation (2) [25–27], whichplays a vital role in the evaluation of the crystallinity.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '휉=kT2gΔC−1p휌(훿T)2 ,', 'where ρ the density of bulk material, ΔCp−1 is the reciprocal specific heat at con-stant pressure and δT. The result obtained is shown in Fig. 2.', 'It can be observed that as the amount of NR increases, the ξ showed a gradual decrease which is in accordance with the morphology change observed using SEM. Gradual increases in the amount of NR result in a change from droplet-matrix to co-continuous type morphology. This is in exact correlation with calculated CRR values. In the case of the blend with 50%·w/w of NR, an increase in CRR can be observed due to phase inversion. The crystallization of a semi-crystalline polymer in a blend can be affected by its counterpart. Molecular structure and molecular weight of the components, blend composition, type and degree of dispersion for dif-ferent phases in the molten stage, phase interaction at the interface of the individ-ual homopolymers and crystallization conditions are some of the major factors that affect the crystallinity in the polymer. The crystallinity (χ) [28, 29] is given by,', '휒% =ΔHmΔH◦ m × Vf× 100,', 'where ΔHm and Vf are the enthalpy of fusion and volume fraction of iPP, respec-tively. The ΔH0m is the heat of fusion of 100% pure crystalline PP which was taken as iPP is 209 J·g−1. [30] The crystallinity increases with NR loading, reaches a maxi-mum of 30% w/w of NR and thereafter decreases (refer to Fig. 3). The decrease in ξ and increase in χ indicate that small fractions of NR aid the crystallization of iPP by serving as nucleating agents, and the amorphous fraction of iPP has weak van der Waal’s interaction with NR, with the interactions sensitive to NR loading. Figure 3 shows the melting curve for iPP–NR blend system (Table 2).', 'Endotherms for the second heating cycle were used to evaluate the melting behavior. This eliminates the influence of processing history on melting behavior. The melting temperature is almost the same in all blends (~ 163 °C). However, a small broadening of the melting peak can be observed, which may be due to the  melting of different-sized crystals or disordered crystals formed by the addition of NR.', '@', '@', 'The endotherm obtained for iPP-NR blends after crystallization at selected crys-tallization temperatures (Tc) was used to calculate the equilibrium melting tempera-ture (Tm°) using Hoffman–Weeks Eq. (4) [31–33],', 'Tm = Tc2훽+ T0 m[1 −12훽]', ' Here Tm is the melting temperature calculated at selected Tc and 훽= lcl∗c is the thick-ening factor that is greater than or equal to one. Plot of Tmº against blend composi-tion is shown in Fig. 4.', 'The trend for Tm° has wide implications for polymer blends. An increasing value for Tm° indicates that the crystalline fraction is compatible with the added amor-phous component. An increase in Tm° is rarely encountered. A decrease in Tm° indicates attractive interactions between the blend components. It can be observed from Fig. 4 that the Tm° for iPP–NR blend shows a decreasing trend indicating that the crystalline fraction of iPP is having an attractive interaction with NR. Figure 5 shows the crystallization of iPP–NR blend at a selected Tc of 130 °C.', 'It follows from Fig. 6 that the addition of NR influenced the crystallization of iPP, and the rate of crystallization increased with the addition of NR. The broad-ened exotherm of neat iPP sharpens with NR loading, indicating favorable inter-action between iPP and NR. Neat iPP requires more time to crystallize than that  of NR blended iPP, confirming the efficiency of NR as a nucleating agent. The isothermal crystallization studies were carried out to evaluate the crystallization kinetics for iPP–NR blends as a function of NR loading. The time taken for half the crystallinity to develop (t0.5) is recommended to remove the influence of the overall rate of crystallization on the phase boundaries of a heterogeneous system. Figure 6 shows a plot of t0.5 against Tc (124–132 °C) for iPP and iPP–NR blends.', '@', '@', 'The crystalline kinetics for polymeric materials can be best explained usingthe Avrami Eq.

KA1/n and n represent the over-all rate of crystallization and the Avrami exponent respectively (refer to Fig. 7). Table 2 shows the value of K and n obtained for the PP-NR blend at different Tcs.', 'The Avrami exponent n is expected to have integral values, where a value between 1 and 2 represents 1D crystal growth, values between 2 and 3 indicate 2D crystal growth, while values between 3 and 4 represent 3D crystal growth and above 4 indicate heterogeneous nucleation. iPP–NR blends show a value of n close to 3, indicating sporadic nucleation with 2 D crystal growth.

The reason for this is the change in morphology (from droplet-matrix type to co-continuous type), as discussed in the following section.', 'SEM analysis shows droplet-matrix type morphology with gradual change to co-continuous type as a function of NR loading, (50%·w/w NR loading onwards) as evidenced by the SEM images shown in Fig. 10.', 'Figure 11 displays the optical micrographs of spherulite growth at 130 °C at thecooling rate of 10 °C/min in neat iPP, and iPP–NR blend with magnification of 10X.', 'Figure 11a confirms the presence of a well-defined “Maltese cross [14]” coin-ciding with the principal axis of crystal and extinction direction of the polarizer/analyzer, indicating uniform crystal growth. Higher concentrations of NR exhibit co-continuous morphology, preventing the actual growth of iPP spherulites and disappearing Maltase cross for the spherulite developed in the iPP–NR 50–50 composition [37, 38]. For a better understanding, magnified images 10× are shown in Fig. 12.', 'Spherulite growth rate (G) can be evaluated from the slope of the radius versus time curve, and Fig. 13a shows the growth rate for iPP, calculated from POM images. Figure 13b displays the contribution of the blend ratio on G over a different temperature range (124–136 °C). The spherulite growth rate reveals a decreasing pattern with increasing content of NR, and it is prominent at lower crystallization temperatures.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'However, G is unaffected by the blend ratio at higher Tc. This can be due to the slower growth rate because of the high molecular mobility. TGA and DTA plots for iPP and iPP–NR blends are shown in Fig. 14a, b respectively.', 'The experiment was performed between temperature ranges of 30 to 700 °C. Fig-ure 14a shows that neat iPP has single-step degradation with high thermal stabil-ity (decomposition onset of 385 °C), while 50% of degradation occurs at 474 °C. With the addition of NR to the iPP matrix, a gradual decrement of onset of degra-dation reaching up to 308 °C can be observed (50%∙w/w of NR). It is noteworthy that blends of iPP–NR exhibit two degradation steps, indicating a highly immiscible system, which is obvious from the DTG curves (Fig. 3). Peak obtained in the range  of 350 to 400 °C represents the degradation of NR, while iPP degradation occurred at 450 to 500 °C.', '@', '@', 'Conclusion', 'The crystallization kinetics, spherulitic growth rate and melting properties of iPP blended with non-polar counterpart have been evaluated and correlated to blend morphology. The addition of NR to iPP produces a gradual change in morphology  from droplet-matrix to co-continuous type, and this resulted in a predominant con-tribution to the crystallization kinetics of iPP and the mutual interaction between the blend components. Decrease in Tm° with NR loading, point to the existence of weak attractive interactions between the blend components. This is also reflected in the spherulite growth rate. Even though the blending of iPP with other polymers has been studied and reported quite extensively, the effect of dynamic asymmetry on thermal properties and morphology development remains unexplored. Considering the commercial importance of iPP in various sectors, a detailed evaluation of the effect of molecular weight on thermal, mechanical and morphological properties is extremely important.
