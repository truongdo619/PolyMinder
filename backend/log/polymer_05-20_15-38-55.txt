2025-05-20 15:39:28 - WARNING: ['Advanced elasticity and biodegradability of bio‑based  copolyester elastomer achieved by the crystallization  inhibition of isosorbide and flexibility of 1,6‑hexanediol', 'Lisheng Tang1  · Xiaoyan He1  · Ran Huang1', 'Received: 8 July 2024 / Revised: 13 August 2024 / Accepted: 24 September 2024 /   Published online: 26 October 2024  © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024', 'Abstract', 'The stability to against hydrolysis while maintaining excellent elasticity is one of the most challenging problems in the development of biodegradable and environ-mental-friendly polyester elastomer. While monomers of longer chain can provide higher stability, the high crystallinity and rigidity impair their application in fabri-cating elastomer. This work reported a star-crosslinked poly(butanediol-hexanediol-isosorbitol-itaconate-sebacate) elastomer synthesized by esterification and thermal curing. With the crystallization inhibition effect of isosorbide as a large and rigid monomer, and the flexibility of 1,6-hexanediol, the rigid (butanediol-itaconate-seba-cate) copolyester system is successfully transformed from plastic to be elastomer with lower Tm and Tg, much higher elongation at break, and smaller tensile modulus, and the biodegradability is also improved. The strategy is demonstrated to be effi-cient and may serve as a potential technique in the future development of biodegrad-able elastomers.', 'Keywords Biodegradable · Copolyester elastomer · PBHIIS · Isosorbide ·Crystallization inhibition', 'Introduction', 'Because of its special qualities, elastomers—a type of polymer with a low modulus and high elasticity—can rapidly return to their initial form following the removal of an external force. Because of these qualities, they are indispensable in both daily life and the economy [1–4]. Elastomers have been the subject of ongoing research and development to improve their strength, stability, aging resistance, and wear resistance in order to fulfill the ever-increasing performance requirements. How-ever, these advantages make it harder to dispose of the waste products made from conventional elastomers, which pollutes the environment over time [5, 6]. However, the majority of elastomers are derived from poorly sustainable non-renewable fos-sil fuels. The creation of novel elastomers that are not dependent on fossil fuels has become highly demanded in recent times due to the immense strain imposed by car-bon emissions. Bio-based elastomers are a great way to reduce carbon emissions and conserve resources in the elastomer sector since they may be made from natural plants directly or by synthesizing them from bio-based monomers produced from biomass resources.', 'Due to excellent biodegradability, aliphatic polyester became a prominent area of research for environmentally-friendly products. Linear polyesters, such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA), polyglycolide acid (PGA), polycaprolactone (PCL), and their copol-ymers, have been extensively studied in the field of plastic for many years. And their industrial production is seeing tremendous growth [7–9]. Polyesters having a three-dimensional network have gained increasing interest, motivated by these lin-ear polymers [10, 11]. Like vulcanized rubber, the cross-linked network is formed by the incorporation of "star" monomers to create multi-branched chains, enabling the material to rapidly regain its shape when subjected to substantial deformation. Poly (glycerol sebacate) (PGS), polyoctyl citrate (POC), and their copolymers are the primary biodegradable polyester elastomers that have undergone substantial research. The pioneering work is the synthesis of PGS, an in-situ cross-linked poly-ester elastomer with a three-dimensional network structure and exceptional robust-ness, conducted by Langer et al. successfully synthesized in 2002 [10, 12]. In 2011, Zhang et al. firstly introduced chemically crosslinked polyester elastomer [13]. Sub-sequently, many other bio-based elastomers have been created [14, 15].', 'It is well known that monomers of longer chain are easier to be synthesized to be polyester with higher stability, due to the lower density of ester linkage. For exam-ple, PCL and PBS are commercially mature materials, which employ 4- or 6- car-bon chain monomer [16], while polyglycolide acid (PGA) with 2-carbon monomer is unstable to hydrolysis and its commercial application is very limited [17]. How-ever, on the other hand, when the goal of our research is to obtain elastomers, the high crystallinity and rigidity due to longer chains becomes a disadvantage. Hereby a technical difficulty arises, how to construct biodegradable polyester with decent stability, cross-linkage network, and sufficient elasticity? That is, we probably need longer chain monomers, multi-functional “star” monomer, and some component to lower the crystallinity.', 'In chemically crosslinked polyester elastomers, the glass transition temperature can be decreased and crystallization can be hindered by employing multicompo-nent copolymerization and including monomers with side groups, which in turn improves the elasticity [18, 19]. Particular monomers with side group, large vol-ume and/or rigid segment can play a crucial role in crystallization inhibition. Gao et al. [20] designed and synthesized biobased poly(1,4-butanediol/2,3-butanediol/succinic acid/iconocarboxylic acid) co-polyesters (PBBSI) with varying 2,3-butan-ediol content. The co-polyesters underwent a transformation from stiff plastics to flexible elastomers due to the alteration in the amount of 2,3-butanediol. Hu et al. [21] synthesized the elastomer poly(2,3-butanediol-co-1,4-butanediol-co-succinate) (PBBS) by introducing 2,3-butanedioic acid into PBS, whose elasticity can be there-after improved with the crystallization inhibition effect.', 'Isosorbide, as a bulky, rigid, and food and environment safe monomer, can be introduced into the copolyester for tuning the crystallization and thermal properties. Zhang et al. [22] reported a bio-based shape memory polymer for biomedical appli-cations, which employs butanediol, isosorbide, sebacate, and itaconate to achieve a series of cross-linked copolyesters with excellent shape-recovery property. However, this series of (PBISI) copolyesters were not elastomers in the room temperature. On the other hand, our group has focused on the development of biodegradable elasto-mers using the dual-crosslinking property of itaconic acid [19, 23]. Thus, it is inher-ently captivating to us that this system shall also possess exceptional potential to function as an elastomer with significant industrial utility. The absence of longer chain monomers with greater flexibility may be the crucial factor for elasticity.', 'In this work, we select sebacic acid, itaconic acid, butanediol, and hexanediol to synthesize stable copolyesters, with sebacic acid as the long-chain monomer, ita-conic acid as the chemically crosslinking site, and two diols, butanediol and hex-anediol, to reduce the regularity of the copolyester. Isosorbide is then introduced to the copolyester to prepare the biodegradable elastomer as PBHIIS. Linear chains of this two copolyesters are synthesized as so-called pre-PBHI(I)S, and a final ther-mal curing with initiator benzoyl peroxide (BPO) vulcanized the linear chains to be structural network. The scheme of this work is illustrated in Fig. 1. The chemical structure, thermal and mechanical properties, and biodegradability of the final prod-ucts were characterized.', 'Experimental', 'Reagents and materials', 'Itaconic acid (analytic grade), hexanediol (analytic grade), and butanediol (analytic grade) are purchased from Shandong Yousuo Chemical Technology Co., Ltd, China; isosorbide (analytic grade), sebacic acid (analytic grade), and methylhydroquinone (analytic grade) are purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd.

Additionally, polymerization inhibitors comprising of 0.05 wt.% methylhydroqui-none and 0.02 wt.% hydroquinone are added. The resulting mixture is then placed in an oil bath and heated to a temperature of 140 ℃ to facilitate melting. Mechani-cal stirring and nitrogen environment for protection are employed during the entire esterification, while gradually raising the temperature. The reaction proceeds 1 h each time the temperature increases by 10  ℃ within the range of 140 ℃–180 ℃, for a total duration of 5 h. Subsequently, evacuate the system gradually raise the tem-perature while operating under lower pressure to facilitate the condensation reac-tion.

The prepolymer is subjected to repeated dissolution flocculation using a mixture of dichloromethane and metha-nol, which effectively eliminates impurity. Additionally, the majority of the solvent is eliminated through the process of rotary evaporation. Subsequently, the substance is introduced into a vacuum oven set at a temperature of 50 ℃, where it undergoes vacuum drying until the solvent is entirely eliminated.', 'The initiator BPO of 1 wt.% is added into the prepolymers and subject it to a cur-ing process at a temperature of 130 ℃ for a duration of 20 min. We prepared three sets of polyester elastomers with varying percentages of isosorbitol components. Table 1 displays the molar ratios of the three combinations of raw ingredients and the corresponding names of the polyester elastomers.', 'Characterization', 'Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis was carried out to determine the number-average molecular weight (Mn), weight-average molecular weight (Mw) and poly dispersity index (PDI) (PL-GPC220, Agilent Technologies, USA).

About 5–8 mg of the samples were placed into alumina crucibles and heated to 100 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min and kept for 5 min to eliminate previous thermal history, followed by cooling down to -50 °C and finally heating to 100 °C at a cooling/ heating rate of 10 °C/min.', 'The biodegradability of the PBH(I)S was characterized by composting accordingthe EN ISO standard [24].', 'Results and discussion', 'Chemical structure', 'The molecular weight of pre-polymer significantly influences the structure and prop-erties of the final cured product. Gel permeation chromatography is employed to examine the molecular weight of the prepolymers. The Mn, Mw, and PDI of pre-PBHI(I)S are summarized in Table 2. Note that all the synthesis were undertaken with the identical device, procedure and operator, therefore the significant difference of molecular weight among PBHIS and PBHIIS mainly reflects the synthesizabil-ity of themselves. And it accords to our expectation that large and rigid isosorbide cause a harder chain formation with lower Mn and Mw, and PBHIIS4 exhibits a bit higher molecular weight than PBHIIS2, but these two are in comparable level and can be considered as trivial difference.', '@', '@', 'Figure 2a shows the FTIR spectra of PBHIIS2 before and after curing, due to the presence of unsaturated itaconic acid, the peak of C = C stretching vibration is located at 1650 \xadcm−1. Moreover, it can be seen from the figure that the intensity of the C = C peak located near 1650 \xadcm−1 of the cured PBHIIS2 decreases sig-nificantly, which indicates that the C = C on the molecular chain acts as a reaction site for cross-linking during the curing. Figure 2b is the FTIR spectrum of various PBHI(I)S. The presence of an absorption peak representing ester carbonyl C = O near 1730 \xadcm−1 proves the occurrence of esterification, which results in the gen-eration of ester bonds in the molecular structure. The peak of ether bond C–O–C near 1095 \xadcm−1 is enhanced significantly from PBHIS to PBHIIS4, which obvi-ously agrees with the factor that only isosorbide contains C–O–C bond among all the monomers.', 'The chemical structure of pre-PBHI(I)S is further characterized using 1H NMR spectroscopy. The 1H NMR spectrum of pre-PBHI(I)S is shown in Fig. 3. Typical signals can be observed at 6.36 ppm, 5.75 ppm and 3.38 ppm corresponding to the \xadHm, \xadHm’ and \xadHn of the itaconic acid-based units, which indicates that the pendent double bonds, –C(= \xadCH2)–, can still be well preserved after the esterification and condensation reaction due to the inhibitory effect of the polymerization inhibitor. The peaks at 5.22 ppm, 5.18 ppm, 4.86 ppm and 4.51 ppm correspond to the \xadHa, \xadHa’, \xadHb and \xadHc of isosorbitol units. The peaks between 4.00 ppm to 4.30 ppm repre-sent the \xadHj and \xadHo of –CH2– in butanediol and hexanediol units. The peaks can be detected at 2.32 ppm corresponding to the \xadHf of the sebacic acid units. According to the results of 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 3a–c), the molar ratios of each unit are calcu-lated and listed in Fig. 3d. It indicates that the isosorbide component of raw mate-rial is increased, and the isosorbide segment in the synthesized molecular chain also increases. This further supports the above FTIR characterizations.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Thermal and mechanical property', 'The DSC results of various PBHI(I)S are shown in Fig. 4. The thermal properties such as glass transition temperature (Tg, °C), melting temperature (Tm, °C), melt-ing enthalpy (ΔHm, J/g), crystallization temperature (Tc, °C), and crystallization enthalpy (ΔHc, J/g) are summarized in Table 3. The Tg of PBHIIS exhibits a pro-gressive rise as the isosorbide concentration rise. This can be attributed to the incor-poration of rigid molecule isosorbide, which hinders the movement of the polyes-ter molecular chain. Nevertheless, the Tc and ΔHc of PBHIIS gradually decrease as the content of isosorbitol increases. This suggests that the presence of the cyclic structure of isosorbitol hindered the orderly arrangement of polyester molecular chains, thereby inhibiting the crystallization ability of PBHIIS. The Tg, Tm, and Tc of PBHIIS4 are lower than room temperature (25 °C). Therefore, PBHIIS4 exhibits a high elasticity at room temperature.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The mechanical properties of polyester elastomers are evaluated by tensile test. The stress–strain curves of various PBHI(I)S at room temperature are shown in Fig. 5, and the mechanical properties are summarized in Table 4. The PBHIS exhibits a notable tensile strength of 12.5 MPa and undergoes an obvious “necking” phenomenon dur-ing the tensile process, characterized by irreversible plastic deformation. The PBHIIS2 exhibits a crystallization temperature below room temperature, while its melting tem-perature surpasses room temperature. The polyester possesses excellent ductility due to the presence of a number of random molecular chains. Additionally, a small portion of crystals act as physical crosslinking agents, enhancing the material’s strength and elon-gation at break. PBHIIS2 has both exceptional tensile strength and remarkable elonga-tion at the point of fracture due to the presence of physical cross-linking and reinforce-ment from a limited number of crystals. The PBHIIS4 is a fully disordered polymer that does not form crystals at normal room temperature, and its stress–strain curves exhibit almost linear behavior. In the case of PBHIIS, the strength and modulus of the material decline dramatically as the amount of isosorbide rises. However, the elonga-tion at break grows significantly, with PBHIIS4 even reaching an elongation at break of 846.8%. This suggests that both the composition of monomers with side groups and the specific type of monomers with side groups are important factors in determining the mechanical properties of copolyesters. In particular, isosorbide as monomer is an excel-lent option for regulating the mechanical properties of polyester elastomers.', '@', '@', 'Biodegradability', 'Figure 6 shows the histogram of the degradation weight loss of PBHI(I)S with degrada-tion time at 50 °C and in a compost bin. From the degradation weight loss histograms, it can be seen that all the polyester elastomers synthesized in this work have excellent biodegradable properties, and almost all of them can be completely degraded in about 1 month. The degradation rate is relatively slow in the pre-composting stage probably due to factors such as microbial attachment, and the degradation occurred more and more rapidly as the polyester elastomers are gradually exposed to more degradable sites with the passage of time. The addition of isosorbide increases the hydrophilic-ity of PBHIIS, making it more susceptible to water and microbial "attack" and easier to degrade. The hydrolysable ester bonds in copolyester elastomers are responsible for their excellent biodegradability, and the degradation rate of copolyester elastomers can be modulated to a certain extent by the amount and type of monomers used in the syn-thesis system.', '@', '@', 'Conclusion', 'Biodegradable polyester elastomers, PBHIIS, were successfully prepared from bio-based dibasic acids and diols by direct melt polycondensation and introduc-ing the large and rigid monomer isosorbide to reduce the chemical and geometri-cal regularity of the molecular chain.', 'By adjusting the molar ratios of the isosorbide monomer, it was found that, with the increase in the amount of the side group-containing monomers, the crys-tallization of the polyesters gradually weakened, the deformation of the poly-esters in the tensile process shifted from mainly plastic to elastic deformation, and there was a tendency to accelerate the rate of the polyester’s biodegradation. Comparing to PBHIS and PBHIIS2, the PBHIIS4 has a Tm (24.53 °C) close to room temperature, and a significant elongation at break of 846.8%, which is more than 11 times of the PBHIS. These findings certified that the isosorbide is a suc-cessful component in developing polyester elastomers and we hope it may serve as potential tool in the future research.', 'Acknowledgements The National Key Research and Development Program China (2022YFC2009500), Guangdong Provincial Science and Technology Program (2023A0505050146), the Medical Engineering Fund of Fudan University (yg2022-008).', 'Author contributions R.H. supervised and coordinated project; R.H. and L.T. designed research; L.T. performed research; L.T., and X.H. analyzed data; R.H., X.H. and L.T. acquired funding and resource; and R.H. and L.T. wrote paper.', 'Data availability The main data generated or analyzed to support the conclusion during this study are included in this published article.

And polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared through radical polymerization of 1-vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface-vinylated nanoparticles. The polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were utilized as a functional additive to prepare PPBI/polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. Imida-zole and sulfonated vinylbenzene groups on the surface of modified nanoparticles forming linkages with PPBI chains, improved the compatibility between PPBI and nanoparticles, and enhanced the mechanical strength of the prepared nanocomposite membranes. The prepared nanocomposite membranes showed higher water uptake and acid doping levels comparing to PPBI. Also, after acid doping with phosphoric acid, nanocomposite membranes exhibited enhanced proton conductivity in comparison to the pristine PPBI and PPBI/un-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. The enhancement in proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes resulted from modified SiO2 nanoparticles showed higher conductivity than modified TiO2 nanoparticles. The above results indicated that the PPBI/modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for medium temperature fuel cells.', '© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang- ers [1–3]. Sulfonated polysulfone (PSF) [4], polyetheretherketone (PEEK) [5,6] and polybenzimidazoles (PBIs) [7–11] are among poly-mers which can be used as alternatives for Nafion in PEFCs.', 'Amongpolybenzimidazolederivatives,poly[2,2-5,5(m-phenylene)-bibenzimidazole](PBI),whichisalsocalled commercial polybenzimidazole have been used as a mem-brane material in PEMFCs. Having high chemical as well as thermal resistance and proton conductivity, polybenzimidazoles are great options to be used in the fuel cells with function at elevated temperatures above 100 ◦C [12].', 'PBIs should have enough proton conductivity so that it could be used as proton exchange membranes in the fuel cells. To achieve this purpose, they are usually doped with a sufficient acid like H3PO4 to an appropriate doping level [13]. Nanocomposite membranes are a new group of membranes which contain nanopar-ticles such as SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 and other compounds [14–21]. The introduction of nanoparticles into the membranes results in a considerable improvement in their features like mechani-cal properties, methanol permeability, but in some cases leads to a decrease in proton conductivity [22–24]. In order to over-come this problem, surface functionalized nanoparticles, which means various compounds with polar groups grafted chemically to the surface of the nanoparticles [25–28], were used. As men-tioned before, the numerous research works were done concerning grafting various compounds on the SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles which used for different purposes. However, in this work, we have used monomer bearing functional groups like imidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene which can improve the properties of pro-ton conductive membranes. These monomers are polymerized on the surface of the nanoparticles and as a consequence, they can more affect the properties of the membranes than while one functional group is grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. In addition, the polymerization of the selected monomers such as vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface of nanoparticle could cause more compatibility between nanopar-ticles and polymer matrix which finally improve the mechanical properties. In this work, nanocomposite membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles and newly synthesized polybenzimidazole was depicted poly[2,2-5,5-(m-pyrazolidene)-bibenzimidazole] (PPBI). Modification of the mentioned nanoparticles was performed by radical polymerization of some vinyl monomers such as sulfonated styrene and vinylim-idazole on the surface of the nanoparticles to which vinylic group was bounded covalently. Also, the effect of surface modification on the properties of the nanocomposite membranes such as pro-ton conductivity, mechanical properties and water uptake were studied.', '@', '@', '2.

The absence of absorbent peak related to amine group proton (N–H) in the area of 4.0–5.0 ppm and an absorbent related to amide group in the area of 10.3–10.6 ppm show the complete closure of imidazole rings during the polycondensation reaction.', 'In FT-IR characteristics of PPBI, the presence of absorbent bands in 800 cm−1 is related to the vibration of C–H bond of imida-zole, a band in about 1300 cm−1 is related to the vibration of C–N bond of imidazole, the absorbent band in 1450 cm−1 is related to C N and C C vibrations and bands in the area of 3400 cm−1 and 3140 cm−1 are related to N–H vibrations. All the above absorbent bands confirm the synthesis of PPBI.

The presence of the absorbent bands in 3050 cm−1 and 3100 cm−1 can be related to aromatic C–H bonds and also the existence of bands in the area of 2950 cm−1 can be attributed to aliphatic C–H bonds. Also the peaks in 1619 and 1419 cm−1 can be due to C C and C N bonds. In Fig. 4(c), the presence of the absorbent band in 1257 cm−1 is cor-responded to S O bond of the sulfonic acid group. These prove the existence of polymeric chains that are grafted onto the nanoparticle surface.', 'FT-IR spectra of the modified nanoparticles have been measured after complete washing and drying. To be sure of the chemical bonding of all chains (not physical) onto the particle surface, some un-modified nanoparticles were mixed with polymeric solutions of PVI and PSV and were stirred for 1 h. After filtration, the washing method used to wash the modified nanoparticles, was applied to the resulting powder as well. The FT-IR spectrum of the obtained powder did not show any absorbent bands related to PVI and PSV chains. The absorbent bands, which existed in the spectrum of mod-ified nanoparticles, were not observed in this spectrum. So, it was indicated that the polymeric chains have been attached to the par-ticles surface via covalent bonds.', '3.2. Thermal analysis', 'Thermogravimetric analysis diagrams of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 5. Weight loss in 85 ◦C can be related to the release of physically absorbed water. In un-modified nanoparticles, the minor weight loss in elevated temperatures can be attributed to the loss of hydroxyl groups of the particle surface attached by covalent bonds. Weight loss in modified nanoparticles could be a result of thermal degradation of the polymeric chains grafted to the surface of the nanoparti-cles. Also, the weight loss in 230–300 ◦C was due to the thermal decomposition of the sulfonate groups in the grafted PSV chains [30].', 'Thermograms of PVI modified nanocomposite with 5, 10 and 15% of TiO2 are shown in Fig. 6. As it is observed, the thermal prop-erties of the nanocomposites prepared with various amounts of TiO2 are almost similar. For this reason, in order to compare the thermal properties of other nanocomposites which prepared with modified nanoparticles having different monomers, only the TGA thermograms of nanocomposite containing of 10% (between 5% and 15%) modified nanoparticles are reported.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The remaining weight percentage in 850 ◦C is related to the modified TiO2 that is less than the added amount of PVI-modified TiO2 nanoparticles when the membrane was prepared. This decrease in weight in comparison with the theoretical amount could be related due to the degradation of the chains grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. Also, in order to obtain the par-ticular weight of the modified nanoparticles, specific amounts of modified and un-modified nanoparticles were weighed after and before complete burning out all the polymers. They were heated to temperatures about 1000 ◦C for 30 min and the obtained nanoparti-cles were weighed immediately. The difference between the weight of un-modified nanoparticles before and after heating shows the amount of lost water which was either physically absorbed or pro-duced from the condensation reaction of the hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticle surface. Also from the difference between the weight of modified nanoparticles before and after heating and consider- ing the weight of lost water, the percentage of the grafted polymer onto the nanoparticle surface was obtained. The obtained results and theoretical amounts are shown in Table 1. The amounts of the obtained results in all cases are more than theoretical values. This could be related to the presence of free water molecules and hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticles surface in which their values are not subtracted from theoretical values.', '@', '@', 'The diagrams of thermogravimetric analysis of both PPBI and nanocomposites prepared from the modified nanoparticles (10% w/w) are shown in Fig. 7. The weight loss observed in the tempera-ture range of 50–140 ◦C is a result of the release of water adsorbed into the membranes which is less significant in nanocomposites in comparison to pure membrane.', 'The second loss in weight, observed at the temperature range of 500–530 ◦C, is also attributed to the thermal degradation of poly-meric backbone of the nanocomposite membranes which is almost identical to the degradation temperature of pure PPBI. As a result, the addition of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles do not have any noticeable effect on thermal stability of the prepared nanocomposites.', 'As it is observed in Fig. 7, the degradation of PVI-modified nanoparticles occurs at 185 ◦C which is lower than the related tem-perature of PSV-modified ones. Therefore, the former one can be used in fuel cells with performance under 150 ◦C, but PSV-modified membrane is more suitable in high temperature fuel cells.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '3.3. Water uptake and doping level', 'Water uptake amount of nanocomposite membranes contain-ing 5, 10 and 15% of modified nanoparticles at 25 ◦C are shown in Fig. 8. Addition of silica nanoparticles to PPBI membranes increased their water uptakes due to the hygroscopic nature of SiO2 and TiO2nanoparticles. The sulfonic and imidazole groups in the nanopar-ticles increased the water uptake to a greater extent. The amount of water uptake for PPBI/TiO2-PSV, PPBI/SiO2-PSV, PPBI/TiO2-PVI and PPBI/SiO2-PVI are 21.6, 22.7, 20.4 and 21.9%, respectively. The effect of sulfonic acid groups of PSV chains grafted onto the nanoparticle surface on the water uptake is more than imidazole groups in PVI chains due to the higher hygroscopic properties of PSV comparing to PVI chains grafted on to the silica nanopar-ticle surface. The water uptake of PPBI/SiO2-PSV is higher than PPBI/TiO2-PSV which can be due to the further increase of the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles in comparison to TiO2 nanoparticle surface.', 'The PPBI-based membranes were doped with 85% H3PO4 to prepare the acid-doped membranes. Fig. 9 shows the acid-doping levels of the PPBI-based nanocomposite membranes. Acid-doping level (H3PO4 molecules per PPBI repeating unit) of pristine PPBI membrane was 13.5, which decreased to 11.8 for PPBI/SiO2, 12.0 for PPBI/SiO2-PSV, 11.7 for PPBI/TiO2 and 12.2 for PPBI/TiO2-PSV with 10% nanoparticle content and increased to 15.8 for PPBI/SiO2-PVI and 15.2 for PPBI/TiO2-PVI. Some of the amino groups in PPBI chains were blocked with the sulfonic acid groups of TiO2-PSV and SiO2-PSV, to decrease the binding ability of PPBI chains to H3PO4molecules.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Among the prepared nanocomposites, the water uptake in PPBI/SiO2-PSV and acid doping in PPBI/SiO2-PVI were the most one. Even in the comparison of these membranes with the simi-lar ones which prepared from modified TiO2 such as PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, the amount of water uptake and doping level were higher. This shows that using modified SiO2 nanoparticles in fuel cells is more appropriate.', '3.4. Proton conductivity', 'The membrane was sandwiched between two stainless steel electrodes and pressed together by clamp. Then, the MEA (Mem-brane Electrolyte Assembly) was inputted in the steam autoclave equipped with temperature controller. For measurement of pro-ton conductivity, the steam autoclave supplied with steam from a house generator for exposure to saturated steam at desired temperature. As an example, for saturated steam the pressure cor-responding to 120 ◦C is 205 kPa. The time of exposure to saturated steam at 120 ◦C was 30 min that this value for temperature of 140 ◦C was increased to 50 min.', 'Fig. 10 shows the Nyquist plot and equivalent circuit of studied membranes at 25 ◦C and RH 100% for some membranes.', 'After fitting the EIS experimental data on the electrical equiv-alent circuit, the membrane proton conductivity was determined from the intercept of EIS data with real impedance Z′ axis (as the value of Rm element). In equivalent circuit, Rm presents the resis-tance of the polymer film between the two metallic electrodes toward charge carriers (i.e. H+). L1 presents the stray inductance of the setup wires. CPE1 presents the non-ideal double layer capac-itance of the film/metal electrode interface. Rct and W0 show the charge transfer resistance of the (possible) reactions at the film/metal electrode interface and the diffusion processes through the polymers film, respectively. The proton conductivities of the phosphoric acid-doped PPBI based nanocomposite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 11) at 100% relative humidity were presented as a function of temperatures up to 80 ◦C. The pro-ton conductivities of all membranes increased with increasing the operation temperature up to 80 ◦C. Addition of the un-modified nanoparticles showed a negative effect on the proton conductivities of nanocomposite membranes. Similar trends were also reported to other nanocomposite membranes like Nafion®/silica membranes and PBI/silica membranes [31].', '@', '@', 'On the other hand, comparing the pristine PPBI and Nafion®117 membranes, the relatively high proton conductivities of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles are noteworthy [32]. Li et al. have used sulfonated organosilica to modify Nafion® membranes and they found that the proton con-ductivities of the modified membranes were still lower than that of the neat Nafion® membrane.', 'The reduction in the proton conductivity was attributed to the silica-induced changes in the tortuous paths and in the dis-tribution of hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains. However, in this work an enhancing effect on the proton conductivity was observed with addition of PSV and PVI grafted nanoparticles to PPBI mem-brane. The sulfonic and imidazole groups of modified nanoparticles also contribute in the acid-doping effect to PPBI polymer so as to enhance the proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles. Moreover, the presence of modified nanoparticles induces proton conductive pathways lead-ing to an increase in the proton conductivities of PPBI/modified nanoparticles membranes [24].', 'The proton conductivities of the acid-doped nanocompos-ite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 12) were further studied at high temperatures under an anhydrous environment. All the PPBI/modified nanoparticle membranes still exhibited higher proton conductivities than the pristine acid-doped PPBI membrane.', '@', '@', 'Generally, two principle mechanisms of vehicle mechanism and Grotthuss mechanism (hopping) describe proton diffusion through the membrane [33]. It is possible that the bounded water par-ticipates by the Grotthuss mechanism, and the free water takes part mostly by vehicle mechanism [34]. Addition of silica-SO3H to the membranes increases the bounded water content in the membranes (Fig. 13). The bounded water facilitates the proton transport ability through the Grotthuss mechanism, originating by generation of a continuous proton conductive pathway. There-fore, the high proton conductivity of PPBI/modified nanoparticles can be attributed to the high bounded water content in the membrane.', 'Since the Grotthuss-type diffusion mechanism without assis-tance of the vehicle mechanism has been proposed for the protonconductionunderanhydrousenvironments[35,36], theprotonconductivityoftheacid-dopedPPBI/modified nanoparticlemembranescouldbesynergisticallyresulted from their modified nanoparticle contents and the acid-doping levels.', 'Consequently, the highest proton conductivity was obtained withtheacid-dopedPPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%membraneathigh humidity and low temperatures and PPBI/SiO2-PVI-15% mem-brane in high temperatures and low humidity, which possesses the moderate modified nanoparticles content and acid-doping level.', 'As it is seen in Fig. 9, either we use PSV-modified or un-modified nanoparticles, the increase in the amount of the nanoparticles leads to a decrease in the acid doping level, but when PVI-modified nanoparticles were used, doping level increased. Also, according to Fig. 8, water uptake of the membrane shows an increase when using higher amounts of modified nanoparticles. This increase in PSV-modified nanocomposite membranesishigherinPVI-modified one. Proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PSV-modified nanoparticles shows significant increase in comparison to PVI-modified ones in low temperature and high rel-ative humidity. But in high temperature and low relative humidity, proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PVI-modified nanoparticles is observed to be more than PSV-modified ones and even at 145 ◦C the proton conductivity of PPBI/SiO2-PVI 15% is more than PPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%. The exis-tence of modified nanoparticles in PPBI nanocomposite membranes results in high proton conductivity in three ways:', '@', '@', '1) With increase in water uptake 2) With increase in the amount of doping level and 3) With increase in the number of proton conductive functional groups such as sulfonic acid group.', 'In PSV-modified nanocomposite membranes, acid doping decreases while the water uptake and the number of sulfonic acid groups shows an increase. Consequently, high proton conductiv-ity can be a result of these changes. It should be mentioned that in temperatures higher than 100 ◦C and in very low relative humidity, water uptake of PSV-modified membranes decreases which leads to low efficiency of the sulfonic groups attached onto the surface of the nanoparticles which in turn results in a decrease in proton conduc-tivity in both membranes, but the increase in proton conductivity resulting from high doping level is significant and also the proton conductivity of PVI-modified nanocomposite membranes increase in high temperatures.', 'It is noteworthy that Nafion® 117 shows relatively low pro-ton conductivities under anhydrous conditions and almost lacks its proton conductivities at high temperatures. Comparing to Nafion®117 membranes, the high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicate that this membrane could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', '3.5. Mechanical properties', 'The mechanical properties of the PPBI-based membranes were measured. The stress–strain curves are shown in Fig. 14. Pristine PPBI membrane showed an elongation at break of 38%. Mod-ification of nanocomposites with SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles results in an increase in the tensile strengths and a subse-quent decrease in the elongations at break for the PPBI-based membranes. For PPBI/modified nanoparticles nanocomposites membranes (PPBI/modified nanocomposite consists of the PPBI and surface-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles by PVI and PSV chains and PPBI/unmodified nanocomposite includes PPBI and SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles without any treatment), the presence of ionic linkages between PPBI and silica particles can be assigned to their high Young’s modulus. Introduction of modified and un-modified nanoparticles increases the brittleness of the nanocomposite mem-branes with a decrease in their elongations at break. The effects of modified and unmodified nanoparticles on the elongations at break of the nanocomposite membranes were different. The decrease in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness were widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inorganic reinforcement [37–39]. Moreover, the ionic linkages in nanocomposite membranes prepared from modi-fied nanoparticles are higher than hydrogen bonding in PPBI/SiO2and PPBI/TiO2.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The brittleness of PPBI/TiO2 based nanocomposite membranes is higher than PPBI/SiO2 ones. The brittleness of membranes pre-pared from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI are less than PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV membranes which are perhaps due to more com-patibility of PVI grafted chains onto the nanoparticles surface with PPBI backbone.', 'Comparing the brittleness of the nanocomposite membranes of the PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/SiO2-PVI with PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, respectively indicates that the brittleness of the membranes prepared with modified SiO2 nanoparticles is less than the modified TiO2 ones.', '3.6.

Also the major amounts of nanoparticles size are in the range of nanoscale and the bigger parti-cles as evidence for the formation of aggregations are not observed. The size of the TiO2-PSV particles are about 25–40 nm and the size of particles on the surface of the nanocomposite are determined to be 30–60 nm.', 'Fig. 16(a) shows the SEM micrographs of the modified SiO2nanoparticles. If the interactions between silica nanoparticles are stronger than that of between PPBI molecules and silica nanoparticles, the silica nanoparticles are agglomerated together to form silica domains in micrometer sizes. The compatibility between PPBI and unmodified nanoparticles and the homogene-ity of the PPBI/SiO2 or PPBI/TiO2 membranes are somewhat poor [32].', 'However, the dispersion homogeneity of silica nanoparticles in PPBI membranes could be significantly improved with using surface modified nanoparticles as the additives. As shown in Fig. 16(b), the dispersion homogeneity of modified nanoparticles is observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2 nanocomposite membrane, which demonstrates high compatibility between PPBI polymer and PSV-SiO2 nanoparticles and the high dispersion abil-ity of PSV-SiO2 in PPBI matrix. Particle agglomeration is still not observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2-10%. The ionic linkages between PPBI and modified nanoparticles are contributed to their higher compatibility [32]. However, in nanocompos-ite membranes prepared from un-modified SiO2 nanoparticles, thedispersionofthenanoparticlesinpolymermatrixis not homogenous and probably aggregation has been formed (Fig. 16(c)).', '@', '@', '4. Conclusion', 'The nanocomposite PPBI-based membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified and un-modified TiO2 and SiO2nanoparticles. The thermal stability of the prepared nanocompos- ite membranes was similar to PPBI membrane. The water uptake of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from TiO2/PSV and SiO2/PSV nanoparticles were higher than other nanocomposite membranes. The acid doping level and proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes in dry conditions obtained from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI nanoparticles were the highest in comparison to PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV. Formation of nanocomposites with modified and un-modified nanoparticles resulted the increas-ing of tensile strengths. The decreasing in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness was widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inor-ganic reinforcement. The high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicated that this membrane could be utilized as a proton exchange membrane for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. M.-G.

The polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were utilized as a functional additive to prepare PPBI/polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. Imida-zole and sulfonated vinylbenzene groups on the surface of modified nanoparticles forming linkages with PPBI chains, improved the compatibility between PPBI and nanoparticles, and enhanced the mechanical strength of the prepared nanocomposite membranes. The prepared nanocomposite membranes showed higher water uptake and acid doping levels comparing to PPBI. Also, after acid doping with phosphoric acid, nanocomposite membranes exhibited enhanced proton conductivity in comparison to the pristine PPBI and PPBI/un-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. The enhancement in proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes resulted from modified SiO2 nanoparticles showed higher conductivity than modified TiO2 nanoparticles. The above results indicated that the PPBI/modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for medium temperature fuel cells.', '© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang- ers [1–3]. Sulfonated polysulfone (PSF) [4], polyetheretherketone (PEEK) [5,6] and polybenzimidazoles (PBIs) [7–11] are among poly-mers which can be used as alternatives for Nafion in PEFCs.', 'Amongpolybenzimidazolederivatives,poly[2,2-5,5(m-phenylene)-bibenzimidazole](PBI),whichisalsocalled commercial polybenzimidazole have been used as a mem-brane material in PEMFCs. Having high chemical as well as thermal resistance and proton conductivity, polybenzimidazoles are great options to be used in the fuel cells with function at elevated temperatures above 100 ◦C [12].', 'PBIs should have enough proton conductivity so that it could be used as proton exchange membranes in the fuel cells. To achieve this purpose, they are usually doped with a sufficient acid like H3PO4 to an appropriate doping level [13]. Nanocomposite membranes are a new group of membranes which contain nanopar-ticles such as SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 and other compounds [14–21]. The introduction of nanoparticles into the membranes results in a considerable improvement in their features like mechani-cal properties, methanol permeability, but in some cases leads to a decrease in proton conductivity [22–24]. In order to over-come this problem, surface functionalized nanoparticles, which means various compounds with polar groups grafted chemically to the surface of the nanoparticles [25–28], were used. As men-tioned before, the numerous research works were done concerning grafting various compounds on the SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles which used for different purposes. However, in this work, we have used monomer bearing functional groups like imidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene which can improve the properties of pro-ton conductive membranes. These monomers are polymerized on the surface of the nanoparticles and as a consequence, they can more affect the properties of the membranes than while one functional group is grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. In addition, the polymerization of the selected monomers such as vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface of nanoparticle could cause more compatibility between nanopar-ticles and polymer matrix which finally improve the mechanical properties. In this work, nanocomposite membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles and newly synthesized polybenzimidazole was depicted poly[2,2-5,5-(m-pyrazolidene)-bibenzimidazole] (PPBI). Modification of the mentioned nanoparticles was performed by radical polymerization of some vinyl monomers such as sulfonated styrene and vinylim-idazole on the surface of the nanoparticles to which vinylic group was bounded covalently. Also, the effect of surface modification on the properties of the nanocomposite membranes such as pro-ton conductivity, mechanical properties and water uptake were studied.', '@', '@', '2.

The absence of absorbent peak related to amine group proton (N–H) in the area of 4.0–5.0 ppm and an absorbent related to amide group in the area of 10.3–10.6 ppm show the complete closure of imidazole rings during the polycondensation reaction.', 'In FT-IR characteristics of PPBI, the presence of absorbent bands in 800 cm−1 is related to the vibration of C–H bond of imida-zole, a band in about 1300 cm−1 is related to the vibration of C–N bond of imidazole, the absorbent band in 1450 cm−1 is related to C N and C C vibrations and bands in the area of 3400 cm−1 and 3140 cm−1 are related to N–H vibrations. All the above absorbent bands confirm the synthesis of PPBI. Furthermore, the absence of the absorbent band related to the carbonyl group in the vicinity of 1760 cm−1 can be confirmed as an evidence of the completion of cyclization reaction.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The FT-IR spectra of modified and un-modified SiO2 nanoparti-cles are shown in Fig. 4(a and b, c), respectively. The presence of the absorbent bands in 3050 cm−1 and 3100 cm−1 can be related to aromatic C–H bonds and also the existence of bands in the area of 2950 cm−1 can be attributed to aliphatic C–H bonds. Also the peaks in 1619 and 1419 cm−1 can be due to C C and C N bonds. In Fig. 4(c), the presence of the absorbent band in 1257 cm−1 is cor-responded to S O bond of the sulfonic acid group. These prove the existence of polymeric chains that are grafted onto the nanoparticle surface.', 'FT-IR spectra of the modified nanoparticles have been measured after complete washing and drying. To be sure of the chemical bonding of all chains (not physical) onto the particle surface, some un-modified nanoparticles were mixed with polymeric solutions of PVI and PSV and were stirred for 1 h. After filtration, the washing method used to wash the modified nanoparticles, was applied to the resulting powder as well. The FT-IR spectrum of the obtained powder did not show any absorbent bands related to PVI and PSV chains. The absorbent bands, which existed in the spectrum of mod-ified nanoparticles, were not observed in this spectrum. So, it was indicated that the polymeric chains have been attached to the par-ticles surface via covalent bonds.', '3.2. Thermal analysis', 'Thermogravimetric analysis diagrams of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 5. Weight loss in 85 ◦C can be related to the release of physically absorbed water. In un-modified nanoparticles, the minor weight loss in elevated temperatures can be attributed to the loss of hydroxyl groups of the particle surface attached by covalent bonds. Weight loss in modified nanoparticles could be a result of thermal degradation of the polymeric chains grafted to the surface of the nanoparti-cles. Also, the weight loss in 230–300 ◦C was due to the thermal decomposition of the sulfonate groups in the grafted PSV chains [30].', 'Thermograms of PVI modified nanocomposite with 5, 10 and 15% of TiO2 are shown in Fig. 6. As it is observed, the thermal prop-erties of the nanocomposites prepared with various amounts of TiO2 are almost similar. For this reason, in order to compare the thermal properties of other nanocomposites which prepared with modified nanoparticles having different monomers, only the TGA thermograms of nanocomposite containing of 10% (between 5% and 15%) modified nanoparticles are reported.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The remaining weight percentage in 850 ◦C is related to the modified TiO2 that is less than the added amount of PVI-modified TiO2 nanoparticles when the membrane was prepared. This decrease in weight in comparison with the theoretical amount could be related due to the degradation of the chains grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. Also, in order to obtain the par-ticular weight of the modified nanoparticles, specific amounts of modified and un-modified nanoparticles were weighed after and before complete burning out all the polymers. They were heated to temperatures about 1000 ◦C for 30 min and the obtained nanoparti-cles were weighed immediately. The difference between the weight of un-modified nanoparticles before and after heating shows the amount of lost water which was either physically absorbed or pro-duced from the condensation reaction of the hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticle surface. Also from the difference between the weight of modified nanoparticles before and after heating and consider- ing the weight of lost water, the percentage of the grafted polymer onto the nanoparticle surface was obtained. The obtained results and theoretical amounts are shown in Table 1. The amounts of the obtained results in all cases are more than theoretical values. This could be related to the presence of free water molecules and hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticles surface in which their values are not subtracted from theoretical values.', '@', '@', 'The diagrams of thermogravimetric analysis of both PPBI and nanocomposites prepared from the modified nanoparticles (10% w/w) are shown in Fig. 7. The weight loss observed in the tempera-ture range of 50–140 ◦C is a result of the release of water adsorbed into the membranes which is less significant in nanocomposites in comparison to pure membrane.', 'The second loss in weight, observed at the temperature range of 500–530 ◦C, is also attributed to the thermal degradation of poly-meric backbone of the nanocomposite membranes which is almost identical to the degradation temperature of pure PPBI. As a result, the addition of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles do not have any noticeable effect on thermal stability of the prepared nanocomposites.', 'As it is observed in Fig. 7, the degradation of PVI-modified nanoparticles occurs at 185 ◦C which is lower than the related tem-perature of PSV-modified ones. Therefore, the former one can be used in fuel cells with performance under 150 ◦C, but PSV-modified membrane is more suitable in high temperature fuel cells.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '3.3. Water uptake and doping level', 'Water uptake amount of nanocomposite membranes contain-ing 5, 10 and 15% of modified nanoparticles at 25 ◦C are shown in Fig. 8. Addition of silica nanoparticles to PPBI membranes increased their water uptakes due to the hygroscopic nature of SiO2 and TiO2nanoparticles. The sulfonic and imidazole groups in the nanopar-ticles increased the water uptake to a greater extent. The amount of water uptake for PPBI/TiO2-PSV, PPBI/SiO2-PSV, PPBI/TiO2-PVI and PPBI/SiO2-PVI are 21.6, 22.7, 20.4 and 21.9%, respectively. The effect of sulfonic acid groups of PSV chains grafted onto the nanoparticle surface on the water uptake is more than imidazole groups in PVI chains due to the higher hygroscopic properties of PSV comparing to PVI chains grafted on to the silica nanopar-ticle surface. The water uptake of PPBI/SiO2-PSV is higher than PPBI/TiO2-PSV which can be due to the further increase of the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles in comparison to TiO2 nanoparticle surface.', 'The PPBI-based membranes were doped with 85% H3PO4 to prepare the acid-doped membranes. Fig. 9 shows the acid-doping levels of the PPBI-based nanocomposite membranes. Acid-doping level (H3PO4 molecules per PPBI repeating unit) of pristine PPBI membrane was 13.5, which decreased to 11.8 for PPBI/SiO2, 12.0 for PPBI/SiO2-PSV, 11.7 for PPBI/TiO2 and 12.2 for PPBI/TiO2-PSV with 10% nanoparticle content and increased to 15.8 for PPBI/SiO2-PVI and 15.2 for PPBI/TiO2-PVI. Some of the amino groups in PPBI chains were blocked with the sulfonic acid groups of TiO2-PSV and SiO2-PSV, to decrease the binding ability of PPBI chains to H3PO4molecules.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Among the prepared nanocomposites, the water uptake in PPBI/SiO2-PSV and acid doping in PPBI/SiO2-PVI were the most one. Even in the comparison of these membranes with the simi-lar ones which prepared from modified TiO2 such as PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, the amount of water uptake and doping level were higher. This shows that using modified SiO2 nanoparticles in fuel cells is more appropriate.', '3.4. Proton conductivity', 'The membrane was sandwiched between two stainless steel electrodes and pressed together by clamp. Then, the MEA (Mem-brane Electrolyte Assembly) was inputted in the steam autoclave equipped with temperature controller. For measurement of pro-ton conductivity, the steam autoclave supplied with steam from a house generator for exposure to saturated steam at desired temperature. As an example, for saturated steam the pressure cor-responding to 120 ◦C is 205 kPa. The time of exposure to saturated steam at 120 ◦C was 30 min that this value for temperature of 140 ◦C was increased to 50 min.', 'Fig. 10 shows the Nyquist plot and equivalent circuit of studied membranes at 25 ◦C and RH 100% for some membranes.', 'After fitting the EIS experimental data on the electrical equiv-alent circuit, the membrane proton conductivity was determined from the intercept of EIS data with real impedance Z′ axis (as the value of Rm element). In equivalent circuit, Rm presents the resis-tance of the polymer film between the two metallic electrodes toward charge carriers (i.e. H+). L1 presents the stray inductance of the setup wires. CPE1 presents the non-ideal double layer capac-itance of the film/metal electrode interface. Rct and W0 show the charge transfer resistance of the (possible) reactions at the film/metal electrode interface and the diffusion processes through the polymers film, respectively. The proton conductivities of the phosphoric acid-doped PPBI based nanocomposite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 11) at 100% relative humidity were presented as a function of temperatures up to 80 ◦C. The pro-ton conductivities of all membranes increased with increasing the operation temperature up to 80 ◦C. Addition of the un-modified nanoparticles showed a negative effect on the proton conductivities of nanocomposite membranes. Similar trends were also reported to other nanocomposite membranes like Nafion®/silica membranes and PBI/silica membranes [31].', '@', '@', 'On the other hand, comparing the pristine PPBI and Nafion®117 membranes, the relatively high proton conductivities of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles are noteworthy [32]. Li et al. have used sulfonated organosilica to modify Nafion® membranes and they found that the proton con-ductivities of the modified membranes were still lower than that of the neat Nafion® membrane.', 'The reduction in the proton conductivity was attributed to the silica-induced changes in the tortuous paths and in the dis-tribution of hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains. However, in this work an enhancing effect on the proton conductivity was observed with addition of PSV and PVI grafted nanoparticles to PPBI mem-brane. The sulfonic and imidazole groups of modified nanoparticles also contribute in the acid-doping effect to PPBI polymer so as to enhance the proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles. Moreover, the presence of modified nanoparticles induces proton conductive pathways lead-ing to an increase in the proton conductivities of PPBI/modified nanoparticles membranes [24].', 'The proton conductivities of the acid-doped nanocompos-ite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 12) were further studied at high temperatures under an anhydrous environment. All the PPBI/modified nanoparticle membranes still exhibited higher proton conductivities than the pristine acid-doped PPBI membrane.', '@', '@', 'Generally, two principle mechanisms of vehicle mechanism and Grotthuss mechanism (hopping) describe proton diffusion through the membrane [33]. It is possible that the bounded water par-ticipates by the Grotthuss mechanism, and the free water takes part mostly by vehicle mechanism [34]. Addition of silica-SO3H to the membranes increases the bounded water content in the membranes (Fig. 13). The bounded water facilitates the proton transport ability through the Grotthuss mechanism, originating by generation of a continuous proton conductive pathway. There-fore, the high proton conductivity of PPBI/modified nanoparticles can be attributed to the high bounded water content in the membrane.', 'Since the Grotthuss-type diffusion mechanism without assis-tance of the vehicle mechanism has been proposed for the protonconductionunderanhydrousenvironments[35,36], theprotonconductivityoftheacid-dopedPPBI/modified nanoparticlemembranescouldbesynergisticallyresulted from their modified nanoparticle contents and the acid-doping levels.', 'Consequently, the highest proton conductivity was obtained withtheacid-dopedPPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%membraneathigh humidity and low temperatures and PPBI/SiO2-PVI-15% mem-brane in high temperatures and low humidity, which possesses the moderate modified nanoparticles content and acid-doping level.', 'As it is seen in Fig. 9, either we use PSV-modified or un-modified nanoparticles, the increase in the amount of the nanoparticles leads to a decrease in the acid doping level, but when PVI-modified nanoparticles were used, doping level increased. Also, according to Fig. 8, water uptake of the membrane shows an increase when using higher amounts of modified nanoparticles. This increase in PSV-modified nanocomposite membranesishigherinPVI-modified one. Proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PSV-modified nanoparticles shows significant increase in comparison to PVI-modified ones in low temperature and high rel-ative humidity. But in high temperature and low relative humidity, proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PVI-modified nanoparticles is observed to be more than PSV-modified ones and even at 145 ◦C the proton conductivity of PPBI/SiO2-PVI 15% is more than PPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%. The exis-tence of modified nanoparticles in PPBI nanocomposite membranes results in high proton conductivity in three ways:', '@', '@', '1) With increase in water uptake 2) With increase in the amount of doping level and 3) With increase in the number of proton conductive functional groups such as sulfonic acid group.', 'In PSV-modified nanocomposite membranes, acid doping decreases while the water uptake and the number of sulfonic acid groups shows an increase. Consequently, high proton conductiv-ity can be a result of these changes. It should be mentioned that in temperatures higher than 100 ◦C and in very low relative humidity, water uptake of PSV-modified membranes decreases which leads to low efficiency of the sulfonic groups attached onto the surface of the nanoparticles which in turn results in a decrease in proton conduc-tivity in both membranes, but the increase in proton conductivity resulting from high doping level is significant and also the proton conductivity of PVI-modified nanocomposite membranes increase in high temperatures.', 'It is noteworthy that Nafion® 117 shows relatively low pro-ton conductivities under anhydrous conditions and almost lacks its proton conductivities at high temperatures. Comparing to Nafion®117 membranes, the high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicate that this membrane could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', '3.5. Mechanical properties', 'The mechanical properties of the PPBI-based membranes were measured. The stress–strain curves are shown in Fig. 14. Pristine PPBI membrane showed an elongation at break of 38%. Mod-ification of nanocomposites with SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles results in an increase in the tensile strengths and a subse-quent decrease in the elongations at break for the PPBI-based membranes. For PPBI/modified nanoparticles nanocomposites membranes (PPBI/modified nanocomposite consists of the PPBI and surface-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles by PVI and PSV chains and PPBI/unmodified nanocomposite includes PPBI and SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles without any treatment), the presence of ionic linkages between PPBI and silica particles can be assigned to their high Young’s modulus. Introduction of modified and un-modified nanoparticles increases the brittleness of the nanocomposite mem-branes with a decrease in their elongations at break. The effects of modified and unmodified nanoparticles on the elongations at break of the nanocomposite membranes were different. The decrease in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness were widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inorganic reinforcement [37–39]. Moreover, the ionic linkages in nanocomposite membranes prepared from modi-fied nanoparticles are higher than hydrogen bonding in PPBI/SiO2and PPBI/TiO2.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The brittleness of PPBI/TiO2 based nanocomposite membranes is higher than PPBI/SiO2 ones. The brittleness of membranes pre-pared from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI are less than PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV membranes which are perhaps due to more com-patibility of PVI grafted chains onto the nanoparticles surface with PPBI backbone.', 'Comparing the brittleness of the nanocomposite membranes of the PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/SiO2-PVI with PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, respectively indicates that the brittleness of the membranes prepared with modified SiO2 nanoparticles is less than the modified TiO2 ones.', '3.6. Morphological analysis', 'The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photographs of the PPBI/TiO2-PSV nanocomposite membranes surface with various amounts of TiO2-PSV are shown in Fig. 15.', 'A relatively flat surface is observed for thin membranes of pure PPBI (Fig. 15(a)). Fig. 15(b–d) display surface morphological properties of nanocomposite membranes having 5, 10 and 15% of TiO2-PSV, respectively.', 'As seen in Fig. 15, TiO2-PSV nanoparticles are dispersed homo-geneously in PPBI matrixes and are increased with increasing of the percentage of TiO2-PSV nanoparticles. Also the major amounts of nanoparticles size are in the range of nanoscale and the bigger parti-cles as evidence for the formation of aggregations are not observed. The size of the TiO2-PSV particles are about 25–40 nm and the size of particles on the surface of the nanocomposite are determined to be 30–60 nm.', 'Fig. 16(a) shows the SEM micrographs of the modified SiO2nanoparticles. If the interactions between silica nanoparticles are stronger than that of between PPBI molecules and silica nanoparticles, the silica nanoparticles are agglomerated together to form silica domains in micrometer sizes. The compatibility between PPBI and unmodified nanoparticles and the homogene-ity of the PPBI/SiO2 or PPBI/TiO2 membranes are somewhat poor [32].', 'However, the dispersion homogeneity of silica nanoparticles in PPBI membranes could be significantly improved with using surface modified nanoparticles as the additives. As shown in Fig. 16(b), the dispersion homogeneity of modified nanoparticles is observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2 nanocomposite membrane, which demonstrates high compatibility between PPBI polymer and PSV-SiO2 nanoparticles and the high dispersion abil-ity of PSV-SiO2 in PPBI matrix. Particle agglomeration is still not observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2-10%. The ionic linkages between PPBI and modified nanoparticles are contributed to their higher compatibility [32]. However, in nanocompos-ite membranes prepared from un-modified SiO2 nanoparticles, thedispersionofthenanoparticlesinpolymermatrixis not homogenous and probably aggregation has been formed (Fig. 16(c)).', '@', '@', '4. Conclusion', 'The nanocomposite PPBI-based membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified and un-modified TiO2 and SiO2nanoparticles. The thermal stability of the prepared nanocompos- ite membranes was similar to PPBI membrane. The water uptake of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from TiO2/PSV and SiO2/PSV nanoparticles were higher than other nanocomposite membranes. The acid doping level and proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes in dry conditions obtained from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI nanoparticles were the highest in comparison to PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV. Formation of nanocomposites with modified and un-modified nanoparticles resulted the increas-ing of tensile strengths. The decreasing in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness was widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inor-ganic reinforcement. The high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicated that this membrane could be utilized as a proton exchange membrane for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. M.-G.
