R.  China  2 Faculty of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130023, P. R.  China', '(Received: 21 May, 2007; published: 10 September, 2007)', 'Abstract: We reported a chemical approach for the in-situ preparation of  conducting polyaniline (PANI)/Fe2O3 composite dispersions using dodecylbenzene  sulfonic (DBSA) acid both as dopant and surfactant. The PANI/Fe2O3 composite  dispersions were characterized by X-ray diffraction, UV-vis and FT-IR spectra and  conductivity measurement. The dispersions showed good stability and existed  without precipitate for at least half a year. The gas-sensing behavior of the  composite film to 100 ppm of NH3 was studied through monitoring the change of  the resistance.', 'Keywords: PANI/Fe2O3 composite, dispersions, dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid', 'Introduction', 'Recently, polymeric composites containing metal oxides have attracted a great deal  of attention from researchers because they frequently exhibit unexpected hybrid  properties synergistically derived from both components [1-4]. Meanwhile, they  exhibit interesting properties with many applications such as quantum electronic  devices, gas sensors, capacitors, conducting paints and rechargeable batteries [5-8].  Composites of polyaniline (PANI) have been widely studied in view of their unique  electrical, dielectrical, optical and optoelectrical properties in addition to their easy  preparation and excellent environmental stability [9-12]. However, the poor solubility  limits their application as conducting materials. To overcome this obstacle,  functionalized protonic acids such as dedecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) or  camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) have been used to dope PANI and the obtained  conducting products were soluble in many kinds of solvents [13-14].', 'On the other hand, composite of PANI and iron oxides (Fe2O3 or Fe3O4) has been  extensively investigated because of their unique magnetic properties and application  prospects in technology [15-24]. But most of the composites were in powder state;  therefore, the processes to prepare film for application in devices are complicated. In  our experiment, we prepare the conducting PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions in  aqueous solution by one step, and the so-obtained PANI/Fe2O3 composite  dispersions can be directly used to prepare conducting films and hence make  different devices.', 'In our former work, we have investigated the formation of the PANI dispersions under  different preparation conductions by changing the concentration of surfactant, aniline,  acid and the ratio of aniline to ammonium persulphate (APS) [25]. In this study, we chose the optimum conditions considering the above factors to prepare the  PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions by in-situ polymerization using DBSA both as  dopant and surfactant. The dispersions of PANI/Fe2O3 composite could exist without  any precipitate for at least half a year. In addition, it can be diluted by distilled water  for many times without generation of precipitate, indicating their high stability or  nearly solution characteristic. The structure and conductivity of the composite was  studied by X-ray, UV-vis and FT-IR spectra, and four-probe technology. The gas-sensing behavior of the film prepared by directly spinning the dispersions on silicon  chip was studied.', 'Results and discussion', 'Formation', 'As for the formation of the dispersions, we assumed that the Fe2O3 particles were  dispersed in water aqueous solution and it would act as ‘seed’ to induce the  polymerization of aniline. In our experiment, the Fe2O3 particles were homogeneously  dispersed in the reaction system because DBSA with hydrophilic group acted as  surfactant. Then the aniline monomer contacted with Fe2O3 nearly at the same time,  which could accelerate the induction time of polymerization [26]. This effect could be  observed by monitoring the change of the solution temperature as shown in Fig. 1.  From Fig. 1, we can see that the time for the seed polymerization to start was about  300 s (Fig. 1b) while without Fe2O3 particles was about 3300 s along (Fig. 1a).', '@', '@', 'XRD pattern', 'The XRD pattern of PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions is shown in Fig. 2. In the  pattern, the 2θ at 35.6, 43.4, 53.6, 57.3, and 62.8 o are contributed to γ-Fe2O3, and  33.08, 40.78 and 49.42 o are related to α-Fe2O3. The broad peaks at about 19.9 and  24.1 o are characteristic peaks of PANI [27]. These results indicate that the PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions contain two different phases of the Fe2O3  particles, and the PANI is amorphous in the composite.', '@', '@', 'UV-vis spectra', '@', '@', 'The UV-vis absorption spectra of PANI and the PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions  are shown in Fig. 3. A typical absorption spectrum of PANI dispersions has three distinct absorption peaks at 351, 436, and 757 nm, respectively (Fig. 3a). The peak  at 351 nm arises from π-π* electron transition within benzenoid segments, the peak  at 436 nm is due to the polaron state and the wide peak at 757 nm is related to the  doping level [28]. Compared to the PANI dispersions, the absorption peak of  PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions show little difference, for example, the peak at  757 nm shifts to 746 nm (Fig. 3b). The shift may be originated from the decreasing  doping level by the addition of Fe2O3.', 'FT-IR spectra', 'The FT-IR spectra of PANI and PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions are shown in Fig.  4. From Fig. 4a, we can find the characteristic peaks of PANI: the peak at 684 cm-1 is  usually assigned to the C-H out of plane bending in 1, 2 ring in intrinsic PANI; the  peak at 1083 cm-1 stands for the C-H aromatic in-plane bending on 1, 4 ring; the  peak at 1183 cm-1 may be assigned to the carbon skeleton, and the peak of 1311 cm-1 is contributed to C-N stretching mode. The strong peak at 1459 cm-1 is related to  C=C stretching mode of the benzenoid ring and a weak peak of quionoid ring at 1548  cm-1 means the high doping degree of the PANI [29]. And from Fig. 4b, we can see  that when the Fe2O3 particles present in the dispersion, the intensity of the peak at  1459 cm-1 is decreased and shift to 1461 cm-1, which represents the decrease of  doping degree of the PANI. There may be some interaction between the lone pair  electrons of N atom in PANI chains with 3d orbit of Fe atom, which could reduce the  energy level interval of aromatic nucleus. This also caused the UV-vis absorption  band of composite dispersions to have a red shift [30].', '@', '@', 'Conductivity', 'Table 1 shows the conductivity values measured by using four-probe technology at  25 0C. Compared to pure PANI, the conductivity of PANI/Fe2O3 composite with Fe2O3  content of 0.05 g increases from 0.98 to 1.07μS/cm. This may be attributed to the  doping effect associated with Fe2O3 particles that are believed to help induce the  formation of a more efficient network for change transport, thus enhancing the conductivity of the composite [31]. However, with increasing the content of Fe2O3, the  relative contents of the conducting polymer are decreased, resulting in the decrease  of the corresponding conductivity. The decrease may be attributed to two factors: (a)  the insulating behavior of the Fe2O3 particles in the core of the composites; (b) a  decrease of doping degree as the UV-vis and FT-IR spectra show [32].', '@', '@', 'Gas-sensing behavior', 'The gas-sensing behavior of PANI/Fe2O3 composite film to 100 ppm of NH3 is shown  in Fig. 5. The y-axis is the normalized resistance (R- R0/R0), where R0 is the initial  resistance of the composite film before exposure to NH3 at t = 0 and R is the time  dependent resistance of the film exposed to the test gas.', '@', '@', 'From Fig. 5 we could see that the composite film has a significant sensitivity to NH3.  The response time of the composite film is 40 s. It can be applied to the detection of  ammonia, and the further study of the sensitivity to NH3 and other gases is under  way.', 'Stability', 'The stability of the dispersions with different content of Fe2O3 particles was studied.  When the content of Fe2O3 particles in the dispersions was lower than 0.05 g, the  dispersions show good stability and existed without precipitate at least half a year.  However, when the content was beyond 0.05 g, there were some precipitates on the  bottom of the dispersion and the quantity of the precipitates increased with the  content of Fe2O3.', 'Conclusions', 'PANI/Fe2O3 dispersions were prepared using DBSA both as dopant and surfactant.  The XRD, UV-vis and FT-IR characterization indicated that there is some interaction  between the PANI and Fe2O3. The conductivity of the dispersions increased when a  little of Fe2O3 particles were added and decreased in line when a great quantity of  Fe2O3 were added. The dispersions showed good stability and existed without  precipitate for at least half a year. A film were prepared by directly spinning the  PANI/Fe2O3 dispersions on a chip of silicon to study the gas-sensing of100ppm NH3;  the response time is only 40 s and further study of the sensitivity to the NH3 is under  way.', 'Experimental', 'Materials', 'Aniline was freshly distilled under reduced pressure and other chemicals were used  as received without further purification. Fe2O3 particles were synthesized by  coprecipitation.', 'Preparation of PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersion', 'PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions were prepared using an in-situ polymerization  method. A typical experiment was done as follows: 0.465 g of aniline was dispersed  into 100 ml of DBSA aqueous solution (0.2 M) under stirring, after which 0.1 g of  Fe2O3 was added into the above solution under ultrasonic. APS in powder state was  then added into the mixture solution. The dispersions of PANI/Fe2O3 composite were  obtained after stirring for 1 h. The PANI dispersions were prepared by the same  approach in absence of Fe2O3. Acetone damaging dispersions were centrifuged and  washed with distilled water, ethanol and acetone three times, respectively. The  resulting powder were dried under reduced pressure at room temperature and then  used for XRD and conductivity measurements.', 'Characterization', 'The composite dispersions was spun onto a chip of silicon and dried under 60 oC in  order to remove the solvent and form a film for the UV-vis and FT-IR spectra  measurement and study NH3 gas-sensing behavior. UV-vis and FT-IR spectra were  recorded on a UV 3100 spectrometer and on FT-IR-8400s (Shimadzu) spectrometer,  respectively. The conductivity measurements were made by the conventional four-probe (SDY-5) method on pressed pellets of the composite powders prepared at  ambient temperature (25 oC). The gas-sensing behavior, which could be reflected by  the resistance change of the resulting PANI/Fe2O3 composite film upon exposure to  100 ppm of NH3, was monitored with a digital multimeter (DT9205).']

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25�C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 �C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 �10�4 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 �0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 �C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 �C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by significant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of �4 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers.', '�2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through proton exchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Nafion�as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18].', 'Transport properties and nanostructure of sulfonated polyimide (SPI) membranes have been studied using pulsed field gradient NMR and NMR quadrupolar relaxation rates determinations [19,20], and small angle scattering methods (SAXS and SANS), respectively [21,22].', 'The microstructure of sulfonated polyetherether ketone (sPEEK) has been investigated by SAXS [12]. We recently reported a class of ionomers based on aromatic hydrocarbon copolymers with high proton conductivity and excellent thermal mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states [22e29]. Sulfonated poly-arylenethioethersulfone(SPTES)copolymershavefollowing chemical structures (Fig. 1).', 'SPTES copolymers including SPTES-50, SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80, have equivalent weight (EW) and IEC (mequiv./g) values of 610, 515, 459, 417, and 1.64, 1.94, 2.18, and 2.4, respectively [22]. They exhibited proton conductivity of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm respectively, at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity [22]. Their excellent proton conductivity at high temperatures combined with their high glass transition temperature (w200 �C) and mechanical stability (both in the dry and hydrated states) make them excellent potentials as high temperature PEM materials for fuel cells. SPTES-50 copolymer membrane has successfully been fabricated to membrane electrode assemblies and exhibited polarization curves and durability up to 400 h [29]. Their successful operations at 90e100 �C were limited by boiling point of water (100 �C at 1 atm). Replacing water molecules with heterocycles such as imidazolium where the charge carrier has a very low vapor pressure can result in proton conductivity at higher temperatures. Despite excellent electrochemical properties, excessive water uptake of SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes provide difficulties to be made as membrane electrode assembly [22,27] The proton transport and performance of SPTES copolymers highly depend on the presence of water molecules. In addition to the number of sulfonic groups, their acidity (pKa) ability to dissociate water molecules to proton, water activity coefficient, and number of water molecules associated with each sulfonic group, the supermolecular structure of the hydro-phobic and hydrophilic phases is also defined by polymer chain characteristics such as chain persistent length, and presence of sulfonic group on the backbone or in the side chains. We reported the presence of ionic nanodomains containing water molecules in the SPTES-70 using in-situ x-ray scattering [27]. The morphology and the nanostructure of SPTES-50 were approximated by corre-lated polydisperse spherical aggregates and a larger scale water domain network and were quantified by modeling of the SANS spectra with polydisperse hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [29]. This study reports the nanostructure and morphology of sulfonated polyarylenethioethersulfone (SPTES) copolymer membranes which is directly related to the proton transport through the membrane in terms of their degree of sulfonation and temperature dependency.', '2. Materials and methods', '2.1. Materials', 'Visually observed defect free films of SPTES copolymers were prepared by dissolving the purified copolymer in dimethyl acet-amide (DMAc, Sigma Aldrich) (5e10 wt%) filtering, placing in a flat dish in a vacuum oven with a gradual temperature rise to 100 �C for 24 h and 120 �C for 2 h. The resulting uniform flat films were immersed for 2 h in deionized water and dried under vacuum (24 h, 80 �C) after they were acidified in sulfuric acid (4 M, 24 h) to ensure complete conversion of sulfonic groups to their protonated forms.', '2.2. Characterization', 'SANS experiments were performed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Neutron Center for Research using 30 m NG-7 SANS instrument with a neutron wavelength, l, of 6 Å (Dl/l ¼ 10%) and three sample-to-detector distance of 1.5 m, 10 m (l ¼ 6 Å), and 15 m (l ¼ 8 Å), 0.001 < q < 0.3168 Å�1 at 25, and 55 �C (accuracy of 0.5 �C). Hydrated membranes were placed in demountable 1 mm thick titanium liquid cells filled with D2O after equilibrium in D2O (24 h). Scattered intensities were reduced, corrected for the transmission and background and placed on absolute scale. Then, circularly averaged to produce absolute scale scattering intensity, I(q), as a function of the wave vector, q, where q ¼ (4p/l)sin(q/2) and q is the scattering angle. Calculations were performed using Igor Pro�software [30,31]. USANS experiments covered a q-range of 0.00005 < q (Å�1) < 0.01, corresponding to a real-space length scale of 0.1 microne10 micron.', '3. Results and discussions', '3.1. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 25 �C', 'SPTES copolymers have high proton conductivity at high relative humidities and elevated temperatures; e.g. 65 �C and 85% RH of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers, respectively [27]. The degree of sulfonation increases for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6%, respectively. SPTES-50 copolymer has the lowest the degree of sulfonation and SPTES-80 copolymer has the highest degree of sulfonation in this class of copolymers [22,27]. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers at 25 �C show a scattering behavior of a two phase structure (Fig. 2a). The contribution of sulfonic groups to the scattering is considered to be negligible due to their small volume compared to the polymer and the water phase volume. It was visually observed that membranes do not dissociate when fully hydrated in the examined temperature. It was also determined by weight measurement that the membranes maintain the weight after deswelling. Therefore, the hydrophobic polymeric structure is the supporting network even at high water content and increased temperatures. Fig. 2a presents enhanced scattering intensity data (vertically shifted) for the hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copol-ymer membranes in the order of 20X, 1000X, and 2 �105X for the clarity of data presentation. The absolute scale scattering intensities in the medium q range of 0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1 are almost in the same intensity range for all SPTES copolymers. The high q scattering spectra for all copolymers exhibit a feature which is attributed to the presence of ionic domains containing water molecules. According to the scattering results, the morphology of all hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C can be approximated as correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates with liquid-like ordering (P.Y. ordering) and a power law decay [29]. The scattering data for the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C were compared and quantified using polydisperse (Schulz polydispersity) hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [32e34] and a low q power law decay [29]. The modeling of the SPETS 50 nanostructure and its properties have been reported elsewhere but presented here for clarity and completeness of the SPTES series analysis [29]. Fig. 2b shows the experimental scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 25 �C compared with the theoretical calculations of the model (solid line). The results of the comparison of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes scattering data with the model are summarized in Table 1. According to this modeling the domain radius increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 13.45,14.9,15.4, and 16.9 Å for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes. The hard sphere packing density increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 19.8%, 23%, 25%, 29% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. This could indicate that ionic domains are capable of holding more water molecules with the presence of more sulfonic groups on the polymer backbone (increasing the degree of sulfonation). The high-q scattering spectra exhibits onset of a peak formation when the degree of sulfonation was increased to 71.6% for SPTES-80 copolymer. Pres-ence of scattering maxima can be due to the scattering from an ordered structure (periodicity) or the oscillations resulted from the structural factor effects or the excluded volume effect arising from short range liquid-like ordering. The onset of peak formation is attributed to the excluded volume effects related to the liquid-like ordering [33e35]. The low-q power law decay of nearly �3 was observed for all SPTES copolymers in the range of 1 �10�4 < q (1/ Å) < 3 �10�3. The power law decay of �3 is attributed to the presence of interacting three-dimensional fractal morphology. In addition, a Guinier plateau [35] was present for the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer at the very low q (q (1/Å) < 9 �10�5). This is in addition to the nearly identical scattering intensity in the inter-mediate q-range (0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1). It can be concluded that the change in the degree of sulfonation had little or no effect on the intermediate and low angle scattering wave vector. The low-q power law decay was nearly �3 �0.1 for all SPTES copolymers. The presence of sharp interface between hydrophobic and hydro-philic domains was deduced from the power law decay of �4 at large angle wave vectors for all hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes. All scattering data presented in Fig. 2a shows a power slope of �3.85 to �4.15 which is approximated as w �4. The presence of Porod behavior (decay of �4) has been attributed to the two immiscible phase with a sharp boundary [35e37]. This shows that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are separated with a distinct interface containing sulfonic groups.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Presence of a plateau in the scattering spectra is characteristics of isolated scatterers [35]. The radius of gyration (Rg) of the isolated scatterers can be approximated by IðqÞ ¼ I0expðð�q2R2gÞ=3Þ, where I0 is the extrapolated zero scattering intensity (Guinier approxi-mation) [35]. Presence of the Guinier plateau in the q range of 4.3 �10�5 < q (1/Å) < 8.2 �10�5 for SPTES-80 copolymer suggests segregation of the isolated large scale hydrophilic water pockets when the degree of sulfonation increased to 71.6%. Radius of gyration of the isolated larger scale water pockets in fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was 1.3 �0.18 micron which was calculated from this approximation (Fig. 2c).', '@', '@', '3.2. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 55 �C', 'Based on the physical observations, water saturated membranes at 55 �C were swollen films without visual dissociation. Fig. 3 exhibits the scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. The inter-mediate scattering intensity decreased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes start to form scattering maxima at high q range when the degree of sulfonation increased. This indicated the increase in the excluded volume due to the increase in the volume of the scatterers at higher degree of sulfonation and increased temperature (55 �C). The presence of scattering maxima is more significant for SPTES-70 copolymer and SPTES-80 copolymer with 63.3 and 71.6% degree of sulfonation. The large angle scattering feature shows scattering maxima at qmax of 0.103 and 0.1108 1/Å for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers which correspond to spatial characteristics lengths (l ¼ 2p/qmax) of 60.97 and 56.7 Å due to concentration fluctuations of hydrated domains (hard spheres). The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes changed significantlywith increasing degree of sulfonation. This indicates a substantial change in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology with increasing degree of sulfonation at 55 �C which is more pronounced for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers (degree of sulfonation 63.3 and 71.6%, respectively). Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are segregated distinctly by the sulfonic groups at the interface which is repre-sented by the Porod behavior, asymptotic behavior of w �4 for all SPTES copolymers [35e37]. The morphology of these membranes is complex and controlled by interfacial phenomena. The number of sulfonic groups per repeat unit volume and their acidity com-plemented with the chain persistent length and chain mobility are governing factors in the formed morphology. This study approxi-mates the morphology of the fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55 �C are approximated as spherical nanodomains containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering similar to their morphology at 25 �C. It is also proposed that this morphology changedtofractalmorphologywithincreasing temperature (increasing the intermediate scattering decay). The domain radius and the sphere packing density were increased from 26.4 Å and 28% for SPTES-50 copolymer to 32 Å and 33% for SPTES-60copolymerwhiletheintermediatescatteringintensity decreased. The domain radius and packing density of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane increased from 13.45 Å and 19.8% to 26.4 Å and 28% when the temperature increased from 25 �C to 55 �C with this approximation. The same increasing trend of 14.9 Åe32 Å for the average domain radius and 23%e33% of the sphere packing density was observed. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane compared to the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane is attributed to the disruption of the large scale morphology. The low q power law decay of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane was close to the decay of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane.', 'The increase in the degree of sulfonation of SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymers from 54.9, to 63.3 and 71.6% resulted in a shift in the position of the high q scattering maxima of the hydrated membranes toward the large angle scattering regime. This peak formation is more prominent for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copoly-mers with higher sulfonation degree. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering intensity in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers is attributed to the loss of the large scale water network, intermediate fractal morphology within the polymer and onset of a morphology change to a two large scale phase morphology. The closed domain morphology of polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with fractal network were present for fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55�C (Figs. 3 and 4a). However, substantialchangesinthemorphologyoffullyhydrated membranes occurred when the degree of sulfonation is increased to 63.3 and 71.6% for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers at higher temperature of 55 �C. Combination of high temperature, high density of sulfonic groups, and significant amount of water mole-cules within the polymer backbone could have resulted in the coalescence of the small spherical ionic domains and fractal water network into a larger scale bicontinuous network of intermeshed hydrophobic and hydrophilic morphology for fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane at 55 �C. The bicontinuous model origi-nally proposed for micro-emulsion of two immiscible phases of water and oil with comparable amount based on Landau theory [38,39]. This model describes two irregular shapes with distinct boundary and has been used for intermesh of hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure when the particle shape is not well-defined [40,41]. This model proposes I(q) ¼ (a2þc1q þ c2q2)�1 for a2 > 0, c1 < 0, and c2 > 0, a single broad scattering maxima, and power law decay of �4 at large scattering angles. Two characteristics lengths of d and x are deduced from this analysis having a2, c1, and c2[39,40], d is the domain periodicity or interdomain distance and x is the correlation length which has been attributed to the dispersion of d. According to this theory, c1 is negative due to the surfactant. The absolute values of c1 and the ratio of x/d should increase with increasing surfactant. The specific internal surface area can be derived from the ratio of S/V ¼ 44(1�4)/x [38,39].', 'The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane has a low-q upturn, a lower intermediate scattering intensity compared to the hydrated SPTES-60 and SPTES-50 copolymers, and a large angle maxima followed by a power law decay of �4. This indicates the onset of the coalescence of the ionic aggregates, disruption of the fractal water network, and the formation of the two irregular large scale bicontinuous phase morphology. The high q range (q > 0.037 1/Å) of the scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 55 �C was compared with the T.S. bicontinuous model (Fig. 4b). This simulation resulted in a periodicity, d, of 59.9 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima position, 60.97 Å. According to this simulation, the correlation length (x) is 31.14 Å. The medium-q range scattering still exhibits the larger scale morphology which is not completely converted to the bi-continuous phase morphology. However, they are partially collapsed characterized by a lower scattering intensity in the intermediate q range. The high q maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 is approximated as bicontinuous morphology. The low and medium q (q < 0.037 1/Å) scattering spectra of the SPTES 70 is due to the presence of fractal network of waters which have not coalesce yet.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The scattering spectra of the SPTES-80 copolymer are consistent with a bicontinuous two phase structure of irregular shapes with sulfonic groups as interfacial ionic region. The scattering experi-mental data of the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was compared with this model (q > 0.015 1/Å), (Fig. 4c and Table 2). The periodicity of the water domains (or hydrophobic domains), d, predicted by this model is w54 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima (qmax), 56.7 Å. This value is the distance between water domains. The correlation length (x) obtained from this model is 37.86 Å which is a measure of dispersion.', 'The distance between the water phases, periodicity, was decreased from 59.9 Å to 54 Å with increasing degree of sulfona-tion. The correlation length, x, was increased from 31.14 Å to 37.86 Å when the degree of sulfonation increased. Increasing the interfacial area results in an increase in the x/d ratio. The presence of the upturn in the low range of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 at 55 �C (Fig. 4b and c) is attributed to the fractal morphology of the large scale features.', '3.3. Discussions', 'Scattering data of series of SPTES membranes were obtained in the full hydration state with increasing the sulfonation degree in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. Complete study was performed to provide understanding membranes morphology with increasing the temperature of the hydrated membranes from 25 �C to 55 �C. Proposed model assumes spherical nanodomains containing water molecules forming from clustering of the sulfonation groups. This assumption was performed based on previously reported study which showed spherical nanodomains in the dry SPTES 50 membrane under HR-TEM [29]. The scattering spectra of the membranes with high degree of sulfonation (SPTES 70, and 80) changed significantly when the temperature increased to 55 �C. The morphology is approximated as bi-continuous system where the hydrocarbon is the main support network containing water. This model has been recently proposed by Wnek et al. [40], Gebel [8], and Kreuer [12], Wnek also provided visualization of the hydro-phobic cluster using SYBYL version 6.7 (Tripos) and HINT (Hydro-pathicINTeractions)computationalmodelingsoftware[40]. Despite the support of the transport studies of this model [42], there is no direct visualization method for this proposed approxi-mation. The T. S. model is also supported by high proton conduc-tivity of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 membranes at 55 �C where a larger number of hydronium ions in a larger domain can facilitate proton transport. A summary of the structural evolution of the SPTES membranes as a function of temperature and degree of sulfonation is illustrated in Table 3. This study attempted to study a full range of SPTES membrane nanostructure for the first time and provide an understanding of large membrane water uptakes, and their morphology and their relation with high conductivity of the membranes using both liquid like ordering of polydisperse nano-spheres and bi-continuous T.S. model approximation.', '@', '@', 'Table 3 Summary of membrane structural changes (SPTES 50, 60, 70, and 80 at 25 �C, and SPTES 50 and 60 at 55 �C) as a function of degree of sulfonation and temperature by polydisperse hard sphere model with liquid-like ordering ordering). T.S. bi-continuous model was approximated for higher sulfonation degree copolymers, SPTES 70 and 80, at 55 �C.', '@', '4. Conclusions', 'A series of SPTES copolymers with high proton conductivity of 100e215 mS/cm at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity as potential fuel cells membranes were studied. SANS studies of fully hydrated membranes showed that the nanostructure of the fully hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C in agreement with ionic aggregates containing water molecules with a large scale morphology network of water pockets morphology. This model predicted that the increase in the degree of sulfonation resulted in an increase in the radius of ionic domains and an increase in the volume packing density of water in the aggregates. It was assumed that the same morphology of polydisperse correlated spherical ionic domains were present in the SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymers when the temperature increased to 55 �C. Increase in the degree of sulfonation for fully hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer at 55 �C led to a substantial reorganization of the membrane morphology which was described by a bi-continuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic network.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to thank the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Nano-structured andBiological Materials Branch forfunding this research.
