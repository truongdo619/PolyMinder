Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25\ue000C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 \ue000C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 \ue00110\ue0024 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 \ue0030.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 \ue000C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 \ue000C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of \ue0024 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 \ue000C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by signi\ue000cant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of \ue0024 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers.', '\ue0002011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through proton exchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Na\ue000on\ue001as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18].', 'Transport properties and nanostructure of sulfonated polyimide (SPI) membranes have been studied using pulsed \ue000eld gradient NMR and NMR quadrupolar relaxation rates determinations [19,20], and small angle scattering methods (SAXS and SANS), respectively [21,22].']

Weidentify that this limitation arises from EA-GLE’s feature prediction constraints. In thispaper, we introduce EAGLE-3, which aban-dons feature prediction in favor of direct tokenprediction and replaces reliance on top-layerfeatures with multi-layer feature fusion via atechnique named training-time test. These im-provements significantly enhance performanceand enable the draft model to fully benefitfrom scaling up training data.Our experi-ments include both chat models and reason-ing models, evaluated on five tasks. The re-sults show that EAGLE-3 achieves a speedupratio up to 6.5x, with about 1.4x improve-ment over EAGLE-2. The code is availableat https://github.com/SafeAILab/EAGLE.', '1Introduction', 'Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are being applied to more domains, with their improved capa-bilities driven by scaling model parameters—some LLMs now exceed hundreds of billions of param-eters. In autoregressive generation, each token requires accessing all model parameters, making LLM inference slow and costly.', 'Recently, test-time scaling up has gained sig-nificant attention. Models like ChatGPT o1 and DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025) engage in delib-erate reasoning before responding, pushing the boundaries of LLM capabilities at the cost of longer inference time. However, these models often re-quire lengthy reasoning processes, making them extremely costly, while the increased response time severely impacts user satisfaction. These reasoning models significantly increase the proportion of in-ference costs in the overall LLM pipeline, driving researchers to explore cheaper and faster inference optimization methods.', '@', '@', 'Speculative sampling methods can reduce LLM latency by partially parallelizing the generation pro-cess. These methods rapidly generate draft tokens and then verify them in parallel. This allows multi-ple tokens to be produced in a single forward pass, significantly reducing inference latency. In vanilla speculative sampling, the draft model is a separate, smaller LLM, typically a lower-parameter version from the same series as the target model. This draft model operates independently of the target model. Unlike the vanilla speculative sampling, EAGLE (Li et al., 2024c) reuses the top-layer fea-tures of the target model (the features before the LM head). It trains the draft model to autoregres-sively predict the next feature and then uses the target model’s LM head to obtain the draft token. By leveraging the rich information from the target model, EAGLE achieves significantly better accel-eration compared to vanilla speculative sampling. Subsequent methods such as HASS (Zhang et al., 2024) and Falcon (Gao et al., 2024) also adopt the approach of predicting the next feature using the current feature sequence.', '@', '@', 'Recent LLMs have increasingly relied on larger training datasets to achieve better performance. For example, LLaMA series models with sizes of 7B (8B) have used 1T, 2T, and 15T tokens of training data for LLaMA 1 (Touvron et al., 2023a), LLaMA 2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), and LLaMA 3 (Dubey et al., 2024), respectively, resulting in significant improvements across various metrics while keeping the model architecture and inference cost largely unchanged. Similarly, we aim to improve the ac-ceptance rate and acceleration ratio of EAGLE by increasing its training data. Unfortunately, we ob-serve that the gains from additional training data for EAGLE are limited. We analyze the reasons behind this phenomenon. As shown in the upper part of Figure 3, EAGLE performs autoregressive prediction at the feature level, predicting the next feature and then feeding the feature into the LM head of the target model to obtain the token dis-tribution. EAGLE’s loss function consists of two components: the feature prediction loss lfea and the token prediction loss ltoken. Thanks to the feature prediction loss, the draft model trained only at Step 1 can adapt to Step 2 and acquire multi-step predic-tion capabilities. However, with token prediction as the ultimate goal, feature prediction can be seen as an additional constraint, which limits the expres-siveness of the draft model and makes it difficult to benefit from increased data. After removing the feature constraint and expanding the training data (the middle part of Figure 3), as shown in Figure 4, the acceptance rate 0-α of the first draft token improves significantly. However, the output of the draft model in Step 1, denoted as ˆat+1, is far away from the ground-truth ft+1, causing the the input sequence f1, f2, · · · , ft, ˆat+1 in Step 2 to deviate significantly from the training distribution, result-ing in a very low acceptance rate 1-α for the second draft token, as shown in Figure 4. We can address this issue by incorporating Step 1 into the train-ing process (the bottom of Figure 3). Using this method, the benefits of increasing training data be-come more pronounced. We name this technique as training-time test.', 'EAGLE and speculative sampling methods such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2024) reuse the top-layer fea-tures of the target model, specifically the features immediately before the LM head. For an LM head with a full-rank weight matrix, the top-layer fea-tures corresponding to the logits of the next token are unique, ensuring that the information contained in these features aligns directly with the logits of the next token. However, predicting the next-next token based solely on top-layer features—which are inherently limited to the next token—poses a significant challenge. Fortunately, the training-time test technique described above enables the use of features from intermediate layers instead of relying solely on the top layer, as the feature prediction loss lfea has been removed during training.', 'To summarize, this paper introduces EAGLE-3, an enhanced version of EAGLE that achieves a significant speedup. EAGLE-3 is parallelized and fully compatible with the drafting tree tech-nique from EAGLE-2 (Li et al., 2024b). Our key contributions include:', '@', '@', '@', '@', '• A novel training-time test architecture forthe draft model: We remove the feature pre-diction constraint and directly predict tokens while simulating multi-step generation during training. This direct token prediction provides complete flexibility in the draft model’s input. Instead of reusing only the top-layer features, we integrate and leverage low-, mid-, and high-level features from the target model, capturing rich semantic information from different lay-ers.', '• Discovery of a scaling law for inference ac-celeration in large language models: With the new architecture, we observe that increas-ing the amount of training data for the draft model leads to a proportional increase in the speedup ratio of EAGLE-3. This scaling be-havior was not observed in the original EA-GLE architecture, as shown in Figure 1', '• Improved inference acceleration: EAGLE-3, trained with approximately 8x more data than EAGLE, achieves a 1.4x latency speedup over EAGLE-2 at batch size 1. For large-batch inference, EAGLE-3 also surpasses the imple-mentation of vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023) in throughput, even at batch sizes up to 56. We expect larger data size would lead to further improved speedup ratio.', '2Preliminaries', '2.1Speculative Sampling', 'Speculative sampling (Leviathan et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2024c,b) is a lossless LLM acceleration technique that alternates between draft-ing and verification, where drafting is performed at low cost and verification is parallelized, corre-sponding to the generation of drafts and the veri-fication process, respectively. We use ti to denote the i-th token and Ta:b to represent the token se-quence ta, ta+1, · · · , tb. When T1:j is used as the prefix, the two stages of speculative sampling are as follows.', 'In the drafting stage, speculative sampling uti-lizes a draft model (a smaller version from the same series as the target model) to autoregressively gen-erate k tokens to form the draft. ˆTj+1:j+k, while also recording the probability ˆp for each token.', 'In the verification stage, speculative sampling invokes the target model to evaluate the draftˆTj+1:j+k and records its probability p. Specula-tive sampling then determines the acceptance of draft tokens sequentially, from front to back. For token ˆtj+i, the probability of acceptance is given by min(1, pj+i(ˆtj+i)/ˆpj+i(ˆtj+i)). If the token is accepted, the process moves to the next token. Oth-erwise, a token is sampled from the distribution norm(max(0, pj+i −ˆpj+i)) to replace ˆtj+i, and the remaining tokens in the draft are discarded. Ap-pendix A.1 of (Leviathan et al., 2023) proves that speculative sampling is consistent with the distri-bution of vanilla autoregressive decoding.', '2.2EAGLE and EAGLE-2', 'The draft model with limited capacity struggles to precisely approximate the large-scale target model. EAGLE leverages the top-layer features of the tar-get model as additional information and performs autoregression at the feature level, simplifying the drafting process. EAGLE performs autoregression at the feature level and then uses the LM head of the target model to obtain the draft token. Due to the sampling results at the token layer being hidden, feature-level autoregression introduces un-certainty. EAGLE addresses this issue by feeding the token sequence from the previous time step, i.e., the sampling results, into the draft model. Unlike the chain-like drafts of Vanilla speculative sam-pling, EAGLE generates multiple draft tokens at the same position, resulting in a tree-like draft. In the verification stage, EAGLE uses tree attention to parallelize the verification of the draft tree. Interest-ingly, EAGLE inspired the multi-token prediction technique used in the pre-training of DeepSeek-v3 (Liu et al., 2024a), which in turn inspired new architectural designs in EAGLE-3.', 'EAGLE (Li et al., 2024c) and Medusa (Cai et al.,2024), among others, use tree-shaped drafts, where the structure of the draft tree is predefined, static, and context-independent. The difficulty of draft-ing is closely related to the context, and a static draft tree can lead to resource wastage. EAGLE-2 (Li et al., 2024b) approximates the acceptance rate using the confidence of the draft model and dy-namically generates the draft tree based on this, per-forming pruning of the draft tree at the end of the drafting stage. EAGLE-3 also adopts the context-aware dynamic draft tree proposed in EAGLE-2.', '3EAGLE-3', 'In this section, we provide a detailed description of the implementation of EAGLE-3.', '@', '@', '3.1Inference Pipeline', 'Consistent with other speculative sampling meth-ods, EAGLE-3 alternates between the drafting and verification stages. The difference between EAGLE-3 and EAGLE lies in the drafting stage, which we introduce with an example, as shown in Figure 5. Consider the prefix “How can”. Dur-ing the prefill phase or the previous verification stage, the target model performs a forward pass to generate the next token, “I”. We record the low, middle, and high-level feature sequences from the target model’s forward pass, denoted as l, m, and h, respectively. We concatenate the k-dimensional vectors l, m, and h to form a 3k-dimensional vector, then pass it through a fully connected (FC) layer to reduce it to k-dimensions, obtaining a feature g that integrates information from different layers. Here, k refers to the hidden size of the target model.', 'Our goal is to generate a draft token sequence with the prefix “How can I”. By inputting only ghow and gcan, the draft model cannot access the random sampling process. Therefore, similar to EAGLE (Li et al., 2024c), we introduce the embed-ding eI of the sampled token “I”. The concatenated vector is then passed through an FC layer to reduce its dimensionality to k, and subsequently inputted into a single layer decoder, producing the output a. Finally, we input aI into the LM head and sample to obtain the draft token “do”.', 'In Step 1, with the prefix “How can”, we reuse ghow and gcan from the target model. In Step 2, the prefix becomes “How can I”. Ideally, we would reuse ghow, gcan, and gI from the target model. How-ever, this is not possible because the token “I” has not yet been checked by the target model, and we cannot obtain gI. Instead, we use the output aI from the draft model in the previous step to replace gI, and concatenate aI with the embedding edo of the sampled result “do” as the input to the draft model in Step 1. In Step 3, we similarly cannot obtain gdo, so we use ado as a replacement, concatenating adowith eit as the input to the draft model. The same approach is followed for subsequent steps.', '3.2Draft Model Training', 'The input to the draft model in EAGLE is either, or at least approximately, the top-layer features f1, f2, · · · , ft of the target model. In contrast, the input to the draft model in EAGLE-3 may include the features g1, g2, · · · , gt from the target model, or it may include the output at+1, at+2 · · · , at+jfrom the draft model. Therefore, we need to train the draft model to adapt to different inputs. During training, we perform test steps, where we generate a and feed it back into the draft model for further training.', 'The core of the draft model in EAGLE-3 is a Transformer decoder layer. Aside from the self-attention operation, no other components interact with the context, so no further modifications are required during training or testing. The only com-ponent that requires slight modification is the self-attention, which we will describe in detail below.', 'Although the actual input consists of features, for clarity, we describe the process using tokens as input. As shown in Figure 6, the original train-ing data is a sequence of length 3, “How can I”, with a normal sequential dependency in the context. Therefore, the attention mask is a standard lower triangular matrix. The outputs at the three positions are “are”, “we”, and “do”, which have a tree-like contextual relationship with “how”, “can”, and “I”. As a result, when the input “are”, “we”, and “do” is fed into Step 2, the attention mask needs to be adjusted accordingly, as shown in the top-right cor-ner of Figure 6. All attention masks are diagonal, except when the original training data is used as the key. Using matrix multiplication in this case would result in significant computational waste, so we can use vector dot products to calculate the attention score only for the corresponding positions.', 'HASS (Zhang et al., 2024) and EAGLE-3 both make similar modifications to the attention mecha-nism to simulate the testing process during training, but this is not the main focus of EAGLE-3. The motivations, methods, and outcomes of the two ap-proaches are distinctly different. The motivation behind HASS is to mitigate the error accumula-tion caused by inaccurate feature predictions in EAGLE. HASS still performs feature prediction, includes a feature prediction loss lfea, and the in-put to the draft model must be the top-layer fea-tures. In contrast, the motivation behind EAGLE-3 is to remove unnecessary constraints to enhance the model’s expressive power. EAGLE-3 no longer requires the draft model’s output to fit the top-layer features of the target model, thus avoiding error accumulation. After removing feature prediction, the input to EAGLE-3 is completely free, and it is replaced by a fusion of features from different layers of semantic information. The removal of the feature prediction loss also enables us to discover a new scaling law for inference acceleration which was never found before. Figure 2 also shows the speedup of EAGLE-3 and HASS, with EAGLE-3 demonstrating significantly better performance.', '4Experiments', 'Models.

The frame-work used is also different from the other sections of this paper and from the typical settings in the speculative sampling domain, so comparisons with other experimental results are not meaningful.', '@', '@', '5Related Work', 'Many methods have been used to accelerate in-ference in LLMs, such as quantization (Hubara et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2021; Zadeh et al., 2020; Zafrir et al., 2019) and distilla-tion (Hinton et al., 2015). These methods generally have trade-offs, where there is a need to balance model performance with acceleration benefits.', 'Speculative sampling uses the target model for verification to ensure lossless acceleration. Early speculative decoding methods (Stern et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2021) accelerated generation in greedy settings, while Leviathan et al. (2023); Chen et al. (2023) introduced speculative sampling to extend the draft verification framework to non-greedy generation. Many subsequent works have improved upon speculative sampling.EAGLE (Li et al., 2024c), EAGLE-2 (Li et al., 2024b), Medusa (Cai et al., 2024), and Hydra (Ankner et al., 2024) reused the features of the target model. HASS (Zhang et al., 2024) simulates a multi-step draft process during training to mitigate the issues of training-inference inconsistency and error accu-mulation in EAGLE. GLIDE and CAPE (Du et al., 2024) reuse the target model’s KV cache, while methods (Hooper et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023; Monea et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024a; Yi et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024b; Sun et al., 2024a; Elhoushi et al., 2024; Svirschevski et al., 2024) like Draft & Verify (Zhang et al., 2023) use layer skipping or early exits to reuse parts of the target model’s parameters.', '6Conclusion', 'In this paper, we introduce EAGLE-3. Building upon EAGLE, EAGLE-3 incorporates two key im-provements. First, it removes the feature prediction constraint, instead directly predicting draft tokens through a Training-time test. Second, it replaces the use of the target model’s top-layer features with a fusion of the target model’s lower, middle, and upper-layer features to obtain richer informa-tion. With these improvements, EAGLE-3 contin-ues to benefit from the augmentation of training data, achieving a maximum speedup of 6.5x.', 'Vanilla:We use models from the Hugging-face.transformers library with the PyTorch backend and pre-allocated KV cache. Other methods also use these models as their base.', '(Standard) Speculative Sampling: We use the assisted generation feature from the HuggingFace Transformers library.', 'PLD, Lookahead, Medusa, and Hydra: We use the default settings and the officially released weights.', 'EAGLE: Vicuna and LLaMA2-Chat draft mod-els use the officially released weights, while LLaMA3-Instruct is trained using the ShareGPT dataset (consistent with Medusa and Hydra).', 'EAGLE-2: For the 7B (8B), 13B, and 70B orig-inal LLMs, we set the total number of draft tokens to 60, 50, and 48, respectively, with a draft tree depth of 6, and select 10 nodes during the expan-sion phase.']

Moreover, the dilution condition should be applied to suppress the concurrent chain extension. In consequence, this bimolecular process is now recognized as a less attractive choice for the preparation of cyclic polymers in practice (Scheme 1A).', '@', '@', 'A significantly improved means by an alternative unimolecular process has subsequently been introduced to prepare cyclic polymers (Scheme 1B).

This unimolecular process with asymmetrically functional telechelic precursors has been extended by employing alternative pairs of the reactive groups. Thus, an a-amino-u-carboxyl polystyrene and poly(tert-butyl acrylate) were prepared through a living polymerization using an initiator having a protected amino group, followed by the end-capping reaction to introduce a carboxylic group.8 The resulting asymmetric telechelic precursor underwent, after the deprotection, an intramolecular amidation reaction to give a ring polymer product effectively. Alternatively, an a-(furan-pro-tected)-maleimide-u-cyclopentadienylpoly(methylmethacry-late) and poly(tert-butyl acrylate) were prepared through the ATRP using a protected maleimide initiator and the subsequent introduction of a cyclopentadienyl group at the living end with the nickelocene methodology.9 The obtained asymmetric tele-chelic precursor was subjected to the heat treatment to cause the spontaneous deprotection followed by an intramolecular Diels–Alder addition reaction to give a ring polymer product effectively.9 It is notable, however, that these processes using telechelic precursors having potentially reactive groups require multistep protection/deprotection treatments.', 'A versatile unimolecular process has recently been introduced by employing a click reaction using asymmetrically functional telechelic polystyrene having an alkyne and an azide group.10 The introduction of these two functional groups at the polymer chain-ends could be performed conveniently, and they can react with each other upon the addition of a Cu catalyst.11 Therefore, this click polymer cyclization has been applied to prepare such functional ring polymers, as poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide)12,13and poly(caprolactone)14 as well as poly(valerolactone)15 to elucidate their topology-effect on phase transition, and on biodegradation, respectively, detailed in the later section. This unimolecular click process has also been employed to construct complex cyclic structures, either having multiple polymer segment components16 or having multicyclic as well as cyclic/ linear hybrid polymer segments.17 On the other hand, the bimo-lecular click process using an azide-ended bifunctional telechelic precursor and a bifunctional alkyne compound as a linking reagentproceedslesseffectivelythantheunimolecular counterpart.18', 'Another effective unimolecular process has been developed using symmetrically functional telechelic precursors, which are readily obtainable through a direct end-capping reaction of living bifunctional polymers (Scheme 1C).18–23 Thus, telechelic poly(tetrahydrofuran), poly(acrylic ester) and poly(isobutene) having olefinic end groups were prepared through the relevant living polymerization followed by the end-capping reaction. The subsequent metathesis condensation, i.e., metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC), in the presence of a Grubbs catalyst pro-ceeded effectively to give the corresponding ring polymers in high yields even under dilution.18–20 This MPC process has further been applied for the practical synthesis of amphiphilic cyclic block copolymers21 as well as of multi-cyclic polymers.22,23 This unimolecular process using symmetrically functional telechelic precursors has been extended by alternative telechelic precursors having either alkyne groups for Glaser condensation or having bromobenzyl groups for a radical coupling process.24,25', 'Ring polymers are obtainable alternatively through a direct ring-expansion polymerization, in which the successive insertion of monomers into a cyclic initiator proceeds to form a ring polymer structure (Scheme 1D). This process does not require dilution in contrast to the end-to-end polymer cyclization process by linear polymer precursors, while a reactive initiator fragment is inherently included in the final ring polymer structure. Thus until recently, the ring-expansion process has been considered as a less practical means, since it is not an easy task to maintain the ring topology of the product while eliminating the initiator residues.26', 'A number of new processes have recently been developed to address this problem in the ring-expansion polymerization (Scheme 2). Thus, a new Ru catalyst bearing a cyclic ligand containing the Ru-alkylidene unit has been introduced and applied for the ring-expansion polymerization of cyclic olefins such as 1,5-cyclooctadiene or cyclooctene.27 During the chain-growth process, the chain transfer to the Ru-alkylidene unit took place to eliminate the initiator complex, and consequently a ring polybutadiene or a ring poly(cyclooctene) free of the catalyst fragment, respectively, is produced. The obtained ring poly(cyclooctene)wasthenhydrogenatedtogivearing polyethylene, showing distinctive properties in comparison with commercial linear polyethylenes (Scheme 2A).27,28 It is notable, at the same time, that the random nature of this chain transfer process inherently causes the broadening of the molecular weight distribution of the product. This process has now been applied with a bulky, dendronized monomer to construct a ring nano-object directly observable by atomic force microscopy (AFM).29', 'More recently, a new N-heterocyclic carbene initiator was introduced for the ring-expansion polymerization of lactones or lactide to form ring polyesters or polylactide, respectively (Scheme 2B).30,31 Remarkably, the obtained ring polymers possess narrow molecular weight distributions through the elimination of the initiator fragment after the quantitative consumption of the monomer, in contrast to the metathesis ring-expansion process shown before.28 By exploiting the living character, this technique has subsequently been applied for the synthesis of ring block polypeptoids and of complex topological polymers having a ring with many branches, i.e., jellyfish poly-mers.32,33 A further development of the ring-expansion process would provide a wider variety of chemical structures in ring polymers by broadening the choice of monomer types.', 'The combination of the classical ring-expansion polymeriza-tion process, in which the initiator fragment is included within the ring polymer structure, with the end-to-end polymer cycli-zation process could provide a new effective means for ring polymers having, in particular, large sizes (Scheme 2C).34 Thus, a ring poly(caprolactone) having short photocrosslinkable block segments was prepared through a sequential living ring-expan-sion polymerization using a cyclic stannate initiator. The subsequent irradiation under dilution caused the intramolecular covalent linking of the two short segments. The subsequent removal of the stannate group produced a chemically stable ring polymer product, though the exact chemical structure of the linking units is obscure.34', '@', '@', 'By employing this methodology, a high-molecular weight ring poly(chloroethyl vinyl ether) was prepared and was subjected to the grafting-onto reaction using a living polystyrene, to form a densely grafted large ring polymer product as a nanoobject, which was directly observable by the AFM.35,36 On the other hand, the AFM showed a large fraction of uncyclized, linear polymer components remained in the crude cyclization products, revealing the inherent difficulty of the end-to-end cyclization of polymer precursors of high molecular weights. It is remarkable, moreover, that a small portion of nanoobjects corresponding to complex ring polymers having tadpole, 8-shaped, catenated and knotted forms were also identified. This showed, for the first time, that not only single-cyclic but also various complex cyclic polymer topologies are indeed produced through the polymer cyclization process, as previously shown in DNA systems.37', 'An electrostatic self-assembly and covalent fixation (ESA-CF) process has been introduced for the effective synthesis of not only cyclic but also functionalized cyclic and multicyclic polymers, where linear or star telechelic polymers having cyclic ammonium salt groups accompanying small or polymeric plurifunctional carboxylate counteranions are employed as key precursors (Scheme 1E).38–40 Various telechelic polymers have been conve-niently prepared through the relevant living polymerization fol-lowed by the end-capping/end-conversion technique. The choice of such particular types of cyclic ammonium salt end groups as five- and six-membered cyclic ammonium, i.e., N-phenyl-pyrrolidinium and N-phenylpiperidinium salt groups, respec-tively, is of a crucial importance in the ESA-CF process (Scheme 3).41 The former undergoes upon heating a selective ring-opening reaction by a carboxylate counteranion to form an amino ester group through the nucleophilic attack exclusively at the N-adjacent ring (endo) position. On the other hand, the latter having unstrained six-membered cyclic ammonium salt groups gives a chemically more stable, simple ester group through the nucleophilic attack at the alternative N-adjacent (exo) position, to eliminate N-phenylpiperidine.', 'And in the electrostatic polymer self-assembly, the cations at the end of the telechelics and the anions in the carboxylates counteranions always balance the charges. Upon the dilution, the self-assembly tends to dissociate into one having the smallest number of polymer components by keeping the balance of the charges (Scheme 4). Thus, when a self-assembly comprised of a linear telechelic precursor, typically poly(THF), having cyclic ammonium salt groups accompanying either a dicarboxylate or a tetracarboxylate counteranion was heated at dilution, the selective ring-opening reaction of the cyclic ammonium groups took place to produce single-cyclic (ring) or dicyclic (8-shaped) polymerproducts,respectively,inhighyields.38,42Ring poly(THF)s having the molecular weights of up to 10 000, cor-responding to the ring size of as high as 700 atoms, were obtainable and characterized unequivocally by the MALDI-TOF mass technique. Furthermore, the ESA-CF process with dynamic equilibrium nature has been exploited to construct various multicyclic as well as cyclic-linear hybrid polymer topologies (Scheme 5).6', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Moreover, ring polymers possessing the prescribed functional groups at the designated positions, i.e., kyklo-telechelics and cyclic macromonomer, have also been prepared by employing telechelic precursors possessing such functional groups as hydroxyl, olefinic, acetylenic, and azide groups at the designated, typically a center, position by using the relevant initiator, or by introducing functional linking reagents.43 They were subse-quently applied to construct more complex polymer topologies either through the covalent linkage or even through the non-covalent, mechanical linkage uniquely formed by threading with ring polymer units.44,45 It was also shown that network polymers formed from cyclic polymer precursors exhibited unique gel properties compared with conventional gels obtained with linear/ branched polymer precursors.46 Moreover, the topological conversion of polymers between ring/linear and even between single-cyclic/dicyclic topologies has now been achieved.45,47,48', 'By the combination of the ESA-CF protocol with selective covalent linking chemistry, a wide variety of multi-cyclic as well as cyclic-linear conjugated polymers have been synthesized.49 In particular, the combination of the ESA-CF process with the metathesis condensation and with the click process has now been revealed as a versatile means to construct a variety of complex multicyclic polymer topologies of fused-, spiro- and bridged forms (Scheme 6).50 Both the functional ring polymer precursors and thecovalentlylinkedmulticyclicpolymerproductwere unequivocally characterized by means of a series of spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques including MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy and SEC. As shown in Fig. 1, for a typical example, the structure of the polymer products having complex multicyclic topologies is convincingly demonstrated. The ESA-CF process has further been applied for the effective synthesis of topologi-cally unique polymer catenanes comprised of large polymer rings51 through the two orthogonal non-covalent interactions, namely the electrostatic and the hydrogen-bond interactions (Scheme 5).45', '@', '@', '3.Topology effects by cyclic polymers: depleting the chain-ends and beyond', 'In contrast to linear or branched polymer topologies, ring polymer topologies are uniquely defined by their absence of the chain ends.3,5 As recognized by the typical case of glass transition temperature (Tg), the topology effect of ring polymers is thus arisen from the depletion of the end-groups of polymer segments. Thus, the Tg of ring polymers is higher than the linear counter-part, until the polymer chain length becomes long enough to diminish the contribution of the chain end. On the contrary, the hydrodynamic volume or the melt viscosity of ring polymers is inherently smaller than their linear counterparts irrespective of their chain lengths. This indicates the distinctive conception in the topology effect by ring polymers. The latter is regarded as an inherent topology effect by ring polymers, while the former as the depletion effect of the polymer chain ends. Nevertheless, the elimination of the chain ends of polymer molecules inevitably leads to the formation of cyclic constructions to bring the topology effect, now drawing increasing interests to discover unusual properties and functions in polymer materials covering mechanical, thermal, electric, photonic and bio-related applica-tions either in bulk or at surface. From an experimental point of view, moreover, further developments are awaited to provide ring polymers possessing high molecular weights with guaran-teed purity, since the mixing of even small amount of linear counterpartmightcauseinconclusiveorevenerroneous conclusions on the topology effect by ring polymers.', '4.Topology effects on basic polymer properties: simulations and experiments from simple to complex cyclic polymers', 'Basic characteristics of single-cyclic (ring) homopolymers either in solution or bulk, in static or dynamic states, have extensively been studied and documented relevantly.3 Therefore, recent studies have elaborated either on specific polymers of practical importance like polyethylenes,52 on specific chain characteristics like semiflexible to stiff nature,53 or on multicomponent polymer systemstypicallyblockcopolymers.54Notably,moreover, theory and simulation studies have increasingly focused on multi-cyclic complex polymers, obviously promoted by synthetic developments on complex topological polymers.55–57 Unique topological polymer properties envisaged by the simulation studies are now to be verified experimentally using relevant topological polymers. Indeed, a collaborative simulation and experimental study on the liquid chromatography study has been conducted on multi-cyclic polymers, and could provide a basis for the purification and the characterization of polymers having complex topologies.58', '@', '@', 'The diffusion behavior is of particular interest in view of the topology effects on polymer molecules, since the self-diffusion of linear and branched polymers follows the reptation mechanism, a snake-like translational motion, in which the polymer chain ends tend to command the motion of their in-chain segments.59Cyclic polymers are unique, on the other hand, in the absence of chain ends, and their non-reptation dynamics has been a subject of both theory/simulation and experimental studies.60', 'A single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy is a unique means to observe directlythe motion of single polymer molecules.61 Thus, the ESA-CF process was applied with mono- and bifunctional telechelic poly(THF) precursors having N-phenylpiperidinium (six-membered ring) groups possessing a perylene dicarboxylate counteranion, to produce ring and linear poly(THF)s having a perylene unit applicable to the single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy measurement (Scheme 7).62', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The subsequent single-molecule imaging was conducted to observe the real-time motion of individual polymer molecules. The video-recording of the motion of single-molecule fluores-cence images, followed by the computational analysis could provide the position and trajectory of the object on the x–y plane as shown in Fig. 2. The histograms of the distribution of the individual diffusion constant were subsequently obtained from large enough datasets of these consecutive images. Upon the statistical analysis of the distribution patterns, a bimodal diffu-sion mechanism was disclosed for ring polymers, corresponding to either threaded or non-threaded conditions in a linear mole-cule matrix. In contrast, the unimodal diffusion was indicated for the linear counterpart (Fig. 3).', 'As shown above, the significant topology effects could be envisaged in polymer properties involving their diffusion process. In this respect, the crystallization dynamics is of a considerable interest since the diffusion and the conformational trans-formation of polymer molecules could dictate the folding and packing of polymer segments in the crystal lattice. To elucidate the topology effect in the crystallization process, a defect-free ring poly(THF) was prepared together with the linear counterpart having the precisely relevant chemical structure.63 Thus, a living bifunctional poly(THF) was terminated with sodium allyloxide to give a telechelic precursor having allyl end groups. The subsequent metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC) with a Grubbs catalyst under dilution, followed by the hydrogenation of the unsaturated linking group afforded a defect-free ring poly(THF), consisting exclusively of oxytetramethylene units (Scheme 8). The isothermal crystallization experiments showed the slower crystallization rate for ring poly(THF)s ascribed to their topologically constrained conformation (Fig. 4). Moreover,', '@', '@', '@', '@ distinctive crystal morphologies are produced, in particular a banded structure in the spherulites exclusively for the ring poly (THF) but not for the linear counterpart. The crystallization kinetics of ring poly(3-caprolactone)s has recently been reported by several groups.64 The faster crystallization rate was observed for ring polymers than the linear counterpart in contrast to the case of poly(THF), and was ascribed to the higher diffusion of ring polymers than their linear counterparts.64', '@', '@', '@', '@', '5.Topology effects by ring polymers in self-assemblies', 'The topology effects by ring polymers could be amplified in their assembled states rather than in their individually separated forms. Therefore, micelles formed by ring polymers should be of a remarkable interest. Thus, a series of micelles were prepared with amphiphilic cyclic AB block copolymers, comprised of eitherpoly(butyleneoxide)/poly(ethyleneoxide)orpoly (propylene oxide)/poly(ethylene oxide), together with their linear AB, linear ABA block copolymer counterparts.65–67 The cyclic block copolymer employed in this study was prepared by a bimolecular process using the hydroxy-terminated linear block copolymer and dichloromethane as a linking reagent in the presence of KOH, to form an acetal linking unit (Scheme 9A).', 'The critical micelle concentration (cmc) of the micelle with the cyclic AB block copolymer was similar to or marginally smaller than those with the linear ABA counterparts. On the contrary, the corresponding micelle with the linear AB counterpart showed a significantly smaller cmc. Moreover, the association number (Nw), thermodynamic radius (rt), and hydrodynamic radius (rh) of the micelle with the cyclic AB block copolymers and with the linear ABA counterparts were comparable to each other, but distinctively smaller than those with the linear AB counterparts. These results are consistent with the geometric estimation of the size of the micelles, corresponding to the Nw, rt, and rh, which is dependent on the continuous chain length of the hydrophobic segment in the block copolymers. And, those in the cyclic AB and the linear ABA block copolymers are estimated as a half of that in the linear AB counterpart employed in this study. Moreover, the cyclic AB block copolymer tends to constitute a stiff hairpin-like conformation, resulting in a slightly larger hydrophobic core within the micelle compared to that with the linear ABA coun-terpart having free chain ends. The enthalpy of micellization (DmicH�) was also smaller with the cyclic AB block copolymer than that with the corresponding linear ABA counterpart, presumably because the segmental flip-flop is inhibited in the micelle with the former, in contrast to the motional freedom by the latter having free chain ends. This also agrees with the smaller entropy of micellization (DmicS�) with the cyclic AB block copolymer than with the linear counterpart.', '@', '@', 'More recently, a significant topology effect has been revealed in the thermal stability of the micelle formed with cyclic AB block copolymers in comparison with the linear ABA and even with the linear AB counterparts.68 Notably, a variety of relevant cyclic lipids, thus a type of surfactants, have been discovered in the cell membrane of thermophilic archaea, single-cell microorganisms, surviving in the hostile environment of very high-temperatures located at hot springs and submarine volcanoes.69 Thus, an amphiphilic cyclic AB block copolymer, comprised of poly(butyl acrylate)/poly(ethylene oxide) segments, was prepared. The unimolecular, metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC) process was employed using a linear ABA block copolymer precursor having olefinic end groups (Scheme 9B).21', 'The obtained cyclic and the relevant linear block copolymers were allowed to form the corresponding micelles, in which their cmc’s and the number-average hydrodynamic volumes (Dh) were measured to be closely comparable to each other (Fig. 5).68 The size and morphology of the micelles with either block copolymers were directly observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 6) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 6) to show commonly flower-like spherical shapes possessing the consistent diameters determined by DLS (Scheme 10).', 'Remarkably, the thermal stability of the micelles was drasti-cally enhanced using the cyclic block copolymer. Thus, the corresponding micelle solutions were heated from 20�C in a stepwise fashion (Fig. 7), and the micelle with the linear ABA block copolymer became turbid at around 25 �C, while that with the cyclic AB counterpart was stable till above 70 �C.68', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Based on the large deviation of the clouding point (Tc) among the micelles either solely with cyclic or with linear block copol-ymers, the tuning of the Tc of the micelle was achieved by the coassembly of both the linear and cyclic block copolymers.68Thus, the Tc was systematically altered along with the relative contents of the cyclic and the linear block copolymer compo-nents in the micelle, as shown in Fig. 7.68 This topology effect will be utilized to design temperature-responsive devices encapsu-lating and releasing appropriate components in and from the micelle. In particular, the topology-based polymer materials design should be suitable for human body-related applications including drug delivery system, food, and cosmetics, for which the modification of chemical structure and molecular weight mightinducereasonableconcernoverthetoxicityand biocompatibility.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '6.Topology effects by functional ring polymers having programmed chemical structures', 'Along with the introduction of new synthetic methodologies, an increasing variety of functional ring polymers and oligomers have become obtainable to exploit their topology effects. A number of recent studies are presented in this section, covering a diverse field either by conjugated cyclic oligomers,70 by photo-responsive ring polymers,71,72 by biodegradable ring polyesters,14by temperature-responsive ring polymers,12,13or by pharmaco-logically functional ring polymers.73', 'Conjugated polymers and oligomers have currently been extensively studied primarily due to their potential for diverse electronic and photonic applications.74 Ring-shaped conjugated polymers and oligomers have attracted particular interests as a prototype of the molecularly fabricated electric circuit, since the circulation of electrons/holes might be induced along the ‘‘endless’’ conjugated segments. A wide variety of conjugated ring oligomers possessing the increasing numbers of unsaturated groups have thus been prepared to test their electrochemical properties.70 Fully conjugated large ring polymers, on the other hand, have still been an elusive synthetic challenge. It is notable, moreover, that a twisted, Moebius stripe-like conjugated olig-omer has attracted considerable interests because of their unusual non-H€uckel aromaticity, in contrast to the conventional H€uckel-type aromaticity which is dependent on its planar geometry by conjugated units.75', 'Photo-response behaviors could be influenced by polymer topologies of either ring or linear forms. Thus, a ring polymer having photo-responsive azobenzene units in the main chain was prepared through the bimolecular end-to-end cyclization via click chemistry.71 Upon the irradiation of UV light, both the trans-to-cis and the cis-to-trans isomerization proceeded slightly faster by the ring polymer in comparison with the linear counterpart. This behavior was attributed to the higher topo-logical constraint of the former than the latter counterpart.71 As another example, a ring polystyrene having two photoactive groups, namely fluorene and anthracene units, was prepared through the bimolecular process using a living bifunctional polystyrene produced with an initiator having a fluorene unit and a linking reagent having an anthracene unit.72 The fluo-rescent behavior of the obtained ring polymer was subsequently studied to show the intramolecular energy migration between the two chromophores.72', 'Naturally occurring ring polymers, such as cyclic DNAs, cyclic peptides as well as cyclic polysaccharides,3 and multi-cyclic counterparts like cyclotides,76 are known to exhibit higher stability against biologically induced decomposition. In this relevance, the topology effect of aliphatic biodegradable poly-esters on their decomposition behavior has been investigated.14Thus, ring poly(caprolactone) was prepared through the unim-olecular click polymer cyclization using the corresponding precursor having an azide and an alkyne group. The higher hydrolytic stability was then observed in comparison with the linear counterparts.14 Notably, moreover, such biodegradable ring polyesters by poly(valerolactone) and by poly(lactide) were also prepared.15,30,31,77', 'Temperature-responsivepropertiesofpoly(N-iso-propylacrylamide), poly(NIPAM), have extensively been studied for their eventual uses in the controlled release devices and for the cell–sheet applications.78 The two groups recently reported the topology effects by ring poly(NIPAM)s.12,13 Thus, the two groups prepared linear poly(NIPAM) precursors having alkyne and azide end groups either by a reversible addition–fragmen-tation chain transfer (RAFT) or by an atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) technique, and the unimolecular click process was commonly applied for the subsequent polymer cyclization. The cloud point (TCP) of the obtained ring poly(NIPAM) by one group was several degrees higher than that of the corresponding linear counterpart. In addition, they observed that the phase transition by the ring polymers took place distinctively slower upon heating.12 Another group, on the other hand, observed the ring poly(NIPAM) showing a few degrees lower TCP against the linear counterpart at the higher solution concentration, while higher at the lower solution concentration. Furthermore, they reported the smaller enthalpy change (DH) during the phase transition with the ring poly (NIPAM). These results were accounted for by the suppression of the hydrogen bond interaction between the ring poly(NIPAM) with water molecules due to their topological constraints in comparison with the flexible linear counterpart having free chain ends.13', 'A pharmacological application of ring polymers has recently been demonstrated by elucidating the filtration/elimination mechanism of a kidney through its nanoporous channel.73 Thus, it was anticipated that the ring polymer could remain longer in a body than the linear counterpart, since the former should be reluctant to transform its conformation into a folded shape to traverse through the nanoporous channels of the kidney.73 To test this topology effect, a series of linear and cyclic poly(capro-lactone)s having poly(ethylene glycol) graft segments and having phenolic functionalities for radiolabeling by 125I were prepared. The lower secretion into urine and in turn the higher accumu-lation in various organs was indeed confirmed with the ring polymer having an appropriate molecular weight, corresponding to its hydrodynamic volume.73 These findings may provide new design methodologies for drug carriers and imaging agents via the topology-based control of a blood circulation time.', '7.Conclusions and future perspectives', 'In this review, we have shown a variety of recent achievements in topological polymer chemistry, to focus on novel polymer properties and functions uniquely revealed by ring polymers. The topology effects, in particular by ring polymers have now offered unique opportunities in polymer materials design unattainable by other means. A viable promise for the practical utilization of the topology effect undoubtedly includes the modification of any existing polymeric materials dependent mostly on linear poly-mers, inflicting little concern on chemical toxicity and environ-mentalpollution.Furthermore,broaderopportunitiesof topology effects by not only single-cyclic but also multi-cyclic polymers are expected in polymer chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, and materials science.', 'Acknowledgements', 'We thank Sekisui Chemical Grant Program for Research on Manufacturing Based on Learning from Nature (Y.T.), The Mitsubishi Foundation (Y.T.), Tokuyama Science Foundation (T.Y.), CASIO Science Promotion Foundation (T.Y.), The Japan Securities Scholarship Foundation (T.Y.), The Kurata Memorial Hitachi Science and Technology Foundation (T.Y.), and Yazaki Memorial Foundation for Science and Technology for financial support.

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25�C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 �C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 �10�4 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 �0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 �C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 �C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by significant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of �4 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers.', '�2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through proton exchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Nafion�as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18].', 'Transport properties and nanostructure of sulfonated polyimide (SPI) membranes have been studied using pulsed field gradient NMR and NMR quadrupolar relaxation rates determinations [19,20], and small angle scattering methods (SAXS and SANS), respectively [21,22].', 'The microstructure of sulfonated polyetherether ketone (sPEEK) has been investigated by SAXS [12]. We recently reported a class of ionomers based on aromatic hydrocarbon copolymers with high proton conductivity and excellent thermal mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states [22e29]. Sulfonated poly-arylenethioethersulfone(SPTES)copolymershavefollowing chemical structures (Fig. 1).', 'SPTES copolymers including SPTES-50, SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80, have equivalent weight (EW) and IEC (mequiv./g) values of 610, 515, 459, 417, and 1.64, 1.94, 2.18, and 2.4, respectively [22]. They exhibited proton conductivity of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm respectively, at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity [22]. Their excellent proton conductivity at high temperatures combined with their high glass transition temperature (w200 �C) and mechanical stability (both in the dry and hydrated states) make them excellent potentials as high temperature PEM materials for fuel cells. SPTES-50 copolymer membrane has successfully been fabricated to membrane electrode assemblies and exhibited polarization curves and durability up to 400 h [29]. Their successful operations at 90e100 �C were limited by boiling point of water (100 �C at 1 atm). Replacing water molecules with heterocycles such as imidazolium where the charge carrier has a very low vapor pressure can result in proton conductivity at higher temperatures. Despite excellent electrochemical properties, excessive water uptake of SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes provide difficulties to be made as membrane electrode assembly [22,27] The proton transport and performance of SPTES copolymers highly depend on the presence of water molecules. In addition to the number of sulfonic groups, their acidity (pKa) ability to dissociate water molecules to proton, water activity coefficient, and number of water molecules associated with each sulfonic group, the supermolecular structure of the hydro-phobic and hydrophilic phases is also defined by polymer chain characteristics such as chain persistent length, and presence of sulfonic group on the backbone or in the side chains. We reported the presence of ionic nanodomains containing water molecules in the SPTES-70 using in-situ x-ray scattering [27]. The morphology and the nanostructure of SPTES-50 were approximated by corre-lated polydisperse spherical aggregates and a larger scale water domain network and were quantified by modeling of the SANS spectra with polydisperse hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [29]. This study reports the nanostructure and morphology of sulfonated polyarylenethioethersulfone (SPTES) copolymer membranes which is directly related to the proton transport through the membrane in terms of their degree of sulfonation and temperature dependency.', '2. Materials and methods', '2.1. Materials', 'Visually observed defect free films of SPTES copolymers were prepared by dissolving the purified copolymer in dimethyl acet-amide (DMAc, Sigma Aldrich) (5e10 wt%) filtering, placing in a flat dish in a vacuum oven with a gradual temperature rise to 100 �C for 24 h and 120 �C for 2 h. The resulting uniform flat films were immersed for 2 h in deionized water and dried under vacuum (24 h, 80 �C) after they were acidified in sulfuric acid (4 M, 24 h) to ensure complete conversion of sulfonic groups to their protonated forms.', '2.2. Characterization', 'SANS experiments were performed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Neutron Center for Research using 30 m NG-7 SANS instrument with a neutron wavelength, l, of 6 Å (Dl/l ¼ 10%) and three sample-to-detector distance of 1.5 m, 10 m (l ¼ 6 Å), and 15 m (l ¼ 8 Å), 0.001 < q < 0.3168 Å�1 at 25, and 55 �C (accuracy of 0.5 �C). Hydrated membranes were placed in demountable 1 mm thick titanium liquid cells filled with D2O after equilibrium in D2O (24 h). Scattered intensities were reduced, corrected for the transmission and background and placed on absolute scale. Then, circularly averaged to produce absolute scale scattering intensity, I(q), as a function of the wave vector, q, where q ¼ (4p/l)sin(q/2) and q is the scattering angle. Calculations were performed using Igor Pro�software [30,31]. USANS experiments covered a q-range of 0.00005 < q (Å�1) < 0.01, corresponding to a real-space length scale of 0.1 microne10 micron.', '3. Results and discussions', '3.1. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 25 �C', 'SPTES copolymers have high proton conductivity at high relative humidities and elevated temperatures; e.g. 65 �C and 85% RH of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers, respectively [27]. The degree of sulfonation increases for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6%, respectively. SPTES-50 copolymer has the lowest the degree of sulfonation and SPTES-80 copolymer has the highest degree of sulfonation in this class of copolymers [22,27]. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers at 25 �C show a scattering behavior of a two phase structure (Fig. 2a). The contribution of sulfonic groups to the scattering is considered to be negligible due to their small volume compared to the polymer and the water phase volume. It was visually observed that membranes do not dissociate when fully hydrated in the examined temperature. It was also determined by weight measurement that the membranes maintain the weight after deswelling. Therefore, the hydrophobic polymeric structure is the supporting network even at high water content and increased temperatures. Fig. 2a presents enhanced scattering intensity data (vertically shifted) for the hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copol-ymer membranes in the order of 20X, 1000X, and 2 �105X for the clarity of data presentation. The absolute scale scattering intensities in the medium q range of 0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1 are almost in the same intensity range for all SPTES copolymers. The high q scattering spectra for all copolymers exhibit a feature which is attributed to the presence of ionic domains containing water molecules. According to the scattering results, the morphology of all hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C can be approximated as correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates with liquid-like ordering (P.Y. ordering) and a power law decay [29]. The scattering data for the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C were compared and quantified using polydisperse (Schulz polydispersity) hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [32e34] and a low q power law decay [29]. The modeling of the SPETS 50 nanostructure and its properties have been reported elsewhere but presented here for clarity and completeness of the SPTES series analysis [29]. Fig. 2b shows the experimental scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 25 �C compared with the theoretical calculations of the model (solid line). The results of the comparison of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes scattering data with the model are summarized in Table 1. According to this modeling the domain radius increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 13.45,14.9,15.4, and 16.9 Å for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes. The hard sphere packing density increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 19.8%, 23%, 25%, 29% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. This could indicate that ionic domains are capable of holding more water molecules with the presence of more sulfonic groups on the polymer backbone (increasing the degree of sulfonation). The high-q scattering spectra exhibits onset of a peak formation when the degree of sulfonation was increased to 71.6% for SPTES-80 copolymer. Pres-ence of scattering maxima can be due to the scattering from an ordered structure (periodicity) or the oscillations resulted from the structural factor effects or the excluded volume effect arising from short range liquid-like ordering. The onset of peak formation is attributed to the excluded volume effects related to the liquid-like ordering [33e35]. The low-q power law decay of nearly �3 was observed for all SPTES copolymers in the range of 1 �10�4 < q (1/ Å) < 3 �10�3. The power law decay of �3 is attributed to the presence of interacting three-dimensional fractal morphology. In addition, a Guinier plateau [35] was present for the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer at the very low q (q (1/Å) < 9 �10�5). This is in addition to the nearly identical scattering intensity in the inter-mediate q-range (0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1). It can be concluded that the change in the degree of sulfonation had little or no effect on the intermediate and low angle scattering wave vector. The low-q power law decay was nearly �3 �0.1 for all SPTES copolymers. The presence of sharp interface between hydrophobic and hydro-philic domains was deduced from the power law decay of �4 at large angle wave vectors for all hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes. All scattering data presented in Fig. 2a shows a power slope of �3.85 to �4.15 which is approximated as w �4. The presence of Porod behavior (decay of �4) has been attributed to the two immiscible phase with a sharp boundary [35e37]. This shows that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are separated with a distinct interface containing sulfonic groups.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Presence of a plateau in the scattering spectra is characteristics of isolated scatterers [35]. The radius of gyration (Rg) of the isolated scatterers can be approximated by IðqÞ ¼ I0expðð�q2R2gÞ=3Þ, where I0 is the extrapolated zero scattering intensity (Guinier approxi-mation) [35]. Presence of the Guinier plateau in the q range of 4.3 �10�5 < q (1/Å) < 8.2 �10�5 for SPTES-80 copolymer suggests segregation of the isolated large scale hydrophilic water pockets when the degree of sulfonation increased to 71.6%. Radius of gyration of the isolated larger scale water pockets in fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was 1.3 �0.18 micron which was calculated from this approximation (Fig. 2c).', '@', '@', '3.2. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 55 �C', 'Based on the physical observations, water saturated membranes at 55 �C were swollen films without visual dissociation. Fig. 3 exhibits the scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. The inter-mediate scattering intensity decreased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes start to form scattering maxima at high q range when the degree of sulfonation increased. This indicated the increase in the excluded volume due to the increase in the volume of the scatterers at higher degree of sulfonation and increased temperature (55 �C). The presence of scattering maxima is more significant for SPTES-70 copolymer and SPTES-80 copolymer with 63.3 and 71.6% degree of sulfonation. The large angle scattering feature shows scattering maxima at qmax of 0.103 and 0.1108 1/Å for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers which correspond to spatial characteristics lengths (l ¼ 2p/qmax) of 60.97 and 56.7 Å due to concentration fluctuations of hydrated domains (hard spheres). The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes changed significantlywith increasing degree of sulfonation. This indicates a substantial change in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology with increasing degree of sulfonation at 55 �C which is more pronounced for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers (degree of sulfonation 63.3 and 71.6%, respectively). Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are segregated distinctly by the sulfonic groups at the interface which is repre-sented by the Porod behavior, asymptotic behavior of w �4 for all SPTES copolymers [35e37]. The morphology of these membranes is complex and controlled by interfacial phenomena. The number of sulfonic groups per repeat unit volume and their acidity com-plemented with the chain persistent length and chain mobility are governing factors in the formed morphology. This study approxi-mates the morphology of the fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55 �C are approximated as spherical nanodomains containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering similar to their morphology at 25 �C. It is also proposed that this morphology changedtofractalmorphologywithincreasing temperature (increasing the intermediate scattering decay). The domain radius and the sphere packing density were increased from 26.4 Å and 28% for SPTES-50 copolymer to 32 Å and 33% for SPTES-60copolymerwhiletheintermediatescatteringintensity decreased. The domain radius and packing density of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane increased from 13.45 Å and 19.8% to 26.4 Å and 28% when the temperature increased from 25 �C to 55 �C with this approximation. The same increasing trend of 14.9 Åe32 Å for the average domain radius and 23%e33% of the sphere packing density was observed. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane compared to the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane is attributed to the disruption of the large scale morphology. The low q power law decay of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane was close to the decay of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane.', 'The increase in the degree of sulfonation of SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymers from 54.9, to 63.3 and 71.6% resulted in a shift in the position of the high q scattering maxima of the hydrated membranes toward the large angle scattering regime. This peak formation is more prominent for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copoly-mers with higher sulfonation degree. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering intensity in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers is attributed to the loss of the large scale water network, intermediate fractal morphology within the polymer and onset of a morphology change to a two large scale phase morphology. The closed domain morphology of polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with fractal network were present for fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55�C (Figs. 3 and 4a). However, substantialchangesinthemorphologyoffullyhydrated membranes occurred when the degree of sulfonation is increased to 63.3 and 71.6% for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers at higher temperature of 55 �C. Combination of high temperature, high density of sulfonic groups, and significant amount of water mole-cules within the polymer backbone could have resulted in the coalescence of the small spherical ionic domains and fractal water network into a larger scale bicontinuous network of intermeshed hydrophobic and hydrophilic morphology for fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane at 55 �C. The bicontinuous model origi-nally proposed for micro-emulsion of two immiscible phases of water and oil with comparable amount based on Landau theory [38,39]. This model describes two irregular shapes with distinct boundary and has been used for intermesh of hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure when the particle shape is not well-defined [40,41]. This model proposes I(q) ¼ (a2þc1q þ c2q2)�1 for a2 > 0, c1 < 0, and c2 > 0, a single broad scattering maxima, and power law decay of �4 at large scattering angles. Two characteristics lengths of d and x are deduced from this analysis having a2, c1, and c2[39,40], d is the domain periodicity or interdomain distance and x is the correlation length which has been attributed to the dispersion of d. According to this theory, c1 is negative due to the surfactant. The absolute values of c1 and the ratio of x/d should increase with increasing surfactant. The specific internal surface area can be derived from the ratio of S/V ¼ 44(1�4)/x [38,39].', 'The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane has a low-q upturn, a lower intermediate scattering intensity compared to the hydrated SPTES-60 and SPTES-50 copolymers, and a large angle maxima followed by a power law decay of �4. This indicates the onset of the coalescence of the ionic aggregates, disruption of the fractal water network, and the formation of the two irregular large scale bicontinuous phase morphology. The high q range (q > 0.037 1/Å) of the scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 55 �C was compared with the T.S. bicontinuous model (Fig. 4b). This simulation resulted in a periodicity, d, of 59.9 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima position, 60.97 Å. According to this simulation, the correlation length (x) is 31.14 Å. The medium-q range scattering still exhibits the larger scale morphology which is not completely converted to the bi-continuous phase morphology. However, they are partially collapsed characterized by a lower scattering intensity in the intermediate q range. The high q maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 is approximated as bicontinuous morphology. The low and medium q (q < 0.037 1/Å) scattering spectra of the SPTES 70 is due to the presence of fractal network of waters which have not coalesce yet.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The scattering spectra of the SPTES-80 copolymer are consistent with a bicontinuous two phase structure of irregular shapes with sulfonic groups as interfacial ionic region. The scattering experi-mental data of the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was compared with this model (q > 0.015 1/Å), (Fig. 4c and Table 2). The periodicity of the water domains (or hydrophobic domains), d, predicted by this model is w54 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima (qmax), 56.7 Å. This value is the distance between water domains. The correlation length (x) obtained from this model is 37.86 Å which is a measure of dispersion.', 'The distance between the water phases, periodicity, was decreased from 59.9 Å to 54 Å with increasing degree of sulfona-tion. The correlation length, x, was increased from 31.14 Å to 37.86 Å when the degree of sulfonation increased. Increasing the interfacial area results in an increase in the x/d ratio. The presence of the upturn in the low range of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 at 55 �C (Fig. 4b and c) is attributed to the fractal morphology of the large scale features.', '3.3. Discussions', 'Scattering data of series of SPTES membranes were obtained in the full hydration state with increasing the sulfonation degree in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. Complete study was performed to provide understanding membranes morphology with increasing the temperature of the hydrated membranes from 25 �C to 55 �C. Proposed model assumes spherical nanodomains containing water molecules forming from clustering of the sulfonation groups. This assumption was performed based on previously reported study which showed spherical nanodomains in the dry SPTES 50 membrane under HR-TEM [29]. The scattering spectra of the membranes with high degree of sulfonation (SPTES 70, and 80) changed significantly when the temperature increased to 55 �C. The morphology is approximated as bi-continuous system where the hydrocarbon is the main support network containing water. This model has been recently proposed by Wnek et al. [40], Gebel [8], and Kreuer [12], Wnek also provided visualization of the hydro-phobic cluster using SYBYL version 6.7 (Tripos) and HINT (Hydro-pathicINTeractions)computationalmodelingsoftware[40]. Despite the support of the transport studies of this model [42], there is no direct visualization method for this proposed approxi-mation. The T. S. model is also supported by high proton conduc-tivity of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 membranes at 55 �C where a larger number of hydronium ions in a larger domain can facilitate proton transport. A summary of the structural evolution of the SPTES membranes as a function of temperature and degree of sulfonation is illustrated in Table 3. This study attempted to study a full range of SPTES membrane nanostructure for the first time and provide an understanding of large membrane water uptakes, and their morphology and their relation with high conductivity of the membranes using both liquid like ordering of polydisperse nano-spheres and bi-continuous T.S. model approximation.', '@', '@', 'Table 3 Summary of membrane structural changes (SPTES 50, 60, 70, and 80 at 25 �C, and SPTES 50 and 60 at 55 �C) as a function of degree of sulfonation and temperature by polydisperse hard sphere model with liquid-like ordering ordering). T.S. bi-continuous model was approximated for higher sulfonation degree copolymers, SPTES 70 and 80, at 55 �C.', '@', '4. Conclusions', 'A series of SPTES copolymers with high proton conductivity of 100e215 mS/cm at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity as potential fuel cells membranes were studied. SANS studies of fully hydrated membranes showed that the nanostructure of the fully hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C in agreement with ionic aggregates containing water molecules with a large scale morphology network of water pockets morphology. This model predicted that the increase in the degree of sulfonation resulted in an increase in the radius of ionic domains and an increase in the volume packing density of water in the aggregates. It was assumed that the same morphology of polydisperse correlated spherical ionic domains were present in the SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymers when the temperature increased to 55 �C. Increase in the degree of sulfonation for fully hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer at 55 �C led to a substantial reorganization of the membrane morphology which was described by a bi-continuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic network.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to thank the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Nano-structured andBiological Materials Branch forfunding this research.

And polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared through radical polymerization of 1-vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface-vinylated nanoparticles. The polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were utilized as a functional additive to prepare PPBI/polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. Imida-zole and sulfonated vinylbenzene groups on the surface of modified nanoparticles forming linkages with PPBI chains, improved the compatibility between PPBI and nanoparticles, and enhanced the mechanical strength of the prepared nanocomposite membranes. The prepared nanocomposite membranes showed higher water uptake and acid doping levels comparing to PPBI. Also, after acid doping with phosphoric acid, nanocomposite membranes exhibited enhanced proton conductivity in comparison to the pristine PPBI and PPBI/un-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. The enhancement in proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes resulted from modified SiO2 nanoparticles showed higher conductivity than modified TiO2 nanoparticles. The above results indicated that the PPBI/modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for medium temperature fuel cells.', '© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang- ers [1–3]. Sulfonated polysulfone (PSF) [4], polyetheretherketone (PEEK) [5,6] and polybenzimidazoles (PBIs) [7–11] are among poly-mers which can be used as alternatives for Nafion in PEFCs.', 'Amongpolybenzimidazolederivatives,poly[2,2-5,5(m-phenylene)-bibenzimidazole](PBI),whichisalsocalled commercial polybenzimidazole have been used as a mem-brane material in PEMFCs. Having high chemical as well as thermal resistance and proton conductivity, polybenzimidazoles are great options to be used in the fuel cells with function at elevated temperatures above 100 ◦C [12].', 'PBIs should have enough proton conductivity so that it could be used as proton exchange membranes in the fuel cells. To achieve this purpose, they are usually doped with a sufficient acid like H3PO4 to an appropriate doping level [13]. Nanocomposite membranes are a new group of membranes which contain nanopar-ticles such as SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 and other compounds [14–21]. The introduction of nanoparticles into the membranes results in a considerable improvement in their features like mechani-cal properties, methanol permeability, but in some cases leads to a decrease in proton conductivity [22–24]. In order to over-come this problem, surface functionalized nanoparticles, which means various compounds with polar groups grafted chemically to the surface of the nanoparticles [25–28], were used. As men-tioned before, the numerous research works were done concerning grafting various compounds on the SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles which used for different purposes. However, in this work, we have used monomer bearing functional groups like imidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene which can improve the properties of pro-ton conductive membranes. These monomers are polymerized on the surface of the nanoparticles and as a consequence, they can more affect the properties of the membranes than while one functional group is grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. In addition, the polymerization of the selected monomers such as vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface of nanoparticle could cause more compatibility between nanopar-ticles and polymer matrix which finally improve the mechanical properties. In this work, nanocomposite membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles and newly synthesized polybenzimidazole was depicted poly[2,2-5,5-(m-pyrazolidene)-bibenzimidazole] (PPBI). Modification of the mentioned nanoparticles was performed by radical polymerization of some vinyl monomers such as sulfonated styrene and vinylim-idazole on the surface of the nanoparticles to which vinylic group was bounded covalently. Also, the effect of surface modification on the properties of the nanocomposite membranes such as pro-ton conductivity, mechanical properties and water uptake were studied.', '@', '@', '2.

The absence of absorbent peak related to amine group proton (N–H) in the area of 4.0–5.0 ppm and an absorbent related to amide group in the area of 10.3–10.6 ppm show the complete closure of imidazole rings during the polycondensation reaction.', 'In FT-IR characteristics of PPBI, the presence of absorbent bands in 800 cm−1 is related to the vibration of C–H bond of imida-zole, a band in about 1300 cm−1 is related to the vibration of C–N bond of imidazole, the absorbent band in 1450 cm−1 is related to C N and C C vibrations and bands in the area of 3400 cm−1 and 3140 cm−1 are related to N–H vibrations.

Also the peaks in 1619 and 1419 cm−1 can be due to C C and C N bonds. In Fig. 4(c), the presence of the absorbent band in 1257 cm−1 is cor-responded to S O bond of the sulfonic acid group.

The FT-IR spectrum of the obtained powder did not show any absorbent bands related to PVI and PSV chains. The absorbent bands, which existed in the spectrum of mod-ified nanoparticles, were not observed in this spectrum. So, it was indicated that the polymeric chains have been attached to the par-ticles surface via covalent bonds.', '3.2. Thermal analysis', 'Thermogravimetric analysis diagrams of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 5. Weight loss in 85 ◦C can be related to the release of physically absorbed water. In un-modified nanoparticles, the minor weight loss in elevated temperatures can be attributed to the loss of hydroxyl groups of the particle surface attached by covalent bonds. Weight loss in modified nanoparticles could be a result of thermal degradation of the polymeric chains grafted to the surface of the nanoparti-cles. Also, the weight loss in 230–300 ◦C was due to the thermal decomposition of the sulfonate groups in the grafted PSV chains [30].', 'Thermograms of PVI modified nanocomposite with 5, 10 and 15% of TiO2 are shown in Fig. 6. As it is observed, the thermal prop-erties of the nanocomposites prepared with various amounts of TiO2 are almost similar.

This decrease in weight in comparison with the theoretical amount could be related due to the degradation of the chains grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. Also, in order to obtain the par-ticular weight of the modified nanoparticles, specific amounts of modified and un-modified nanoparticles were weighed after and before complete burning out all the polymers. They were heated to temperatures about 1000 ◦C for 30 min and the obtained nanoparti-cles were weighed immediately. The difference between the weight of un-modified nanoparticles before and after heating shows the amount of lost water which was either physically absorbed or pro-duced from the condensation reaction of the hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticle surface. Also from the difference between the weight of modified nanoparticles before and after heating and consider- ing the weight of lost water, the percentage of the grafted polymer onto the nanoparticle surface was obtained. The obtained results and theoretical amounts are shown in Table 1. The amounts of the obtained results in all cases are more than theoretical values.

As a result, the addition of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles do not have any noticeable effect on thermal stability of the prepared nanocomposites.', 'As it is observed in Fig. 7, the degradation of PVI-modified nanoparticles occurs at 185 ◦C which is lower than the related tem-perature of PSV-modified ones. Therefore, the former one can be used in fuel cells with performance under 150 ◦C, but PSV-modified membrane is more suitable in high temperature fuel cells.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '3.3. Water uptake and doping level', 'Water uptake amount of nanocomposite membranes contain-ing 5, 10 and 15% of modified nanoparticles at 25 ◦C are shown in Fig. 8. Addition of silica nanoparticles to PPBI membranes increased their water uptakes due to the hygroscopic nature of SiO2 and TiO2nanoparticles. The sulfonic and imidazole groups in the nanopar-ticles increased the water uptake to a greater extent. The amount of water uptake for PPBI/TiO2-PSV, PPBI/SiO2-PSV, PPBI/TiO2-PVI and PPBI/SiO2-PVI are 21.6, 22.7, 20.4 and 21.9%, respectively. The effect of sulfonic acid groups of PSV chains grafted onto the nanoparticle surface on the water uptake is more than imidazole groups in PVI chains due to the higher hygroscopic properties of PSV comparing to PVI chains grafted on to the silica nanopar-ticle surface. The water uptake of PPBI/SiO2-PSV is higher than PPBI/TiO2-PSV which can be due to the further increase of the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles in comparison to TiO2 nanoparticle surface.', 'The PPBI-based membranes were doped with 85% H3PO4 to prepare the acid-doped membranes. Fig. 9 shows the acid-doping levels of the PPBI-based nanocomposite membranes.

As an example, for saturated steam the pressure cor-responding to 120 ◦C is 205 kPa. The time of exposure to saturated steam at 120 ◦C was 30 min that this value for temperature of 140 ◦C was increased to 50 min.', 'Fig. 10 shows the Nyquist plot and equivalent circuit of studied membranes at 25 ◦C and RH 100% for some membranes.', 'After fitting the EIS experimental data on the electrical equiv-alent circuit, the membrane proton conductivity was determined from the intercept of EIS data with real impedance Z′ axis (as the value of Rm element).

Li et al. have used sulfonated organosilica to modify Nafion® membranes and they found that the proton con-ductivities of the modified membranes were still lower than that of the neat Nafion® membrane.', 'The reduction in the proton conductivity was attributed to the silica-induced changes in the tortuous paths and in the dis-tribution of hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains. However, in this work an enhancing effect on the proton conductivity was observed with addition of PSV and PVI grafted nanoparticles to PPBI mem-brane. The sulfonic and imidazole groups of modified nanoparticles also contribute in the acid-doping effect to PPBI polymer so as to enhance the proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles. Moreover, the presence of modified nanoparticles induces proton conductive pathways lead-ing to an increase in the proton conductivities of PPBI/modified nanoparticles membranes [24].', 'The proton conductivities of the acid-doped nanocompos-ite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 12) were further studied at high temperatures under an anhydrous environment. All the PPBI/modified nanoparticle membranes still exhibited higher proton conductivities than the pristine acid-doped PPBI membrane.', '@', '@', 'Generally, two principle mechanisms of vehicle mechanism and Grotthuss mechanism (hopping) describe proton diffusion through the membrane [33]. It is possible that the bounded water par-ticipates by the Grotthuss mechanism, and the free water takes part mostly by vehicle mechanism [34]. Addition of silica-SO3H to the membranes increases the bounded water content in the membranes (Fig. 13). The bounded water facilitates the proton transport ability through the Grotthuss mechanism, originating by generation of a continuous proton conductive pathway. There-fore, the high proton conductivity of PPBI/modified nanoparticles can be attributed to the high bounded water content in the membrane.', 'Since the Grotthuss-type diffusion mechanism without assis-tance of the vehicle mechanism has been proposed for the protonconductionunderanhydrousenvironments[35,36], theprotonconductivityoftheacid-dopedPPBI/modified nanoparticlemembranescouldbesynergisticallyresulted from their modified nanoparticle contents and the acid-doping levels.', 'Consequently, the highest proton conductivity was obtained withtheacid-dopedPPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%membraneathigh humidity and low temperatures and PPBI/SiO2-PVI-15% mem-brane in high temperatures and low humidity, which possesses the moderate modified nanoparticles content and acid-doping level.', 'As it is seen in Fig. 9, either we use PSV-modified or un-modified nanoparticles, the increase in the amount of the nanoparticles leads to a decrease in the acid doping level, but when PVI-modified nanoparticles were used, doping level increased.

Consequently, high proton conductiv-ity can be a result of these changes. It should be mentioned that in temperatures higher than 100 ◦C and in very low relative humidity, water uptake of PSV-modified membranes decreases which leads to low efficiency of the sulfonic groups attached onto the surface of the nanoparticles which in turn results in a decrease in proton conduc-tivity in both membranes, but the increase in proton conductivity resulting from high doping level is significant and also the proton conductivity of PVI-modified nanocomposite membranes increase in high temperatures.', 'It is noteworthy that Nafion® 117 shows relatively low pro-ton conductivities under anhydrous conditions and almost lacks its proton conductivities at high temperatures. Comparing to Nafion®117 membranes, the high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicate that this membrane could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', '3.5.

Introduction of modified and un-modified nanoparticles increases the brittleness of the nanocomposite mem-branes with a decrease in their elongations at break. The effects of modified and unmodified nanoparticles on the elongations at break of the nanocomposite membranes were different. The decrease in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness were widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inorganic reinforcement [37–39].

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25�C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 �C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 �10�4 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 �0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 �C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 �C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by significant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of �4 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers.', '�2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through proton exchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Nafion�as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18].', 'Transport properties and nanostructure of sulfonated polyimide (SPI) membranes have been studied using pulsed field gradient NMR and NMR quadrupolar relaxation rates determinations [19,20], and small angle scattering methods (SAXS and SANS), respectively [21,22].', 'The microstructure of sulfonated polyetherether ketone (sPEEK) has been investigated by SAXS [12]. We recently reported a class of ionomers based on aromatic hydrocarbon copolymers with high proton conductivity and excellent thermal mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states [22e29]. Sulfonated poly-arylenethioethersulfone(SPTES)copolymershavefollowing chemical structures (Fig. 1).', 'SPTES copolymers including SPTES-50, SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80, have equivalent weight (EW) and IEC (mequiv./g) values of 610, 515, 459, 417, and 1.64, 1.94, 2.18, and 2.4, respectively [22]. They exhibited proton conductivity of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm respectively, at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity [22]. Their excellent proton conductivity at high temperatures combined with their high glass transition temperature (w200 �C) and mechanical stability (both in the dry and hydrated states) make them excellent potentials as high temperature PEM materials for fuel cells. SPTES-50 copolymer membrane has successfully been fabricated to membrane electrode assemblies and exhibited polarization curves and durability up to 400 h [29]. Their successful operations at 90e100 �C were limited by boiling point of water (100 �C at 1 atm). Replacing water molecules with heterocycles such as imidazolium where the charge carrier has a very low vapor pressure can result in proton conductivity at higher temperatures. Despite excellent electrochemical properties, excessive water uptake of SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes provide difficulties to be made as membrane electrode assembly [22,27] The proton transport and performance of SPTES copolymers highly depend on the presence of water molecules. In addition to the number of sulfonic groups, their acidity (pKa) ability to dissociate water molecules to proton, water activity coefficient, and number of water molecules associated with each sulfonic group, the supermolecular structure of the hydro-phobic and hydrophilic phases is also defined by polymer chain characteristics such as chain persistent length, and presence of sulfonic group on the backbone or in the side chains. We reported the presence of ionic nanodomains containing water molecules in the SPTES-70 using in-situ x-ray scattering [27]. The morphology and the nanostructure of SPTES-50 were approximated by corre-lated polydisperse spherical aggregates and a larger scale water domain network and were quantified by modeling of the SANS spectra with polydisperse hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [29]. This study reports the nanostructure and morphology of sulfonated polyarylenethioethersulfone (SPTES) copolymer membranes which is directly related to the proton transport through the membrane in terms of their degree of sulfonation and temperature dependency.', '2. Materials and methods', '2.1. Materials', 'Visually observed defect free films of SPTES copolymers were prepared by dissolving the purified copolymer in dimethyl acet-amide (DMAc, Sigma Aldrich) (5e10 wt%) filtering, placing in a flat dish in a vacuum oven with a gradual temperature rise to 100 �C for 24 h and 120 �C for 2 h. The resulting uniform flat films were immersed for 2 h in deionized water and dried under vacuum (24 h, 80 �C) after they were acidified in sulfuric acid (4 M, 24 h) to ensure complete conversion of sulfonic groups to their protonated forms.', '2.2. Characterization', 'SANS experiments were performed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Neutron Center for Research using 30 m NG-7 SANS instrument with a neutron wavelength, l, of 6 Å (Dl/l ¼ 10%) and three sample-to-detector distance of 1.5 m, 10 m (l ¼ 6 Å), and 15 m (l ¼ 8 Å), 0.001 < q < 0.3168 Å�1 at 25, and 55 �C (accuracy of 0.5 �C). Hydrated membranes were placed in demountable 1 mm thick titanium liquid cells filled with D2O after equilibrium in D2O (24 h). Scattered intensities were reduced, corrected for the transmission and background and placed on absolute scale. Then, circularly averaged to produce absolute scale scattering intensity, I(q), as a function of the wave vector, q, where q ¼ (4p/l)sin(q/2) and q is the scattering angle. Calculations were performed using Igor Pro�software [30,31]. USANS experiments covered a q-range of 0.00005 < q (Å�1) < 0.01, corresponding to a real-space length scale of 0.1 microne10 micron.', '3. Results and discussions', '3.1. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 25 �C', 'SPTES copolymers have high proton conductivity at high relative humidities and elevated temperatures; e.g. 65 �C and 85% RH of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers, respectively [27]. The degree of sulfonation increases for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6%, respectively. SPTES-50 copolymer has the lowest the degree of sulfonation and SPTES-80 copolymer has the highest degree of sulfonation in this class of copolymers [22,27]. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers at 25 �C show a scattering behavior of a two phase structure (Fig. 2a). The contribution of sulfonic groups to the scattering is considered to be negligible due to their small volume compared to the polymer and the water phase volume. It was visually observed that membranes do not dissociate when fully hydrated in the examined temperature. It was also determined by weight measurement that the membranes maintain the weight after deswelling. Therefore, the hydrophobic polymeric structure is the supporting network even at high water content and increased temperatures. Fig. 2a presents enhanced scattering intensity data (vertically shifted) for the hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copol-ymer membranes in the order of 20X, 1000X, and 2 �105X for the clarity of data presentation. The absolute scale scattering intensities in the medium q range of 0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1 are almost in the same intensity range for all SPTES copolymers. The high q scattering spectra for all copolymers exhibit a feature which is attributed to the presence of ionic domains containing water molecules. According to the scattering results, the morphology of all hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C can be approximated as correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates with liquid-like ordering (P.Y. ordering) and a power law decay [29]. The scattering data for the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C were compared and quantified using polydisperse (Schulz polydispersity) hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [32e34] and a low q power law decay [29]. The modeling of the SPETS 50 nanostructure and its properties have been reported elsewhere but presented here for clarity and completeness of the SPTES series analysis [29]. Fig. 2b shows the experimental scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 25 �C compared with the theoretical calculations of the model (solid line). The results of the comparison of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes scattering data with the model are summarized in Table 1. According to this modeling the domain radius increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 13.45,14.9,15.4, and 16.9 Å for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes. The hard sphere packing density increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 19.8%, 23%, 25%, 29% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. This could indicate that ionic domains are capable of holding more water molecules with the presence of more sulfonic groups on the polymer backbone (increasing the degree of sulfonation). The high-q scattering spectra exhibits onset of a peak formation when the degree of sulfonation was increased to 71.6% for SPTES-80 copolymer. Pres-ence of scattering maxima can be due to the scattering from an ordered structure (periodicity) or the oscillations resulted from the structural factor effects or the excluded volume effect arising from short range liquid-like ordering. The onset of peak formation is attributed to the excluded volume effects related to the liquid-like ordering [33e35]. The low-q power law decay of nearly �3 was observed for all SPTES copolymers in the range of 1 �10�4 < q (1/ Å) < 3 �10�3. The power law decay of �3 is attributed to the presence of interacting three-dimensional fractal morphology. In addition, a Guinier plateau [35] was present for the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer at the very low q (q (1/Å) < 9 �10�5). This is in addition to the nearly identical scattering intensity in the inter-mediate q-range (0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1). It can be concluded that the change in the degree of sulfonation had little or no effect on the intermediate and low angle scattering wave vector. The low-q power law decay was nearly �3 �0.1 for all SPTES copolymers. The presence of sharp interface between hydrophobic and hydro-philic domains was deduced from the power law decay of �4 at large angle wave vectors for all hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes. All scattering data presented in Fig. 2a shows a power slope of �3.85 to �4.15 which is approximated as w �4. The presence of Porod behavior (decay of �4) has been attributed to the two immiscible phase with a sharp boundary [35e37]. This shows that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are separated with a distinct interface containing sulfonic groups.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Presence of a plateau in the scattering spectra is characteristics of isolated scatterers [35]. The radius of gyration (Rg) of the isolated scatterers can be approximated by IðqÞ ¼ I0expðð�q2R2gÞ=3Þ, where I0 is the extrapolated zero scattering intensity (Guinier approxi-mation) [35]. Presence of the Guinier plateau in the q range of 4.3 �10�5 < q (1/Å) < 8.2 �10�5 for SPTES-80 copolymer suggests segregation of the isolated large scale hydrophilic water pockets when the degree of sulfonation increased to 71.6%. Radius of gyration of the isolated larger scale water pockets in fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was 1.3 �0.18 micron which was calculated from this approximation (Fig. 2c).', '@', '@', '3.2. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 55 �C', 'Based on the physical observations, water saturated membranes at 55 �C were swollen films without visual dissociation. Fig. 3 exhibits the scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. The inter-mediate scattering intensity decreased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes start to form scattering maxima at high q range when the degree of sulfonation increased. This indicated the increase in the excluded volume due to the increase in the volume of the scatterers at higher degree of sulfonation and increased temperature (55 �C). The presence of scattering maxima is more significant for SPTES-70 copolymer and SPTES-80 copolymer with 63.3 and 71.6% degree of sulfonation. The large angle scattering feature shows scattering maxima at qmax of 0.103 and 0.1108 1/Å for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers which correspond to spatial characteristics lengths (l ¼ 2p/qmax) of 60.97 and 56.7 Å due to concentration fluctuations of hydrated domains (hard spheres). The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes changed significantlywith increasing degree of sulfonation. This indicates a substantial change in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology with increasing degree of sulfonation at 55 �C which is more pronounced for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers (degree of sulfonation 63.3 and 71.6%, respectively). Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are segregated distinctly by the sulfonic groups at the interface which is repre-sented by the Porod behavior, asymptotic behavior of w �4 for all SPTES copolymers [35e37]. The morphology of these membranes is complex and controlled by interfacial phenomena. The number of sulfonic groups per repeat unit volume and their acidity com-plemented with the chain persistent length and chain mobility are governing factors in the formed morphology. This study approxi-mates the morphology of the fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55 �C are approximated as spherical nanodomains containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering similar to their morphology at 25 �C. It is also proposed that this morphology changedtofractalmorphologywithincreasing temperature (increasing the intermediate scattering decay). The domain radius and the sphere packing density were increased from 26.4 Å and 28% for SPTES-50 copolymer to 32 Å and 33% for SPTES-60copolymerwhiletheintermediatescatteringintensity decreased. The domain radius and packing density of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane increased from 13.45 Å and 19.8% to 26.4 Å and 28% when the temperature increased from 25 �C to 55 �C with this approximation. The same increasing trend of 14.9 Åe32 Å for the average domain radius and 23%e33% of the sphere packing density was observed. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane compared to the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane is attributed to the disruption of the large scale morphology. The low q power law decay of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane was close to the decay of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane.', 'The increase in the degree of sulfonation of SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymers from 54.9, to 63.3 and 71.6% resulted in a shift in the position of the high q scattering maxima of the hydrated membranes toward the large angle scattering regime. This peak formation is more prominent for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copoly-mers with higher sulfonation degree. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering intensity in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers is attributed to the loss of the large scale water network, intermediate fractal morphology within the polymer and onset of a morphology change to a two large scale phase morphology. The closed domain morphology of polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with fractal network were present for fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55�C (Figs. 3 and 4a). However, substantialchangesinthemorphologyoffullyhydrated membranes occurred when the degree of sulfonation is increased to 63.3 and 71.6% for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers at higher temperature of 55 �C. Combination of high temperature, high density of sulfonic groups, and significant amount of water mole-cules within the polymer backbone could have resulted in the coalescence of the small spherical ionic domains and fractal water network into a larger scale bicontinuous network of intermeshed hydrophobic and hydrophilic morphology for fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane at 55 �C. The bicontinuous model origi-nally proposed for micro-emulsion of two immiscible phases of water and oil with comparable amount based on Landau theory [38,39]. This model describes two irregular shapes with distinct boundary and has been used for intermesh of hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure when the particle shape is not well-defined [40,41]. This model proposes I(q) ¼ (a2þc1q þ c2q2)�1 for a2 > 0, c1 < 0, and c2 > 0, a single broad scattering maxima, and power law decay of �4 at large scattering angles. Two characteristics lengths of d and x are deduced from this analysis having a2, c1, and c2[39,40], d is the domain periodicity or interdomain distance and x is the correlation length which has been attributed to the dispersion of d. According to this theory, c1 is negative due to the surfactant. The absolute values of c1 and the ratio of x/d should increase with increasing surfactant. The specific internal surface area can be derived from the ratio of S/V ¼ 44(1�4)/x [38,39].', 'The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane has a low-q upturn, a lower intermediate scattering intensity compared to the hydrated SPTES-60 and SPTES-50 copolymers, and a large angle maxima followed by a power law decay of �4. This indicates the onset of the coalescence of the ionic aggregates, disruption of the fractal water network, and the formation of the two irregular large scale bicontinuous phase morphology. The high q range (q > 0.037 1/Å) of the scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 55 �C was compared with the T.S. bicontinuous model (Fig. 4b). This simulation resulted in a periodicity, d, of 59.9 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima position, 60.97 Å. According to this simulation, the correlation length (x) is 31.14 Å. The medium-q range scattering still exhibits the larger scale morphology which is not completely converted to the bi-continuous phase morphology. However, they are partially collapsed characterized by a lower scattering intensity in the intermediate q range. The high q maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 is approximated as bicontinuous morphology. The low and medium q (q < 0.037 1/Å) scattering spectra of the SPTES 70 is due to the presence of fractal network of waters which have not coalesce yet.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The scattering spectra of the SPTES-80 copolymer are consistent with a bicontinuous two phase structure of irregular shapes with sulfonic groups as interfacial ionic region. The scattering experi-mental data of the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was compared with this model (q > 0.015 1/Å), (Fig. 4c and Table 2). The periodicity of the water domains (or hydrophobic domains), d, predicted by this model is w54 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima (qmax), 56.7 Å. This value is the distance between water domains. The correlation length (x) obtained from this model is 37.86 Å which is a measure of dispersion.', 'The distance between the water phases, periodicity, was decreased from 59.9 Å to 54 Å with increasing degree of sulfona-tion. The correlation length, x, was increased from 31.14 Å to 37.86 Å when the degree of sulfonation increased. Increasing the interfacial area results in an increase in the x/d ratio. The presence of the upturn in the low range of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 at 55 �C (Fig. 4b and c) is attributed to the fractal morphology of the large scale features.', '3.3. Discussions', 'Scattering data of series of SPTES membranes were obtained in the full hydration state with increasing the sulfonation degree in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. Complete study was performed to provide understanding membranes morphology with increasing the temperature of the hydrated membranes from 25 �C to 55 �C. Proposed model assumes spherical nanodomains containing water molecules forming from clustering of the sulfonation groups. This assumption was performed based on previously reported study which showed spherical nanodomains in the dry SPTES 50 membrane under HR-TEM [29]. The scattering spectra of the membranes with high degree of sulfonation (SPTES 70, and 80) changed significantly when the temperature increased to 55 �C. The morphology is approximated as bi-continuous system where the hydrocarbon is the main support network containing water. This model has been recently proposed by Wnek et al. [40], Gebel [8], and Kreuer [12], Wnek also provided visualization of the hydro-phobic cluster using SYBYL version 6.7 (Tripos) and HINT (Hydro-pathicINTeractions)computationalmodelingsoftware[40]. Despite the support of the transport studies of this model [42], there is no direct visualization method for this proposed approxi-mation. The T. S. model is also supported by high proton conduc-tivity of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 membranes at 55 �C where a larger number of hydronium ions in a larger domain can facilitate proton transport. A summary of the structural evolution of the SPTES membranes as a function of temperature and degree of sulfonation is illustrated in Table 3. This study attempted to study a full range of SPTES membrane nanostructure for the first time and provide an understanding of large membrane water uptakes, and their morphology and their relation with high conductivity of the membranes using both liquid like ordering of polydisperse nano-spheres and bi-continuous T.S. model approximation.', '@', '@', 'Table 3 Summary of membrane structural changes (SPTES 50, 60, 70, and 80 at 25 �C, and SPTES 50 and 60 at 55 �C) as a function of degree of sulfonation and temperature by polydisperse hard sphere model with liquid-like ordering ordering). T.S. bi-continuous model was approximated for higher sulfonation degree copolymers, SPTES 70 and 80, at 55 �C.', '@', '4. Conclusions', 'A series of SPTES copolymers with high proton conductivity of 100e215 mS/cm at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity as potential fuel cells membranes were studied. SANS studies of fully hydrated membranes showed that the nanostructure of the fully hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C in agreement with ionic aggregates containing water molecules with a large scale morphology network of water pockets morphology. This model predicted that the increase in the degree of sulfonation resulted in an increase in the radius of ionic domains and an increase in the volume packing density of water in the aggregates. It was assumed that the same morphology of polydisperse correlated spherical ionic domains were present in the SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymers when the temperature increased to 55 �C. Increase in the degree of sulfonation for fully hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer at 55 �C led to a substantial reorganization of the membrane morphology which was described by a bi-continuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic network.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to thank the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Nano-structured andBiological Materials Branch forfunding this research.

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25�C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 �C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 �10�4 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 �0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 �C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 �C).

All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through proton exchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Nafion�as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18].', 'Transport properties and nanostructure of sulfonated polyimide (SPI) membranes have been studied using pulsed field gradient NMR and NMR quadrupolar relaxation rates determinations [19,20], and small angle scattering methods (SAXS and SANS), respectively [21,22].']

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25�C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 �C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 �10�4 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 �0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 �C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 �C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by significant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of �4 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers.', '�2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through proton exchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Nafion�as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18].', 'Transport properties and nanostructure of sulfonated polyimide (SPI) membranes have been studied using pulsed field gradient NMR and NMR quadrupolar relaxation rates determinations [19,20], and small angle scattering methods (SAXS and SANS), respectively [21,22].', 'The microstructure of sulfonated polyetherether ketone (sPEEK) has been investigated by SAXS [12]. We recently reported a class of ionomers based on aromatic hydrocarbon copolymers with high proton conductivity and excellent thermal mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states [22e29]. Sulfonated poly-arylenethioethersulfone(SPTES)copolymershavefollowing chemical structures (Fig. 1).', 'SPTES copolymers including SPTES-50, SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80, have equivalent weight (EW) and IEC (mequiv./g) values of 610, 515, 459, 417, and 1.64, 1.94, 2.18, and 2.4, respectively [22]. They exhibited proton conductivity of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm respectively, at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity [22]. Their excellent proton conductivity at high temperatures combined with their high glass transition temperature (w200 �C) and mechanical stability (both in the dry and hydrated states) make them excellent potentials as high temperature PEM materials for fuel cells. SPTES-50 copolymer membrane has successfully been fabricated to membrane electrode assemblies and exhibited polarization curves and durability up to 400 h [29]. Their successful operations at 90e100 �C were limited by boiling point of water (100 �C at 1 atm). Replacing water molecules with heterocycles such as imidazolium where the charge carrier has a very low vapor pressure can result in proton conductivity at higher temperatures. Despite excellent electrochemical properties, excessive water uptake of SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes provide difficulties to be made as membrane electrode assembly [22,27] The proton transport and performance of SPTES copolymers highly depend on the presence of water molecules. In addition to the number of sulfonic groups, their acidity (pKa) ability to dissociate water molecules to proton, water activity coefficient, and number of water molecules associated with each sulfonic group, the supermolecular structure of the hydro-phobic and hydrophilic phases is also defined by polymer chain characteristics such as chain persistent length, and presence of sulfonic group on the backbone or in the side chains. We reported the presence of ionic nanodomains containing water molecules in the SPTES-70 using in-situ x-ray scattering [27]. The morphology and the nanostructure of SPTES-50 were approximated by corre-lated polydisperse spherical aggregates and a larger scale water domain network and were quantified by modeling of the SANS spectra with polydisperse hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [29]. This study reports the nanostructure and morphology of sulfonated polyarylenethioethersulfone (SPTES) copolymer membranes which is directly related to the proton transport through the membrane in terms of their degree of sulfonation and temperature dependency.', '2. Materials and methods', '2.1. Materials', 'Visually observed defect free films of SPTES copolymers were prepared by dissolving the purified copolymer in dimethyl acet-amide (DMAc, Sigma Aldrich) (5e10 wt%) filtering, placing in a flat dish in a vacuum oven with a gradual temperature rise to 100 �C for 24 h and 120 �C for 2 h. The resulting uniform flat films were immersed for 2 h in deionized water and dried under vacuum (24 h, 80 �C) after they were acidified in sulfuric acid (4 M, 24 h) to ensure complete conversion of sulfonic groups to their protonated forms.', '2.2. Characterization', 'SANS experiments were performed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Neutron Center for Research using 30 m NG-7 SANS instrument with a neutron wavelength, l, of 6 Å (Dl/l ¼ 10%) and three sample-to-detector distance of 1.5 m, 10 m (l ¼ 6 Å), and 15 m (l ¼ 8 Å), 0.001 < q < 0.3168 Å�1 at 25, and 55 �C (accuracy of 0.5 �C). Hydrated membranes were placed in demountable 1 mm thick titanium liquid cells filled with D2O after equilibrium in D2O (24 h). Scattered intensities were reduced, corrected for the transmission and background and placed on absolute scale. Then, circularly averaged to produce absolute scale scattering intensity, I(q), as a function of the wave vector, q, where q ¼ (4p/l)sin(q/2) and q is the scattering angle. Calculations were performed using Igor Pro�software [30,31]. USANS experiments covered a q-range of 0.00005 < q (Å�1) < 0.01, corresponding to a real-space length scale of 0.1 microne10 micron.', '3. Results and discussions', '3.1. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 25 �C', 'SPTES copolymers have high proton conductivity at high relative humidities and elevated temperatures; e.g. 65 �C and 85% RH of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers, respectively [27]. The degree of sulfonation increases for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6%, respectively. SPTES-50 copolymer has the lowest the degree of sulfonation and SPTES-80 copolymer has the highest degree of sulfonation in this class of copolymers [22,27]. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers at 25 �C show a scattering behavior of a two phase structure (Fig. 2a). The contribution of sulfonic groups to the scattering is considered to be negligible due to their small volume compared to the polymer and the water phase volume. It was visually observed that membranes do not dissociate when fully hydrated in the examined temperature. It was also determined by weight measurement that the membranes maintain the weight after deswelling. Therefore, the hydrophobic polymeric structure is the supporting network even at high water content and increased temperatures. Fig. 2a presents enhanced scattering intensity data (vertically shifted) for the hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copol-ymer membranes in the order of 20X, 1000X, and 2 �105X for the clarity of data presentation. The absolute scale scattering intensities in the medium q range of 0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1 are almost in the same intensity range for all SPTES copolymers. The high q scattering spectra for all copolymers exhibit a feature which is attributed to the presence of ionic domains containing water molecules. According to the scattering results, the morphology of all hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C can be approximated as correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates with liquid-like ordering (P.Y. ordering) and a power law decay [29]. The scattering data for the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C were compared and quantified using polydisperse (Schulz polydispersity) hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [32e34] and a low q power law decay [29]. The modeling of the SPETS 50 nanostructure and its properties have been reported elsewhere but presented here for clarity and completeness of the SPTES series analysis [29]. Fig. 2b shows the experimental scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 25 �C compared with the theoretical calculations of the model (solid line). The results of the comparison of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes scattering data with the model are summarized in Table 1. According to this modeling the domain radius increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 13.45,14.9,15.4, and 16.9 Å for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes. The hard sphere packing density increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 19.8%, 23%, 25%, 29% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. This could indicate that ionic domains are capable of holding more water molecules with the presence of more sulfonic groups on the polymer backbone (increasing the degree of sulfonation). The high-q scattering spectra exhibits onset of a peak formation when the degree of sulfonation was increased to 71.6% for SPTES-80 copolymer. Pres-ence of scattering maxima can be due to the scattering from an ordered structure (periodicity) or the oscillations resulted from the structural factor effects or the excluded volume effect arising from short range liquid-like ordering. The onset of peak formation is attributed to the excluded volume effects related to the liquid-like ordering [33e35]. The low-q power law decay of nearly �3 was observed for all SPTES copolymers in the range of 1 �10�4 < q (1/ Å) < 3 �10�3. The power law decay of �3 is attributed to the presence of interacting three-dimensional fractal morphology. In addition, a Guinier plateau [35] was present for the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer at the very low q (q (1/Å) < 9 �10�5). This is in addition to the nearly identical scattering intensity in the inter-mediate q-range (0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1). It can be concluded that the change in the degree of sulfonation had little or no effect on the intermediate and low angle scattering wave vector. The low-q power law decay was nearly �3 �0.1 for all SPTES copolymers. The presence of sharp interface between hydrophobic and hydro-philic domains was deduced from the power law decay of �4 at large angle wave vectors for all hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes. All scattering data presented in Fig. 2a shows a power slope of �3.85 to �4.15 which is approximated as w �4. The presence of Porod behavior (decay of �4) has been attributed to the two immiscible phase with a sharp boundary [35e37]. This shows that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are separated with a distinct interface containing sulfonic groups.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Presence of a plateau in the scattering spectra is characteristics of isolated scatterers [35]. The radius of gyration (Rg) of the isolated scatterers can be approximated by IðqÞ ¼ I0expðð�q2R2gÞ=3Þ, where I0 is the extrapolated zero scattering intensity (Guinier approxi-mation) [35]. Presence of the Guinier plateau in the q range of 4.3 �10�5 < q (1/Å) < 8.2 �10�5 for SPTES-80 copolymer suggests segregation of the isolated large scale hydrophilic water pockets when the degree of sulfonation increased to 71.6%. Radius of gyration of the isolated larger scale water pockets in fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was 1.3 �0.18 micron which was calculated from this approximation (Fig. 2c).', '@', '@', '3.2. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 55 �C', 'Based on the physical observations, water saturated membranes at 55 �C were swollen films without visual dissociation. Fig. 3 exhibits the scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. The inter-mediate scattering intensity decreased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes start to form scattering maxima at high q range when the degree of sulfonation increased. This indicated the increase in the excluded volume due to the increase in the volume of the scatterers at higher degree of sulfonation and increased temperature (55 �C). The presence of scattering maxima is more significant for SPTES-70 copolymer and SPTES-80 copolymer with 63.3 and 71.6% degree of sulfonation. The large angle scattering feature shows scattering maxima at qmax of 0.103 and 0.1108 1/Å for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers which correspond to spatial characteristics lengths (l ¼ 2p/qmax) of 60.97 and 56.7 Å due to concentration fluctuations of hydrated domains (hard spheres). The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes changed significantlywith increasing degree of sulfonation. This indicates a substantial change in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology with increasing degree of sulfonation at 55 �C which is more pronounced for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers (degree of sulfonation 63.3 and 71.6%, respectively). Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are segregated distinctly by the sulfonic groups at the interface which is repre-sented by the Porod behavior, asymptotic behavior of w �4 for all SPTES copolymers [35e37]. The morphology of these membranes is complex and controlled by interfacial phenomena. The number of sulfonic groups per repeat unit volume and their acidity com-plemented with the chain persistent length and chain mobility are governing factors in the formed morphology. This study approxi-mates the morphology of the fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55 �C are approximated as spherical nanodomains containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering similar to their morphology at 25 �C. It is also proposed that this morphology changedtofractalmorphologywithincreasing temperature (increasing the intermediate scattering decay). The domain radius and the sphere packing density were increased from 26.4 Å and 28% for SPTES-50 copolymer to 32 Å and 33% for SPTES-60copolymerwhiletheintermediatescatteringintensity decreased. The domain radius and packing density of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane increased from 13.45 Å and 19.8% to 26.4 Å and 28% when the temperature increased from 25 �C to 55 �C with this approximation. The same increasing trend of 14.9 Åe32 Å for the average domain radius and 23%e33% of the sphere packing density was observed. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane compared to the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane is attributed to the disruption of the large scale morphology. The low q power law decay of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane was close to the decay of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane.', 'The increase in the degree of sulfonation of SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymers from 54.9, to 63.3 and 71.6% resulted in a shift in the position of the high q scattering maxima of the hydrated membranes toward the large angle scattering regime. This peak formation is more prominent for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copoly-mers with higher sulfonation degree. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering intensity in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers is attributed to the loss of the large scale water network, intermediate fractal morphology within the polymer and onset of a morphology change to a two large scale phase morphology. The closed domain morphology of polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with fractal network were present for fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55�C (Figs. 3 and 4a). However, substantialchangesinthemorphologyoffullyhydrated membranes occurred when the degree of sulfonation is increased to 63.3 and 71.6% for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers at higher temperature of 55 �C. Combination of high temperature, high density of sulfonic groups, and significant amount of water mole-cules within the polymer backbone could have resulted in the coalescence of the small spherical ionic domains and fractal water network into a larger scale bicontinuous network of intermeshed hydrophobic and hydrophilic morphology for fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane at 55 �C. The bicontinuous model origi-nally proposed for micro-emulsion of two immiscible phases of water and oil with comparable amount based on Landau theory [38,39]. This model describes two irregular shapes with distinct boundary and has been used for intermesh of hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure when the particle shape is not well-defined [40,41]. This model proposes I(q) ¼ (a2þc1q þ c2q2)�1 for a2 > 0, c1 < 0, and c2 > 0, a single broad scattering maxima, and power law decay of �4 at large scattering angles. Two characteristics lengths of d and x are deduced from this analysis having a2, c1, and c2[39,40], d is the domain periodicity or interdomain distance and x is the correlation length which has been attributed to the dispersion of d. According to this theory, c1 is negative due to the surfactant. The absolute values of c1 and the ratio of x/d should increase with increasing surfactant. The specific internal surface area can be derived from the ratio of S/V ¼ 44(1�4)/x [38,39].', 'The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane has a low-q upturn, a lower intermediate scattering intensity compared to the hydrated SPTES-60 and SPTES-50 copolymers, and a large angle maxima followed by a power law decay of �4. This indicates the onset of the coalescence of the ionic aggregates, disruption of the fractal water network, and the formation of the two irregular large scale bicontinuous phase morphology. The high q range (q > 0.037 1/Å) of the scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 55 �C was compared with the T.S. bicontinuous model (Fig. 4b). This simulation resulted in a periodicity, d, of 59.9 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima position, 60.97 Å. According to this simulation, the correlation length (x) is 31.14 Å. The medium-q range scattering still exhibits the larger scale morphology which is not completely converted to the bi-continuous phase morphology. However, they are partially collapsed characterized by a lower scattering intensity in the intermediate q range. The high q maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 is approximated as bicontinuous morphology. The low and medium q (q < 0.037 1/Å) scattering spectra of the SPTES 70 is due to the presence of fractal network of waters which have not coalesce yet.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The scattering spectra of the SPTES-80 copolymer are consistent with a bicontinuous two phase structure of irregular shapes with sulfonic groups as interfacial ionic region. The scattering experi-mental data of the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was compared with this model (q > 0.015 1/Å), (Fig. 4c and Table 2). The periodicity of the water domains (or hydrophobic domains), d, predicted by this model is w54 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima (qmax), 56.7 Å. This value is the distance between water domains. The correlation length (x) obtained from this model is 37.86 Å which is a measure of dispersion.', 'The distance between the water phases, periodicity, was decreased from 59.9 Å to 54 Å with increasing degree of sulfona-tion. The correlation length, x, was increased from 31.14 Å to 37.86 Å when the degree of sulfonation increased. Increasing the interfacial area results in an increase in the x/d ratio. The presence of the upturn in the low range of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 at 55 �C (Fig. 4b and c) is attributed to the fractal morphology of the large scale features.', '3.3. Discussions', 'Scattering data of series of SPTES membranes were obtained in the full hydration state with increasing the sulfonation degree in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. Complete study was performed to provide understanding membranes morphology with increasing the temperature of the hydrated membranes from 25 �C to 55 �C. Proposed model assumes spherical nanodomains containing water molecules forming from clustering of the sulfonation groups. This assumption was performed based on previously reported study which showed spherical nanodomains in the dry SPTES 50 membrane under HR-TEM [29]. The scattering spectra of the membranes with high degree of sulfonation (SPTES 70, and 80) changed significantly when the temperature increased to 55 �C. The morphology is approximated as bi-continuous system where the hydrocarbon is the main support network containing water. This model has been recently proposed by Wnek et al. [40], Gebel [8], and Kreuer [12], Wnek also provided visualization of the hydro-phobic cluster using SYBYL version 6.7 (Tripos) and HINT (Hydro-pathicINTeractions)computationalmodelingsoftware[40]. Despite the support of the transport studies of this model [42], there is no direct visualization method for this proposed approxi-mation. The T. S. model is also supported by high proton conduc-tivity of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 membranes at 55 �C where a larger number of hydronium ions in a larger domain can facilitate proton transport. A summary of the structural evolution of the SPTES membranes as a function of temperature and degree of sulfonation is illustrated in Table 3. This study attempted to study a full range of SPTES membrane nanostructure for the first time and provide an understanding of large membrane water uptakes, and their morphology and their relation with high conductivity of the membranes using both liquid like ordering of polydisperse nano-spheres and bi-continuous T.S. model approximation.', '@', '@', 'Table 3 Summary of membrane structural changes (SPTES 50, 60, 70, and 80 at 25 �C, and SPTES 50 and 60 at 55 �C) as a function of degree of sulfonation and temperature by polydisperse hard sphere model with liquid-like ordering ordering).

This model predicted that the increase in the degree of sulfonation resulted in an increase in the radius of ionic domains and an increase in the volume packing density of water in the aggregates. It was assumed that the same morphology of polydisperse correlated spherical ionic domains were present in the SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymers when the temperature increased to 55 �C. Increase in the degree of sulfonation for fully hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer at 55 �C led to a substantial reorganization of the membrane morphology which was described by a bi-continuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic network.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to thank the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Nano-structured andBiological Materials Branch forfunding this research.

Box 5166616471, Tabriz, Iran', 'a r t i c l ei n f o', 'a b s t r a c t', 'Article history: Received 4 July 2010 Received in revised form 21 October 2010 Accepted 23 October 2010 Available online 4 November 2010', 'Keywords: Polybenzimidazole Proton exchange membrane Modified nanoparticles Sulfonated vinylbenzene Vinylimidazole', 'Poly[2,2′-(m-pyrazolidene)-5,5′-bibenzimidazole](PPBI)wassynthesizedfrompyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylic acid and 3,3′,4,4′-tetraaminobiphenyle (TAB) through polycondensation reaction in polyphosphoric acid (PPA) as reaction solvent. And polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared through radical polymerization of 1-vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface-vinylated nanoparticles. The polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were utilized as a functional additive to prepare PPBI/polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. Imida-zole and sulfonated vinylbenzene groups on the surface of modified nanoparticles forming linkages with PPBI chains, improved the compatibility between PPBI and nanoparticles, and enhanced the mechanical strength of the prepared nanocomposite membranes. The prepared nanocomposite membranes showed higher water uptake and acid doping levels comparing to PPBI. Also, after acid doping with phosphoric acid, nanocomposite membranes exhibited enhanced proton conductivity in comparison to the pristine PPBI and PPBI/un-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. The enhancement in proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes resulted from modified SiO2 nanoparticles showed higher conductivity than modified TiO2 nanoparticles. The above results indicated that the PPBI/modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for medium temperature fuel cells.', '© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang- ers [1–3]. Sulfonated polysulfone (PSF) [4], polyetheretherketone (PEEK) [5,6] and polybenzimidazoles (PBIs) [7–11] are among poly-mers which can be used as alternatives for Nafion in PEFCs.', 'Amongpolybenzimidazolederivatives,poly[2,2-5,5(m-phenylene)-bibenzimidazole](PBI),whichisalsocalled commercial polybenzimidazole have been used as a mem-brane material in PEMFCs. Having high chemical as well as thermal resistance and proton conductivity, polybenzimidazoles are great options to be used in the fuel cells with function at elevated temperatures above 100 ◦C [12].', 'PBIs should have enough proton conductivity so that it could be used as proton exchange membranes in the fuel cells. To achieve this purpose, they are usually doped with a sufficient acid like H3PO4 to an appropriate doping level [13]. Nanocomposite membranes are a new group of membranes which contain nanopar-ticles such as SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 and other compounds [14–21]. The introduction of nanoparticles into the membranes results in a considerable improvement in their features like mechani-cal properties, methanol permeability, but in some cases leads to a decrease in proton conductivity [22–24]. In order to over-come this problem, surface functionalized nanoparticles, which means various compounds with polar groups grafted chemically to the surface of the nanoparticles [25–28], were used. As men-tioned before, the numerous research works were done concerning grafting various compounds on the SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles which used for different purposes. However, in this work, we have used monomer bearing functional groups like imidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene which can improve the properties of pro-ton conductive membranes. These monomers are polymerized on the surface of the nanoparticles and as a consequence, they can more affect the properties of the membranes than while one functional group is grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. In addition, the polymerization of the selected monomers such as vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface of nanoparticle could cause more compatibility between nanopar-ticles and polymer matrix which finally improve the mechanical properties. In this work, nanocomposite membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles and newly synthesized polybenzimidazole was depicted poly[2,2-5,5-(m-pyrazolidene)-bibenzimidazole] (PPBI). Modification of the mentioned nanoparticles was performed by radical polymerization of some vinyl monomers such as sulfonated styrene and vinylim-idazole on the surface of the nanoparticles to which vinylic group was bounded covalently. Also, the effect of surface modification on the properties of the nanocomposite membranes such as pro-ton conductivity, mechanical properties and water uptake were studied.', '@', '@', '2.

The absence of absorbent peak related to amine group proton (N–H) in the area of 4.0–5.0 ppm and an absorbent related to amide group in the area of 10.3–10.6 ppm show the complete closure of imidazole rings during the polycondensation reaction.', 'In FT-IR characteristics of PPBI, the presence of absorbent bands in 800 cm−1 is related to the vibration of C–H bond of imida-zole, a band in about 1300 cm−1 is related to the vibration of C–N bond of imidazole, the absorbent band in 1450 cm−1 is related to C N and C C vibrations and bands in the area of 3400 cm−1 and 3140 cm−1 are related to N–H vibrations.

The FT-IR spectrum of the obtained powder did not show any absorbent bands related to PVI and PSV chains. The absorbent bands, which existed in the spectrum of mod-ified nanoparticles, were not observed in this spectrum.

Thermal analysis', 'Thermogravimetric analysis diagrams of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 5. Weight loss in 85 ◦C can be related to the release of physically absorbed water. In un-modified nanoparticles, the minor weight loss in elevated temperatures can be attributed to the loss of hydroxyl groups of the particle surface attached by covalent bonds. Weight loss in modified nanoparticles could be a result of thermal degradation of the polymeric chains grafted to the surface of the nanoparti-cles. Also, the weight loss in 230–300 ◦C was due to the thermal decomposition of the sulfonate groups in the grafted PSV chains [30].', 'Thermograms of PVI modified nanocomposite with 5, 10 and 15% of TiO2 are shown in Fig. 6. As it is observed, the thermal prop-erties of the nanocomposites prepared with various amounts of TiO2 are almost similar.

They were heated to temperatures about 1000 ◦C for 30 min and the obtained nanoparti-cles were weighed immediately. The difference between the weight of un-modified nanoparticles before and after heating shows the amount of lost water which was either physically absorbed or pro-duced from the condensation reaction of the hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticle surface. Also from the difference between the weight of modified nanoparticles before and after heating and consider- ing the weight of lost water, the percentage of the grafted polymer onto the nanoparticle surface was obtained. The obtained results and theoretical amounts are shown in Table 1. The amounts of the obtained results in all cases are more than theoretical values.

Water uptake and doping level', 'Water uptake amount of nanocomposite membranes contain-ing 5, 10 and 15% of modified nanoparticles at 25 ◦C are shown in Fig. 8. Addition of silica nanoparticles to PPBI membranes increased their water uptakes due to the hygroscopic nature of SiO2 and TiO2nanoparticles. The sulfonic and imidazole groups in the nanopar-ticles increased the water uptake to a greater extent. The amount of water uptake for PPBI/TiO2-PSV, PPBI/SiO2-PSV, PPBI/TiO2-PVI and PPBI/SiO2-PVI are 21.6, 22.7, 20.4 and 21.9%, respectively. The effect of sulfonic acid groups of PSV chains grafted onto the nanoparticle surface on the water uptake is more than imidazole groups in PVI chains due to the higher hygroscopic properties of PSV comparing to PVI chains grafted on to the silica nanopar-ticle surface. The water uptake of PPBI/SiO2-PSV is higher than PPBI/TiO2-PSV which can be due to the further increase of the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles in comparison to TiO2 nanoparticle surface.', 'The PPBI-based membranes were doped with 85% H3PO4 to prepare the acid-doped membranes. Fig. 9 shows the acid-doping levels of the PPBI-based nanocomposite membranes.

As an example, for saturated steam the pressure cor-responding to 120 ◦C is 205 kPa. The time of exposure to saturated steam at 120 ◦C was 30 min that this value for temperature of 140 ◦C was increased to 50 min.', 'Fig. 10 shows the Nyquist plot and equivalent circuit of studied membranes at 25 ◦C and RH 100% for some membranes.', 'After fitting the EIS experimental data on the electrical equiv-alent circuit, the membrane proton conductivity was determined from the intercept of EIS data with real impedance Z′ axis (as the value of Rm element).

Similar trends were also reported to other nanocomposite membranes like Nafion®/silica membranes and PBI/silica membranes [31].', '@', '@', 'On the other hand, comparing the pristine PPBI and Nafion®117 membranes, the relatively high proton conductivities of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles are noteworthy [32]. Li et al. have used sulfonated organosilica to modify Nafion® membranes and they found that the proton con-ductivities of the modified membranes were still lower than that of the neat Nafion® membrane.', 'The reduction in the proton conductivity was attributed to the silica-induced changes in the tortuous paths and in the dis-tribution of hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains. However, in this work an enhancing effect on the proton conductivity was observed with addition of PSV and PVI grafted nanoparticles to PPBI mem-brane. The sulfonic and imidazole groups of modified nanoparticles also contribute in the acid-doping effect to PPBI polymer so as to enhance the proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles. Moreover, the presence of modified nanoparticles induces proton conductive pathways lead-ing to an increase in the proton conductivities of PPBI/modified nanoparticles membranes [24].', 'The proton conductivities of the acid-doped nanocompos-ite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 12) were further studied at high temperatures under an anhydrous environment. All the PPBI/modified nanoparticle membranes still exhibited higher proton conductivities than the pristine acid-doped PPBI membrane.', '@', '@', 'Generally, two principle mechanisms of vehicle mechanism and Grotthuss mechanism (hopping) describe proton diffusion through the membrane [33]. It is possible that the bounded water par-ticipates by the Grotthuss mechanism, and the free water takes part mostly by vehicle mechanism [34]. Addition of silica-SO3H to the membranes increases the bounded water content in the membranes (Fig. 13). The bounded water facilitates the proton transport ability through the Grotthuss mechanism, originating by generation of a continuous proton conductive pathway. There-fore, the high proton conductivity of PPBI/modified nanoparticles can be attributed to the high bounded water content in the membrane.', 'Since the Grotthuss-type diffusion mechanism without assis-tance of the vehicle mechanism has been proposed for the protonconductionunderanhydrousenvironments[35,36], theprotonconductivityoftheacid-dopedPPBI/modified nanoparticlemembranescouldbesynergisticallyresulted from their modified nanoparticle contents and the acid-doping levels.', 'Consequently, the highest proton conductivity was obtained withtheacid-dopedPPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%membraneathigh humidity and low temperatures and PPBI/SiO2-PVI-15% mem-brane in high temperatures and low humidity, which possesses the moderate modified nanoparticles content and acid-doping level.', 'As it is seen in Fig. 9, either we use PSV-modified or un-modified nanoparticles, the increase in the amount of the nanoparticles leads to a decrease in the acid doping level, but when PVI-modified nanoparticles were used, doping level increased.

Proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PSV-modified nanoparticles shows significant increase in comparison to PVI-modified ones in low temperature and high rel-ative humidity. But in high temperature and low relative humidity, proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PVI-modified nanoparticles is observed to be more than PSV-modified ones and even at 145 ◦C the proton conductivity of PPBI/SiO2-PVI 15% is more than PPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%.

Consequently, high proton conductiv-ity can be a result of these changes. It should be mentioned that in temperatures higher than 100 ◦C and in very low relative humidity, water uptake of PSV-modified membranes decreases which leads to low efficiency of the sulfonic groups attached onto the surface of the nanoparticles which in turn results in a decrease in proton conduc-tivity in both membranes, but the increase in proton conductivity resulting from high doping level is significant and also the proton conductivity of PVI-modified nanocomposite membranes increase in high temperatures.', 'It is noteworthy that Nafion® 117 shows relatively low pro-ton conductivities under anhydrous conditions and almost lacks its proton conductivities at high temperatures. Comparing to Nafion®117 membranes, the high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicate that this membrane could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', '3.5.

Introduction of modified and un-modified nanoparticles increases the brittleness of the nanocomposite mem-branes with a decrease in their elongations at break. The effects of modified and unmodified nanoparticles on the elongations at break of the nanocomposite membranes were different. The decrease in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness were widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inorganic reinforcement [37–39].

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25�C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 �C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 �10�4 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 �0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 �C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 �C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by significant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of �4 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers.', '�2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through proton exchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Nafion�as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18].', 'Transport properties and nanostructure of sulfonated polyimide (SPI) membranes have been studied using pulsed field gradient NMR and NMR quadrupolar relaxation rates determinations [19,20], and small angle scattering methods (SAXS and SANS), respectively [21,22].', 'The microstructure of sulfonated polyetherether ketone (sPEEK) has been investigated by SAXS [12]. We recently reported a class of ionomers based on aromatic hydrocarbon copolymers with high proton conductivity and excellent thermal mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states [22e29]. Sulfonated poly-arylenethioethersulfone(SPTES)copolymershavefollowing chemical structures (Fig. 1).', 'SPTES copolymers including SPTES-50, SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80, have equivalent weight (EW) and IEC (mequiv./g) values of 610, 515, 459, 417, and 1.64, 1.94, 2.18, and 2.4, respectively [22]. They exhibited proton conductivity of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm respectively, at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity [22]. Their excellent proton conductivity at high temperatures combined with their high glass transition temperature (w200 �C) and mechanical stability (both in the dry and hydrated states) make them excellent potentials as high temperature PEM materials for fuel cells. SPTES-50 copolymer membrane has successfully been fabricated to membrane electrode assemblies and exhibited polarization curves and durability up to 400 h [29]. Their successful operations at 90e100 �C were limited by boiling point of water (100 �C at 1 atm). Replacing water molecules with heterocycles such as imidazolium where the charge carrier has a very low vapor pressure can result in proton conductivity at higher temperatures. Despite excellent electrochemical properties, excessive water uptake of SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes provide difficulties to be made as membrane electrode assembly [22,27] The proton transport and performance of SPTES copolymers highly depend on the presence of water molecules. In addition to the number of sulfonic groups, their acidity (pKa) ability to dissociate water molecules to proton, water activity coefficient, and number of water molecules associated with each sulfonic group, the supermolecular structure of the hydro-phobic and hydrophilic phases is also defined by polymer chain characteristics such as chain persistent length, and presence of sulfonic group on the backbone or in the side chains. We reported the presence of ionic nanodomains containing water molecules in the SPTES-70 using in-situ x-ray scattering [27]. The morphology and the nanostructure of SPTES-50 were approximated by corre-lated polydisperse spherical aggregates and a larger scale water domain network and were quantified by modeling of the SANS spectra with polydisperse hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [29]. This study reports the nanostructure and morphology of sulfonated polyarylenethioethersulfone (SPTES) copolymer membranes which is directly related to the proton transport through the membrane in terms of their degree of sulfonation and temperature dependency.', '2. Materials and methods', '2.1. Materials', 'Visually observed defect free films of SPTES copolymers were prepared by dissolving the purified copolymer in dimethyl acet-amide (DMAc, Sigma Aldrich) (5e10 wt%) filtering, placing in a flat dish in a vacuum oven with a gradual temperature rise to 100 �C for 24 h and 120 �C for 2 h. The resulting uniform flat films were immersed for 2 h in deionized water and dried under vacuum (24 h, 80 �C) after they were acidified in sulfuric acid (4 M, 24 h) to ensure complete conversion of sulfonic groups to their protonated forms.', '2.2. Characterization', 'SANS experiments were performed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Neutron Center for Research using 30 m NG-7 SANS instrument with a neutron wavelength, l, of 6 Å (Dl/l ¼ 10%) and three sample-to-detector distance of 1.5 m, 10 m (l ¼ 6 Å), and 15 m (l ¼ 8 Å), 0.001 < q < 0.3168 Å�1 at 25, and 55 �C (accuracy of 0.5 �C). Hydrated membranes were placed in demountable 1 mm thick titanium liquid cells filled with D2O after equilibrium in D2O (24 h). Scattered intensities were reduced, corrected for the transmission and background and placed on absolute scale. Then, circularly averaged to produce absolute scale scattering intensity, I(q), as a function of the wave vector, q, where q ¼ (4p/l)sin(q/2) and q is the scattering angle. Calculations were performed using Igor Pro�software [30,31]. USANS experiments covered a q-range of 0.00005 < q (Å�1) < 0.01, corresponding to a real-space length scale of 0.1 microne10 micron.', '3. Results and discussions', '3.1. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 25 �C', 'SPTES copolymers have high proton conductivity at high relative humidities and elevated temperatures; e.g. 65 �C and 85% RH of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers, respectively [27]. The degree of sulfonation increases for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6%, respectively. SPTES-50 copolymer has the lowest the degree of sulfonation and SPTES-80 copolymer has the highest degree of sulfonation in this class of copolymers [22,27]. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers at 25 �C show a scattering behavior of a two phase structure (Fig. 2a). The contribution of sulfonic groups to the scattering is considered to be negligible due to their small volume compared to the polymer and the water phase volume. It was visually observed that membranes do not dissociate when fully hydrated in the examined temperature. It was also determined by weight measurement that the membranes maintain the weight after deswelling. Therefore, the hydrophobic polymeric structure is the supporting network even at high water content and increased temperatures. Fig. 2a presents enhanced scattering intensity data (vertically shifted) for the hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copol-ymer membranes in the order of 20X, 1000X, and 2 �105X for the clarity of data presentation. The absolute scale scattering intensities in the medium q range of 0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1 are almost in the same intensity range for all SPTES copolymers. The high q scattering spectra for all copolymers exhibit a feature which is attributed to the presence of ionic domains containing water molecules. According to the scattering results, the morphology of all hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C can be approximated as correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates with liquid-like ordering (P.Y. ordering) and a power law decay [29]. The scattering data for the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C were compared and quantified using polydisperse (Schulz polydispersity) hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [32e34] and a low q power law decay [29]. The modeling of the SPETS 50 nanostructure and its properties have been reported elsewhere but presented here for clarity and completeness of the SPTES series analysis [29]. Fig. 2b shows the experimental scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 25 �C compared with the theoretical calculations of the model (solid line). The results of the comparison of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes scattering data with the model are summarized in Table 1. According to this modeling the domain radius increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 13.45,14.9,15.4, and 16.9 Å for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes. The hard sphere packing density increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 19.8%, 23%, 25%, 29% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. This could indicate that ionic domains are capable of holding more water molecules with the presence of more sulfonic groups on the polymer backbone (increasing the degree of sulfonation). The high-q scattering spectra exhibits onset of a peak formation when the degree of sulfonation was increased to 71.6% for SPTES-80 copolymer. Pres-ence of scattering maxima can be due to the scattering from an ordered structure (periodicity) or the oscillations resulted from the structural factor effects or the excluded volume effect arising from short range liquid-like ordering. The onset of peak formation is attributed to the excluded volume effects related to the liquid-like ordering [33e35]. The low-q power law decay of nearly �3 was observed for all SPTES copolymers in the range of 1 �10�4 < q (1/ Å) < 3 �10�3. The power law decay of �3 is attributed to the presence of interacting three-dimensional fractal morphology. In addition, a Guinier plateau [35] was present for the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer at the very low q (q (1/Å) < 9 �10�5). This is in addition to the nearly identical scattering intensity in the inter-mediate q-range (0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1). It can be concluded that the change in the degree of sulfonation had little or no effect on the intermediate and low angle scattering wave vector. The low-q power law decay was nearly �3 �0.1 for all SPTES copolymers. The presence of sharp interface between hydrophobic and hydro-philic domains was deduced from the power law decay of �4 at large angle wave vectors for all hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes. All scattering data presented in Fig. 2a shows a power slope of �3.85 to �4.15 which is approximated as w �4. The presence of Porod behavior (decay of �4) has been attributed to the two immiscible phase with a sharp boundary [35e37]. This shows that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are separated with a distinct interface containing sulfonic groups.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Presence of a plateau in the scattering spectra is characteristics of isolated scatterers [35]. The radius of gyration (Rg) of the isolated scatterers can be approximated by IðqÞ ¼ I0expðð�q2R2gÞ=3Þ, where I0 is the extrapolated zero scattering intensity (Guinier approxi-mation) [35]. Presence of the Guinier plateau in the q range of 4.3 �10�5 < q (1/Å) < 8.2 �10�5 for SPTES-80 copolymer suggests segregation of the isolated large scale hydrophilic water pockets when the degree of sulfonation increased to 71.6%. Radius of gyration of the isolated larger scale water pockets in fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was 1.3 �0.18 micron which was calculated from this approximation (Fig. 2c).', '@', '@', '3.2. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 55 �C', 'Based on the physical observations, water saturated membranes at 55 �C were swollen films without visual dissociation. Fig. 3 exhibits the scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. The inter-mediate scattering intensity decreased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes start to form scattering maxima at high q range when the degree of sulfonation increased. This indicated the increase in the excluded volume due to the increase in the volume of the scatterers at higher degree of sulfonation and increased temperature (55 �C). The presence of scattering maxima is more significant for SPTES-70 copolymer and SPTES-80 copolymer with 63.3 and 71.6% degree of sulfonation. The large angle scattering feature shows scattering maxima at qmax of 0.103 and 0.1108 1/Å for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers which correspond to spatial characteristics lengths (l ¼ 2p/qmax) of 60.97 and 56.7 Å due to concentration fluctuations of hydrated domains (hard spheres). The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes changed significantlywith increasing degree of sulfonation. This indicates a substantial change in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology with increasing degree of sulfonation at 55 �C which is more pronounced for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers (degree of sulfonation 63.3 and 71.6%, respectively). Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are segregated distinctly by the sulfonic groups at the interface which is repre-sented by the Porod behavior, asymptotic behavior of w �4 for all SPTES copolymers [35e37]. The morphology of these membranes is complex and controlled by interfacial phenomena. The number of sulfonic groups per repeat unit volume and their acidity com-plemented with the chain persistent length and chain mobility are governing factors in the formed morphology. This study approxi-mates the morphology of the fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55 �C are approximated as spherical nanodomains containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering similar to their morphology at 25 �C. It is also proposed that this morphology changedtofractalmorphologywithincreasing temperature (increasing the intermediate scattering decay). The domain radius and the sphere packing density were increased from 26.4 Å and 28% for SPTES-50 copolymer to 32 Å and 33% for SPTES-60copolymerwhiletheintermediatescatteringintensity decreased. The domain radius and packing density of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane increased from 13.45 Å and 19.8% to 26.4 Å and 28% when the temperature increased from 25 �C to 55 �C with this approximation. The same increasing trend of 14.9 Åe32 Å for the average domain radius and 23%e33% of the sphere packing density was observed. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane compared to the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane is attributed to the disruption of the large scale morphology. The low q power law decay of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane was close to the decay of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane.', 'The increase in the degree of sulfonation of SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymers from 54.9, to 63.3 and 71.6% resulted in a shift in the position of the high q scattering maxima of the hydrated membranes toward the large angle scattering regime. This peak formation is more prominent for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copoly-mers with higher sulfonation degree. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering intensity in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers is attributed to the loss of the large scale water network, intermediate fractal morphology within the polymer and onset of a morphology change to a two large scale phase morphology. The closed domain morphology of polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with fractal network were present for fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55�C (Figs. 3 and 4a). However, substantialchangesinthemorphologyoffullyhydrated membranes occurred when the degree of sulfonation is increased to 63.3 and 71.6% for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers at higher temperature of 55 �C. Combination of high temperature, high density of sulfonic groups, and significant amount of water mole-cules within the polymer backbone could have resulted in the coalescence of the small spherical ionic domains and fractal water network into a larger scale bicontinuous network of intermeshed hydrophobic and hydrophilic morphology for fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane at 55 �C. The bicontinuous model origi-nally proposed for micro-emulsion of two immiscible phases of water and oil with comparable amount based on Landau theory [38,39]. This model describes two irregular shapes with distinct boundary and has been used for intermesh of hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure when the particle shape is not well-defined [40,41]. This model proposes I(q) ¼ (a2þc1q þ c2q2)�1 for a2 > 0, c1 < 0, and c2 > 0, a single broad scattering maxima, and power law decay of �4 at large scattering angles. Two characteristics lengths of d and x are deduced from this analysis having a2, c1, and c2[39,40], d is the domain periodicity or interdomain distance and x is the correlation length which has been attributed to the dispersion of d. According to this theory, c1 is negative due to the surfactant. The absolute values of c1 and the ratio of x/d should increase with increasing surfactant. The specific internal surface area can be derived from the ratio of S/V ¼ 44(1�4)/x [38,39].', 'The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane has a low-q upturn, a lower intermediate scattering intensity compared to the hydrated SPTES-60 and SPTES-50 copolymers, and a large angle maxima followed by a power law decay of �4. This indicates the onset of the coalescence of the ionic aggregates, disruption of the fractal water network, and the formation of the two irregular large scale bicontinuous phase morphology. The high q range (q > 0.037 1/Å) of the scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 55 �C was compared with the T.S. bicontinuous model (Fig. 4b). This simulation resulted in a periodicity, d, of 59.9 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima position, 60.97 Å. According to this simulation, the correlation length (x) is 31.14 Å. The medium-q range scattering still exhibits the larger scale morphology which is not completely converted to the bi-continuous phase morphology. However, they are partially collapsed characterized by a lower scattering intensity in the intermediate q range. The high q maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 is approximated as bicontinuous morphology. The low and medium q (q < 0.037 1/Å) scattering spectra of the SPTES 70 is due to the presence of fractal network of waters which have not coalesce yet.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The scattering spectra of the SPTES-80 copolymer are consistent with a bicontinuous two phase structure of irregular shapes with sulfonic groups as interfacial ionic region. The scattering experi-mental data of the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was compared with this model (q > 0.015 1/Å), (Fig. 4c and Table 2). The periodicity of the water domains (or hydrophobic domains), d, predicted by this model is w54 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima (qmax), 56.7 Å. This value is the distance between water domains. The correlation length (x) obtained from this model is 37.86 Å which is a measure of dispersion.', 'The distance between the water phases, periodicity, was decreased from 59.9 Å to 54 Å with increasing degree of sulfona-tion. The correlation length, x, was increased from 31.14 Å to 37.86 Å when the degree of sulfonation increased. Increasing the interfacial area results in an increase in the x/d ratio. The presence of the upturn in the low range of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 at 55 �C (Fig. 4b and c) is attributed to the fractal morphology of the large scale features.', '3.3. Discussions', 'Scattering data of series of SPTES membranes were obtained in the full hydration state with increasing the sulfonation degree in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. Complete study was performed to provide understanding membranes morphology with increasing the temperature of the hydrated membranes from 25 �C to 55 �C. Proposed model assumes spherical nanodomains containing water molecules forming from clustering of the sulfonation groups. This assumption was performed based on previously reported study which showed spherical nanodomains in the dry SPTES 50 membrane under HR-TEM [29]. The scattering spectra of the membranes with high degree of sulfonation (SPTES 70, and 80) changed significantly when the temperature increased to 55 �C. The morphology is approximated as bi-continuous system where the hydrocarbon is the main support network containing water. This model has been recently proposed by Wnek et al. [40], Gebel [8], and Kreuer [12], Wnek also provided visualization of the hydro-phobic cluster using SYBYL version 6.7 (Tripos) and HINT (Hydro-pathicINTeractions)computationalmodelingsoftware[40]. Despite the support of the transport studies of this model [42], there is no direct visualization method for this proposed approxi-mation. The T. S. model is also supported by high proton conduc-tivity of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 membranes at 55 �C where a larger number of hydronium ions in a larger domain can facilitate proton transport. A summary of the structural evolution of the SPTES membranes as a function of temperature and degree of sulfonation is illustrated in Table 3. This study attempted to study a full range of SPTES membrane nanostructure for the first time and provide an understanding of large membrane water uptakes, and their morphology and their relation with high conductivity of the membranes using both liquid like ordering of polydisperse nano-spheres and bi-continuous T.S. model approximation.', '@', '@', 'Table 3 Summary of membrane structural changes (SPTES 50, 60, 70, and 80 at 25 �C, and SPTES 50 and 60 at 55 �C) as a function of degree of sulfonation and temperature by polydisperse hard sphere model with liquid-like ordering ordering). T.S. bi-continuous model was approximated for higher sulfonation degree copolymers, SPTES 70 and 80, at 55 �C.', '@', '4. Conclusions', 'A series of SPTES copolymers with high proton conductivity of 100e215 mS/cm at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity as potential fuel cells membranes were studied. SANS studies of fully hydrated membranes showed that the nanostructure of the fully hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C in agreement with ionic aggregates containing water molecules with a large scale morphology network of water pockets morphology. This model predicted that the increase in the degree of sulfonation resulted in an increase in the radius of ionic domains and an increase in the volume packing density of water in the aggregates. It was assumed that the same morphology of polydisperse correlated spherical ionic domains were present in the SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymers when the temperature increased to 55 �C. Increase in the degree of sulfonation for fully hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer at 55 �C led to a substantial reorganization of the membrane morphology which was described by a bi-continuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic network.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to thank the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Nano-structured andBiological Materials Branch forfunding this research.

And polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared through radical polymerization of 1-vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface-vinylated nanoparticles. The polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were utilized as a functional additive to prepare PPBI/polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. Imida-zole and sulfonated vinylbenzene groups on the surface of modified nanoparticles forming linkages with PPBI chains, improved the compatibility between PPBI and nanoparticles, and enhanced the mechanical strength of the prepared nanocomposite membranes. The prepared nanocomposite membranes showed higher water uptake and acid doping levels comparing to PPBI. Also, after acid doping with phosphoric acid, nanocomposite membranes exhibited enhanced proton conductivity in comparison to the pristine PPBI and PPBI/un-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. The enhancement in proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes resulted from modified SiO2 nanoparticles showed higher conductivity than modified TiO2 nanoparticles.

All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang- ers [1–3]. Sulfonated polysulfone (PSF) [4], polyetheretherketone (PEEK) [5,6] and polybenzimidazoles (PBIs) [7–11] are among poly-mers which can be used as alternatives for Nafion in PEFCs.', 'Amongpolybenzimidazolederivatives,poly[2,2-5,5(m-phenylene)-bibenzimidazole](PBI),whichisalsocalled commercial polybenzimidazole have been used as a mem-brane material in PEMFCs. Having high chemical as well as thermal resistance and proton conductivity, polybenzimidazoles are great options to be used in the fuel cells with function at elevated temperatures above 100 ◦C [12].', 'PBIs should have enough proton conductivity so that it could be used as proton exchange membranes in the fuel cells. To achieve this purpose, they are usually doped with a sufficient acid like H3PO4 to an appropriate doping level [13]. Nanocomposite membranes are a new group of membranes which contain nanopar-ticles such as SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 and other compounds [14–21]. The introduction of nanoparticles into the membranes results in a considerable improvement in their features like mechani-cal properties, methanol permeability, but in some cases leads to a decrease in proton conductivity [22–24]. In order to over-come this problem, surface functionalized nanoparticles, which means various compounds with polar groups grafted chemically to the surface of the nanoparticles [25–28], were used. As men-tioned before, the numerous research works were done concerning grafting various compounds on the SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles which used for different purposes. However, in this work, we have used monomer bearing functional groups like imidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene which can improve the properties of pro-ton conductive membranes. These monomers are polymerized on the surface of the nanoparticles and as a consequence, they can more affect the properties of the membranes than while one functional group is grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. In addition, the polymerization of the selected monomers such as vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface of nanoparticle could cause more compatibility between nanopar-ticles and polymer matrix which finally improve the mechanical properties. In this work, nanocomposite membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles and newly synthesized polybenzimidazole was depicted poly[2,2-5,5-(m-pyrazolidene)-bibenzimidazole] (PPBI). Modification of the mentioned nanoparticles was performed by radical polymerization of some vinyl monomers such as sulfonated styrene and vinylim-idazole on the surface of the nanoparticles to which vinylic group was bounded covalently. Also, the effect of surface modification on the properties of the nanocomposite membranes such as pro-ton conductivity, mechanical properties and water uptake were studied.', '@', '@', '2.

The absence of absorbent peak related to amine group proton (N–H) in the area of 4.0–5.0 ppm and an absorbent related to amide group in the area of 10.3–10.6 ppm show the complete closure of imidazole rings during the polycondensation reaction.', 'In FT-IR characteristics of PPBI, the presence of absorbent bands in 800 cm−1 is related to the vibration of C–H bond of imida-zole, a band in about 1300 cm−1 is related to the vibration of C–N bond of imidazole, the absorbent band in 1450 cm−1 is related to C N and C C vibrations and bands in the area of 3400 cm−1 and 3140 cm−1 are related to N–H vibrations.

The presence of the absorbent bands in 3050 cm−1 and 3100 cm−1 can be related to aromatic C–H bonds and also the existence of bands in the area of 2950 cm−1 can be attributed to aliphatic C–H bonds. Also the peaks in 1619 and 1419 cm−1 can be due to C C and C N bonds. In Fig. 4(c), the presence of the absorbent band in 1257 cm−1 is cor-responded to S O bond of the sulfonic acid group. These prove the existence of polymeric chains that are grafted onto the nanoparticle surface.', 'FT-IR spectra of the modified nanoparticles have been measured after complete washing and drying.

After filtration, the washing method used to wash the modified nanoparticles, was applied to the resulting powder as well. The FT-IR spectrum of the obtained powder did not show any absorbent bands related to PVI and PSV chains. The absorbent bands, which existed in the spectrum of mod-ified nanoparticles, were not observed in this spectrum. So, it was indicated that the polymeric chains have been attached to the par-ticles surface via covalent bonds.', '3.2. Thermal analysis', 'Thermogravimetric analysis diagrams of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 5. Weight loss in 85 ◦C can be related to the release of physically absorbed water. In un-modified nanoparticles, the minor weight loss in elevated temperatures can be attributed to the loss of hydroxyl groups of the particle surface attached by covalent bonds. Weight loss in modified nanoparticles could be a result of thermal degradation of the polymeric chains grafted to the surface of the nanoparti-cles. Also, the weight loss in 230–300 ◦C was due to the thermal decomposition of the sulfonate groups in the grafted PSV chains [30].', 'Thermograms of PVI modified nanocomposite with 5, 10 and 15% of TiO2 are shown in Fig. 6. As it is observed, the thermal prop-erties of the nanocomposites prepared with various amounts of TiO2 are almost similar. For this reason, in order to compare the thermal properties of other nanocomposites which prepared with modified nanoparticles having different monomers, only the TGA thermograms of nanocomposite containing of 10% (between 5% and 15%) modified nanoparticles are reported.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The remaining weight percentage in 850 ◦C is related to the modified TiO2 that is less than the added amount of PVI-modified TiO2 nanoparticles when the membrane was prepared. This decrease in weight in comparison with the theoretical amount could be related due to the degradation of the chains grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. Also, in order to obtain the par-ticular weight of the modified nanoparticles, specific amounts of modified and un-modified nanoparticles were weighed after and before complete burning out all the polymers. They were heated to temperatures about 1000 ◦C for 30 min and the obtained nanoparti-cles were weighed immediately. The difference between the weight of un-modified nanoparticles before and after heating shows the amount of lost water which was either physically absorbed or pro-duced from the condensation reaction of the hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticle surface. Also from the difference between the weight of modified nanoparticles before and after heating and consider- ing the weight of lost water, the percentage of the grafted polymer onto the nanoparticle surface was obtained. The obtained results and theoretical amounts are shown in Table 1. The amounts of the obtained results in all cases are more than theoretical values. This could be related to the presence of free water molecules and hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticles surface in which their values are not subtracted from theoretical values.', '@', '@', 'The diagrams of thermogravimetric analysis of both PPBI and nanocomposites prepared from the modified nanoparticles (10% w/w) are shown in Fig. 7.

As a result, the addition of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles do not have any noticeable effect on thermal stability of the prepared nanocomposites.', 'As it is observed in Fig. 7, the degradation of PVI-modified nanoparticles occurs at 185 ◦C which is lower than the related tem-perature of PSV-modified ones. Therefore, the former one can be used in fuel cells with performance under 150 ◦C, but PSV-modified membrane is more suitable in high temperature fuel cells.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '3.3. Water uptake and doping level', 'Water uptake amount of nanocomposite membranes contain-ing 5, 10 and 15% of modified nanoparticles at 25 ◦C are shown in Fig. 8. Addition of silica nanoparticles to PPBI membranes increased their water uptakes due to the hygroscopic nature of SiO2 and TiO2nanoparticles. The sulfonic and imidazole groups in the nanopar-ticles increased the water uptake to a greater extent. The amount of water uptake for PPBI/TiO2-PSV, PPBI/SiO2-PSV, PPBI/TiO2-PVI and PPBI/SiO2-PVI are 21.6, 22.7, 20.4 and 21.9%, respectively. The effect of sulfonic acid groups of PSV chains grafted onto the nanoparticle surface on the water uptake is more than imidazole groups in PVI chains due to the higher hygroscopic properties of PSV comparing to PVI chains grafted on to the silica nanopar-ticle surface. The water uptake of PPBI/SiO2-PSV is higher than PPBI/TiO2-PSV which can be due to the further increase of the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles in comparison to TiO2 nanoparticle surface.', 'The PPBI-based membranes were doped with 85% H3PO4 to prepare the acid-doped membranes. Fig. 9 shows the acid-doping levels of the PPBI-based nanocomposite membranes.

Even in the comparison of these membranes with the simi-lar ones which prepared from modified TiO2 such as PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, the amount of water uptake and doping level were higher. This shows that using modified SiO2 nanoparticles in fuel cells is more appropriate.', '3.4. Proton conductivity', 'The membrane was sandwiched between two stainless steel electrodes and pressed together by clamp. Then, the MEA (Mem-brane Electrolyte Assembly) was inputted in the steam autoclave equipped with temperature controller.

As an example, for saturated steam the pressure cor-responding to 120 ◦C is 205 kPa. The time of exposure to saturated steam at 120 ◦C was 30 min that this value for temperature of 140 ◦C was increased to 50 min.', 'Fig. 10 shows the Nyquist plot and equivalent circuit of studied membranes at 25 ◦C and RH 100% for some membranes.', 'After fitting the EIS experimental data on the electrical equiv-alent circuit, the membrane proton conductivity was determined from the intercept of EIS data with real impedance Z′ axis (as the value of Rm element). In equivalent circuit, Rm presents the resis-tance of the polymer film between the two metallic electrodes toward charge carriers (i.e. H+). L1 presents the stray inductance of the setup wires.

The pro-ton conductivities of all membranes increased with increasing the operation temperature up to 80 ◦C. Addition of the un-modified nanoparticles showed a negative effect on the proton conductivities of nanocomposite membranes. Similar trends were also reported to other nanocomposite membranes like Nafion®/silica membranes and PBI/silica membranes [31].', '@', '@', 'On the other hand, comparing the pristine PPBI and Nafion®117 membranes, the relatively high proton conductivities of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles are noteworthy [32]. Li et al. have used sulfonated organosilica to modify Nafion® membranes and they found that the proton con-ductivities of the modified membranes were still lower than that of the neat Nafion® membrane.', 'The reduction in the proton conductivity was attributed to the silica-induced changes in the tortuous paths and in the dis-tribution of hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains. However, in this work an enhancing effect on the proton conductivity was observed with addition of PSV and PVI grafted nanoparticles to PPBI mem-brane. The sulfonic and imidazole groups of modified nanoparticles also contribute in the acid-doping effect to PPBI polymer so as to enhance the proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles. Moreover, the presence of modified nanoparticles induces proton conductive pathways lead-ing to an increase in the proton conductivities of PPBI/modified nanoparticles membranes [24].', 'The proton conductivities of the acid-doped nanocompos-ite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 12) were further studied at high temperatures under an anhydrous environment. All the PPBI/modified nanoparticle membranes still exhibited higher proton conductivities than the pristine acid-doped PPBI membrane.', '@', '@', 'Generally, two principle mechanisms of vehicle mechanism and Grotthuss mechanism (hopping) describe proton diffusion through the membrane [33]. It is possible that the bounded water par-ticipates by the Grotthuss mechanism, and the free water takes part mostly by vehicle mechanism [34]. Addition of silica-SO3H to the membranes increases the bounded water content in the membranes (Fig. 13). The bounded water facilitates the proton transport ability through the Grotthuss mechanism, originating by generation of a continuous proton conductive pathway. There-fore, the high proton conductivity of PPBI/modified nanoparticles can be attributed to the high bounded water content in the membrane.', 'Since the Grotthuss-type diffusion mechanism without assis-tance of the vehicle mechanism has been proposed for the protonconductionunderanhydrousenvironments[35,36], theprotonconductivityoftheacid-dopedPPBI/modified nanoparticlemembranescouldbesynergisticallyresulted from their modified nanoparticle contents and the acid-doping levels.', 'Consequently, the highest proton conductivity was obtained withtheacid-dopedPPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%membraneathigh humidity and low temperatures and PPBI/SiO2-PVI-15% mem-brane in high temperatures and low humidity, which possesses the moderate modified nanoparticles content and acid-doping level.', 'As it is seen in Fig. 9, either we use PSV-modified or un-modified nanoparticles, the increase in the amount of the nanoparticles leads to a decrease in the acid doping level, but when PVI-modified nanoparticles were used, doping level increased. Also, according to Fig. 8, water uptake of the membrane shows an increase when using higher amounts of modified nanoparticles. This increase in PSV-modified nanocomposite membranesishigherinPVI-modified one. Proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PSV-modified nanoparticles shows significant increase in comparison to PVI-modified ones in low temperature and high rel-ative humidity. But in high temperature and low relative humidity, proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PVI-modified nanoparticles is observed to be more than PSV-modified ones and even at 145 ◦C the proton conductivity of PPBI/SiO2-PVI 15% is more than PPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%. The exis-tence of modified nanoparticles in PPBI nanocomposite membranes results in high proton conductivity in three ways:', '@', '@', '1) With increase in water uptake 2) With increase in the amount of doping level and 3) With increase in the number of proton conductive functional groups such as sulfonic acid group.', 'In PSV-modified nanocomposite membranes, acid doping decreases while the water uptake and the number of sulfonic acid groups shows an increase. Consequently, high proton conductiv-ity can be a result of these changes. It should be mentioned that in temperatures higher than 100 ◦C and in very low relative humidity, water uptake of PSV-modified membranes decreases which leads to low efficiency of the sulfonic groups attached onto the surface of the nanoparticles which in turn results in a decrease in proton conduc-tivity in both membranes, but the increase in proton conductivity resulting from high doping level is significant and also the proton conductivity of PVI-modified nanocomposite membranes increase in high temperatures.', 'It is noteworthy that Nafion® 117 shows relatively low pro-ton conductivities under anhydrous conditions and almost lacks its proton conductivities at high temperatures. Comparing to Nafion®117 membranes, the high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicate that this membrane could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', '3.5. Mechanical properties', 'The mechanical properties of the PPBI-based membranes were measured. The stress–strain curves are shown in Fig. 14. Pristine PPBI membrane showed an elongation at break of 38%. Mod-ification of nanocomposites with SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles results in an increase in the tensile strengths and a subse-quent decrease in the elongations at break for the PPBI-based membranes. For PPBI/modified nanoparticles nanocomposites membranes (PPBI/modified nanocomposite consists of the PPBI and surface-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles by PVI and PSV chains and PPBI/unmodified nanocomposite includes PPBI and SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles without any treatment), the presence of ionic linkages between PPBI and silica particles can be assigned to their high Young’s modulus. Introduction of modified and un-modified nanoparticles increases the brittleness of the nanocomposite mem-branes with a decrease in their elongations at break. The effects of modified and unmodified nanoparticles on the elongations at break of the nanocomposite membranes were different. The decrease in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness were widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inorganic reinforcement [37–39].

If the interactions between silica nanoparticles are stronger than that of between PPBI molecules and silica nanoparticles, the silica nanoparticles are agglomerated together to form silica domains in micrometer sizes. The compatibility between PPBI and unmodified nanoparticles and the homogene-ity of the PPBI/SiO2 or PPBI/TiO2 membranes are somewhat poor [32].', 'However, the dispersion homogeneity of silica nanoparticles in PPBI membranes could be significantly improved with using surface modified nanoparticles as the additives. As shown in Fig. 16(b), the dispersion homogeneity of modified nanoparticles is observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2 nanocomposite membrane, which demonstrates high compatibility between PPBI polymer and PSV-SiO2 nanoparticles and the high dispersion abil-ity of PSV-SiO2 in PPBI matrix. Particle agglomeration is still not observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2-10%. The ionic linkages between PPBI and modified nanoparticles are contributed to their higher compatibility [32]. However, in nanocompos-ite membranes prepared from un-modified SiO2 nanoparticles, thedispersionofthenanoparticlesinpolymermatrixis not homogenous and probably aggregation has been formed (Fig. 16(c)).', '@', '@', '4. Conclusion', 'The nanocomposite PPBI-based membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified and un-modified TiO2 and SiO2nanoparticles. The thermal stability of the prepared nanocompos- ite membranes was similar to PPBI membrane. The water uptake of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from TiO2/PSV and SiO2/PSV nanoparticles were higher than other nanocomposite membranes. The acid doping level and proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes in dry conditions obtained from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI nanoparticles were the highest in comparison to PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV. Formation of nanocomposites with modified and un-modified nanoparticles resulted the increas-ing of tensile strengths. The decreasing in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness was widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inor-ganic reinforcement. The high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicated that this membrane could be utilized as a proton exchange membrane for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. M.-G.

The silica capillary was aminated with (3-aminopropyl)tri-  methoxysilane, followed by reaction with glutaraldehyde, and finally the free aldehyde  groups were acetalized with PVA. With these PVA-immobilized capillary columns, separa-  tions of cationic and anionic proteins were successful. Tour and his coworkers [111]  extended their research work on the application of nanoparticles in the oil-field industry to  carbon black nanoparticles (CB NPs) functionalized with PVA. In the aim to determine the  content extent of oil in the downhole well, novel approach is to transport “hydrocarbon  compounds” acting as “probe molecules” through nanomater- ials called “nanocarriers”.  One of the promising candidates in this issue is the use of CB nanoparticles on which PVA  chains (MW ¼ 50 kDa) are appended. To achieve such goal, CB NPs were first treated with  4,40-azobis(4-cyanopentanoic acid) (ACPA) to provide carboxyl groups, followed by  esterification with PVA applying DCC strategy, aXording PVA-g-CB NPs (200–300 nm) (Eq.  23). And, in view to ensure the stability of surfactants in the conditions of high temperature  and salinity of the well, sulfatation of the grafted PVA chains was performed with ClSO3 H.

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated  SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated  by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic  domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated  SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation.  SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very  low q range (q < 1  104 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (R g ¼  1.3  0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 C, but  the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the  sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial  morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous  hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer  membranes at 55 C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of 4 for  SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase  morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 C).

Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and  71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the  spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for  the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 C. Presence of ionic  maxima followed by a power law decay of 4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer  membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of  sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal  morphology was characterized by significant decrease in the intermediate scattering  intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic  groups at the interface showing as power law decay of 4 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers. Sulfonated polyarylenethioethersulfone (SPTES) copolymers with high proton conductivity  (100 e215 mS/cm at 65 C, 85% relative humidity) are promising potential proton exchange', 'membrane (PEM) for fuel cells. Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated  SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated  by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic  domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated  SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation.

The  acetylation ofthe  extracted xylan was  carried  in  DMAC/LiCl/pyridine system to  obtain a series  of  xylan acetates with differentdegrees of substitution (DS).  Structure elucidation of  xylan and  xylan acetate was obtained by 1H  and 13C  NMR  spectroscopy and  other homonuclear and  heteronuclear 2D-NMR techniques. Inverse-gated 13C  NMR  was  employed to  determine the  DS  of  xylan acetate. Furthermore, results  also  revealed equal reactivities at  the  C-2  and  C-3  positions of  xylan towards acetylation. Thermal stability, solubility behaviorand  nanofiber formation of  xylan acetate were  influenced by  its  DS  values. The  mechanical properties of  xylan acetate propionate were also  investigated.', '© 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'Renewable materials have been the subject of much research with the aim to replace non-biodegradable petroleum-based polymers. Numerous studies have exploited the use of plant polysaccharides (e.g. cellulose and starch) as substrates for chem-ical modification. These products were used to develop plastics, films and nanofibers (Amim, Kosaka, Petri, Maia, & Miranda, 2009; Son, Youk, & Park, 2006; Yang & Montgomery, 2008). In addition, they were also considered suitable for agricultural (e.g. controlled release of fertilizers) and medical applications (e.g. hemodialysis and blood filtration) (Aburto et al., 1999).', 'Aside from cellulose and starch, hemicelluloses also represent one of the most abundant renewable polysaccharides found in nature. They belong to the second largest class of lignocellulosic materials which comprise about one-fourth to one-third of the plant’s material (Fang, Sun, Fowler, Tomkinson, & Hill, 1999). The predominating polysaccharide belonging to this class is xylan. It consists of d-xylp (d-xylopyranose) units in the backbone linked by �-(1 → 4) glycosidic bonds. Depending on the source, naturally occurring xylan is usually substituted with sugar units and O-acetyl groups. Homoxylans can be isolated from higher plants such as guar seed husk (Ebringerova & Heinze, 2000). On the other hand, xylan obtained from seaweeds (Palmariales sp. and Bryopsis sp.) has a backbone of d-xylp residues linked by �-(1 → 3) or mixed �-(1 → 3) and�-(1→4)(Heinze,2005).', 'Xylan can be easily extracted by alkaline treatment with KOH, NaOH or DMSO (Janzon, Saake, & Puls, 2008). On a dry weight basis, xylan comprises 10–15% in softwoods, 10–35% in hardwoods and up to 40% of agricultural residues in annual plants (Hettrich et al., 2006). O-Acetyl-4-O-methyl glucuronoxylan and arabino-4-O-methylglucoronoxylan are the main hemicelluloses found in hardwood and in softwood, respectively (Cacais, Silveira, & Ferreira, 2001). Hardwood xylan has 4-O-methylglucuronic acid (MeGlcA) residues attached to the C-2 position of the d-xylp residues in the main chain. Approximately 10% of the d-xylp residues in hard-wood xylan have this substitution. In addition, 70% of the d-xylp residues in hardwood xylan is acetylated at the C-2 and/or C-3 positions. In contrast, for softwood xylan, 20% of the d-xylp residues are branched with MeGlcA and 13% are branched with �-l-arabinofuranose at the C-3 position (Coughlan & Hazlewood, 1993). Unlike hardwood xylan, softwood xylan is not acetylated. The degree of polymerization of xylan varies depending on the wood species from 150 to 200 in hardwoods and 70 to 130 in softwoods (Saha, 2003). The structure of xylan in annual plants is more complex due to the presence of arabinofuranose, xylopyra-nose, rhamnose, glucuronic acid and acetyl groups attached to the main chain (Hettrich & Fanter, 2010).', 'Despite xylan’s abundance in nature, cellulose and starch are more commonly used as raw materials for derivatization due to xylan’s inherent low molecular weight and heterogeneous struc-ture. Recently, xylan is gaining importance for the basis of new biopolymeric materials and functional biopolymers by chemical modification. Various studies on the esterification of arabinoxylan with different acyl compounds in homogeneous system had already been explored (Fang, Sun, Tomkinson, & Fowler, 2000; Peng et al., 2008; Ren, Sun, Liu, Cao, & Luo, 2007; Sun, Fang, Tomkinson, & Jones, 1999; Sun, Sun, & Sun, 2004). The resulting derivatives offer poten-tial applications for the production of biodegradable plastics, resins and films. Several reports have also been made on the film forming properties of xylan and its blends (Buchanan et al., 2003; Gabrielii, Gatenholm, Glasser, Jain, & Kenne, 2000; Goksu, Karamanlioglu, Bakir, Yilmaz, & Yilmazer, 2007; Kayserilioglu, Bakir, Yilmaz, & Akkas, 2003; Shaikh, Pandare, Nair, & Varma, 2009).', 'In this study, xylan from hardwood kraft pulp was isolated by NaOH extraction. Structure elucidation of the xylan based on NMR spectroscopy is discussed in this paper. This work also presents the acetylation of the extracted xylan by homogeneous reaction in DMAc/LiCl/pyridine system. Characterization of xylan acetate in terms of degree of substitution (DS) and its structural features are considered to be one of the important highlights of this research. Thermal properties, solubility behavior and nanofiber formation of xylan acetate were also investigated. In addition, the mechanical properties of xylan acetate propionate films with different DS were discussed as well.', '2. Materials and methods', '2.1.

The resulting pulp was then mixed with 10% NaOH (1:20) at room temperature. After 2 h, the mixture was filtered and the filtrate was neutralized with acetic acid.

Extraction of xylan', 'The presence of significant amount of xylan and minor lignin impurities makes hardwood paper grade pulp a good raw material for the extraction of xylan. Solvents known to extract xylan include DMSO, NaOH and KOH (Janzon et al., 2008). In this current research, 10% NaOH was used to extract xylan from hardwood kraft pulp and the yield was 6–8%. Higher alkaline concentration was also employed. Although it produced higher yield, the xylan obtained had lower Mw (data not shown).', 'In this study, different NMR experiments were conducted to elu-cidate the complete structure of the isolated xylan in DMSO-d6. The1H NMR spectrum of xylan is presented in Fig. 1a. The �-(1 → 4)-linked d-xylp units were characterized by the signals at ı 3.0, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5, 3.9 and 4.3 ppm, which correspond to H-2, H-5a, H-3, H-4, H-5e and H-1, respectively. The DQF-COSY spectrum displayed inFig. 1b confirms the assignment. Furthermore, it is noted that the two signals which are found downfield at ı 5.1 and 5.2 ppm show a weak correlation with H-3 and H-2, respectively. These signals originated from the protons of the hydroxyl groups attached at C-3 (–C–OH, ı 5.1 ppm) and C-2 (–C–OH, ı 5.2 ppm) positions of the d-xylpunitsinxylan.', 'Fig. 1c shows the 13C NMR spectrum. The five major signals at ı 63.3, 72.7, 74.0, 75.5 and 101.8 ppm are assigned to C-5, C-2, C-3, C-4 and C-1 of the d-xylp units in xylan. No other additional signals were observed indicating that the isolated xylan does not contain any acetyl groups, 4-O-methylglucuronic acid (MeGlcA), neutral sug-ars and lignin. According to literature (Teleman, Tenkanen, Jacobs, & Dahlman, 2002), acetyl groups are cleaved from its main chain during alkaline extraction. Likewise, the MeGlcA, neutral sugars and lignin may have also been removed either during the pulp-ing or extraction process. Thus, based on the above observations the isolated hemicellulose was a homoxylan.', '3.2. Characterization of xylan acetate', 'Synthesis of xylan acetate was carried out by homogeneous reaction in DMAC/LiCl/pyridine system at 50 ◦C. The structural features of xylan acetate were analyzed by employing differ-ent NMR experiments. A 1H NMR spectrum of a fully acetylated xylan (DS = 2.0) is presented in Fig. 2a. The signals within the range of ı 3.3–5.0 ppm are assigned to the ring protons of xylan acetate. The strong signal at ı 2.0 ppm arising from the methyl pro-tons (–CH3) confirms the successful acetylation of xylan. Fig. 2b presents the DQF-COSY spectrum showing the correlation between the ring protons of xylan acetate. Based on the spectrum, the signals at ı 3.3, 3.7, 3.9, 4.5, 4.7 and 5.0 ppm are assigned to H-5a, H-4, H-5e, H-1, H-2 and H-3 of xylan acetate. The weak cross peak, which is seen at ıHx/ıHy = 3.9/3.7 indicates the cor-relation between the H-5 at the equatorial position and the H-4 at the axial position. A more distinct cross peak is observed at ıHx/ıHy = 3.3/3.7 showing the correlation between the H-5 at the axial position and the H-4 at the axial position. Hence, the signals at ı 3.3 and 3.9 ppm are assigned to H-5a and H-5e, respec-tively.', 'The13C NMR spectrum of xylan acetate is presented inFig. 2c. The signal at 20.8 ppm originates from the methyl car-bons. This further supports the data indicating the acetylation of xylan. The signals at ı 62.4, 70.8, 71.8, 74.5 and 100.1 ppm are assigned to C-5, C-2, C-3, C-4 and C-1 of xylan acetate. The assignmentof the ring carbons was done by HSQC NMR anal-ysis which showed the correlation of the ring protons and ring carbons (data not shown). Furthermore, the signals at ı 169.3 and 169.8 ppm correspond to the carbonyl carbons at the C-3 and C-2 positions, respectively. The assignment of the signals was based on the data obtained from the HMBC NMR analysis which will be discussed later in this section. The absence of other sig-nals indicates that the xylan acetate was free of any unreacted reagents.', 'Each xylose unit in xylan has two hydroxyl groups available for acetylation. In order to monitor the DS, a series of xylan acetate was synthesized at varying reaction times. At 3 h reaction time, 50% of the hydroxyl groups of xylan was acetylated (DS = 1.1). Complete acetylation of xylan (DS = 2.0) was achieved within 6 h reaction time as shown in Table 1.', 'The DS of xylan acetate was investigated after perpropi-onylation of partially substituted xylan acetate followed by inverse-gated 13C-NMR analysis. During perpropionylation, any unreacted hydroxyl groups present in xylan acetate were esterified with propionic anhydride. Based on the 13C-NMR spectrum (Fig. 3), the signals found at ı 9.1 and 27.5 ppm are assigned to the methyl (–CH3) and methylene (–CH2–) protons of the propionyl groups. In addition, the carbonyl carbons of acetyl and propionyl groups are seen at different chemical shifts. Based on the HMBC spectrum shown in Fig. 3, the carbonyl carbon signals of the acetyl group at the C-2 and C-3 positions occurred at ı 169.4 and 169.9 ppm, respectively. The carbonyl carbon signals of the propionyl group at the C-2 and C-3 positions are seen at ı 172.8 and 173.3 ppm, respectively.', 'The DS of xylan acetate was calculated based on the integral of the carbonyl carbon peaks. Such method calculates not only for the total DS but also for the partial DS at the C-2 and C-3 positions of xylan acetate. The DS values are calculated applying Eqs. (1) and (2):', 'DSAc at C-2 =IAIA + IB + IC + ID× 2DSAc at C-3 =IBIA +IB +IC +ID× 2', 'I:integral; A: C OAc at C-2; B: C OAc at C-3; C: C OPr at C-2; D: C OPr at C-3.', 'Aside from the DS, the same method is used to determine the regioselectvity of the acetylation reaction. Table 1 summarizes the results of acetyl distribution for xylan acetate synthesized at differ-ent reaction times. Data show that the DS values at the C-2 and C-3 positions of xylan acetate are almost the same. This implies that the hydroxyl groups at the C-2 and C-3 positions of xylan towards acetylationreactionhaveequalreactivities.', '3.3. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)', 'One of the factors that affect the thermal properties of a polymer is its composition. The chemical modification of a polymer leads to a change in its thermal stability. Fig. 4a shows a comparison of the thermal properties of xylan and xylan acetate with different DS. The sudden drop in the curve of xylan during the early stage of heating is due to the water loss of the sample. At 50% weight loss, the decomposition temperature of xylan was at 297 ◦C. In the case of xylan acetate with a DS of 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 and 2.0, the decomposi-tion temperatures were at 294, 312, 348 and 355 ◦C, respectively. The high thermal stability of xylan acetate is brought about by the decrease in the number of remaining hydroxyl groups after acety-lation (Aburto et al., 1999). These hydroxyl groups are oxidized during heating.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Fig. 4b compares the TG curves of xylan acetate (DS = 1.1) and xylan acetate propionate (DSAc = 1.1). At 50% weight loss, the decomposition temperatures of xylan acetate and xylan acetate propionate occurred at 312 and 373 ◦C, respectively. These results indicate that the perpropionylation of partially substituted xylan acetate leads to an increase in its thermal stability. The same results were also observed with the other samples of different DS.', '3.4. Solubility', 'Altering the molecular structure of xylan by introducing a hydrophobic acyl group changes its solubility property. In this study, the solubility behavior of xylan acetate and xylan acetate propionate having different DS values in CHCl3 was investi-gated. Fig. 5 shows the solubility behavior of xylan acetate and xylan acetate propionate. The solubility of xylan acetate in CHCl3increases with an increase in DS. This is due to the increase in hydrophobicity of the polymer after acetylation. However, xylan acetate remained partially soluble in CHCl3 (∼58%) even after complete acetylation (DS = 2.0). In certain case, fully acetylated cel-lulose is also partially soluble in CHCl3 (Shaikh et al., 2009) and the use of mixed solvents provides better solubility (Bochek & Kalyuzhnaya, 2002). In the case of xylan acetate propionate, the solubility decreased with increase in the DSAc. Xylan acetate pro-pionate samples with DSAc values of 0.6 and 1.1 were completely soluble in CHCl3. The sample with a DSAc = 1.6 was still partially sol-uble in CHCl3. However, the solubility increased from 48% to 58%. This shows that the solubility of partially substituted xylan acetate is improved after perpropionylation.', '3.5. Electrospinning', 'In this study, xylan acetate nanofibers were formed by electro-spinning method using HFIP a solvent. Xylan acetate with a DS = 2.0 can be electrospun into nanofibers. Xylan acetates with DS < 2.0 were not soluble in HFIP. Fig. 6 shows the SEM image of the as spun xylan acetate nanofibers with a DS = 2.0. At 10 wt./vol.-% xylan acetate, long beaded fibers were obtained after electrospinning at 30 kV. The diameter of the nanofibers ranged from 163 to 429 nm.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '@', '3.6.Mechanical characterization of xylan acetate propionate films', 'Xylan acetate propionate with a DSAc of 0.6 and 1.1 were made into films by solvent casting method. Table 2 shows the influence of DS on the mechanical properties of the films. Tensile test results revealed that the tensile strength of the xylan acetate films slightly decreased from 48 to 46 MPa with increase in DSAc from 0.6 to 1.1. In the case of elongation at break, the value slightly decreased from 10 to 8% when the DSAc increased from 0.6 to 1.1. This is due to the presence of lesser number of propionyl groups which makes the film less flexible. Consequently, this results in a more rigid film which is reflected in the increase in the value of the Young’s modulus from 0.6 to 0.8 GPa.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '4.Conclusion', 'Alkaline extraction of xylan from eucalyptus hardwood kraft pulp with 10% NaOH obtained a yield of 6–8%.

Results revealed almost the same DS values at C-2 and C-3 positions of xylan acetate indicating the non-selectivity of the reaction.', 'The thermal stability of xylan, based on the TGA, was improved after acetylation. Likewise, the solubility of xylan in chloroform also increased after chemical modification. Perpropionylation of par-tially substituted xylan acetate showed further increase in thermal stability and solubility. Xylan acetate with a DS = 2.0 can be electro-spun into nanofibers.

The polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were utilized as a functional additive to prepare PPBI/polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. Imida-zole and sulfonated vinylbenzene groups on the surface of modified nanoparticles forming linkages with PPBI chains, improved the compatibility between PPBI and nanoparticles, and enhanced the mechanical strength of the prepared nanocomposite membranes. The prepared nanocomposite membranes showed higher water uptake and acid doping levels comparing to PPBI. Also, after acid doping with phosphoric acid, nanocomposite membranes exhibited enhanced proton conductivity in comparison to the pristine PPBI and PPBI/un-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. The enhancement in proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes resulted from modified SiO2 nanoparticles showed higher conductivity than modified TiO2 nanoparticles. The above results indicated that the PPBI/modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for medium temperature fuel cells.', '© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang- ers [1–3]. Sulfonated polysulfone (PSF) [4], polyetheretherketone (PEEK) [5,6] and polybenzimidazoles (PBIs) [7–11] are among poly-mers which can be used as alternatives for Nafion in PEFCs.', 'Amongpolybenzimidazolederivatives,poly[2,2-5,5(m-phenylene)-bibenzimidazole](PBI),whichisalsocalled commercial polybenzimidazole have been used as a mem-brane material in PEMFCs. Having high chemical as well as thermal resistance and proton conductivity, polybenzimidazoles are great options to be used in the fuel cells with function at elevated temperatures above 100 ◦C [12].', 'PBIs should have enough proton conductivity so that it could be used as proton exchange membranes in the fuel cells. To achieve this purpose, they are usually doped with a sufficient acid like H3PO4 to an appropriate doping level [13]. Nanocomposite membranes are a new group of membranes which contain nanopar-ticles such as SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 and other compounds [14–21]. The introduction of nanoparticles into the membranes results in a considerable improvement in their features like mechani-cal properties, methanol permeability, but in some cases leads to a decrease in proton conductivity [22–24]. In order to over-come this problem, surface functionalized nanoparticles, which means various compounds with polar groups grafted chemically to the surface of the nanoparticles [25–28], were used. As men-tioned before, the numerous research works were done concerning grafting various compounds on the SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles which used for different purposes. However, in this work, we have used monomer bearing functional groups like imidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene which can improve the properties of pro-ton conductive membranes. These monomers are polymerized on the surface of the nanoparticles and as a consequence, they can more affect the properties of the membranes than while one functional group is grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. In addition, the polymerization of the selected monomers such as vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface of nanoparticle could cause more compatibility between nanopar-ticles and polymer matrix which finally improve the mechanical properties. In this work, nanocomposite membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles and newly synthesized polybenzimidazole was depicted poly[2,2-5,5-(m-pyrazolidene)-bibenzimidazole] (PPBI). Modification of the mentioned nanoparticles was performed by radical polymerization of some vinyl monomers such as sulfonated styrene and vinylim-idazole on the surface of the nanoparticles to which vinylic group was bounded covalently. Also, the effect of surface modification on the properties of the nanocomposite membranes such as pro-ton conductivity, mechanical properties and water uptake were studied.', '@', '@', '2.

The absence of absorbent peak related to amine group proton (N–H) in the area of 4.0–5.0 ppm and an absorbent related to amide group in the area of 10.3–10.6 ppm show the complete closure of imidazole rings during the polycondensation reaction.', 'In FT-IR characteristics of PPBI, the presence of absorbent bands in 800 cm−1 is related to the vibration of C–H bond of imida-zole, a band in about 1300 cm−1 is related to the vibration of C–N bond of imidazole, the absorbent band in 1450 cm−1 is related to C N and C C vibrations and bands in the area of 3400 cm−1 and 3140 cm−1 are related to N–H vibrations. All the above absorbent bands confirm the synthesis of PPBI.

The presence of the absorbent bands in 3050 cm−1 and 3100 cm−1 can be related to aromatic C–H bonds and also the existence of bands in the area of 2950 cm−1 can be attributed to aliphatic C–H bonds. Also the peaks in 1619 and 1419 cm−1 can be due to C C and C N bonds. In Fig. 4(c), the presence of the absorbent band in 1257 cm−1 is cor-responded to S O bond of the sulfonic acid group. These prove the existence of polymeric chains that are grafted onto the nanoparticle surface.', 'FT-IR spectra of the modified nanoparticles have been measured after complete washing and drying. To be sure of the chemical bonding of all chains (not physical) onto the particle surface, some un-modified nanoparticles were mixed with polymeric solutions of PVI and PSV and were stirred for 1 h. After filtration, the washing method used to wash the modified nanoparticles, was applied to the resulting powder as well. The FT-IR spectrum of the obtained powder did not show any absorbent bands related to PVI and PSV chains. The absorbent bands, which existed in the spectrum of mod-ified nanoparticles, were not observed in this spectrum. So, it was indicated that the polymeric chains have been attached to the par-ticles surface via covalent bonds.', '3.2. Thermal analysis', 'Thermogravimetric analysis diagrams of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 5. Weight loss in 85 ◦C can be related to the release of physically absorbed water. In un-modified nanoparticles, the minor weight loss in elevated temperatures can be attributed to the loss of hydroxyl groups of the particle surface attached by covalent bonds. Weight loss in modified nanoparticles could be a result of thermal degradation of the polymeric chains grafted to the surface of the nanoparti-cles. Also, the weight loss in 230–300 ◦C was due to the thermal decomposition of the sulfonate groups in the grafted PSV chains [30].', 'Thermograms of PVI modified nanocomposite with 5, 10 and 15% of TiO2 are shown in Fig. 6. As it is observed, the thermal prop-erties of the nanocomposites prepared with various amounts of TiO2 are almost similar. For this reason, in order to compare the thermal properties of other nanocomposites which prepared with modified nanoparticles having different monomers, only the TGA thermograms of nanocomposite containing of 10% (between 5% and 15%) modified nanoparticles are reported.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The remaining weight percentage in 850 ◦C is related to the modified TiO2 that is less than the added amount of PVI-modified TiO2 nanoparticles when the membrane was prepared. This decrease in weight in comparison with the theoretical amount could be related due to the degradation of the chains grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. Also, in order to obtain the par-ticular weight of the modified nanoparticles, specific amounts of modified and un-modified nanoparticles were weighed after and before complete burning out all the polymers. They were heated to temperatures about 1000 ◦C for 30 min and the obtained nanoparti-cles were weighed immediately. The difference between the weight of un-modified nanoparticles before and after heating shows the amount of lost water which was either physically absorbed or pro-duced from the condensation reaction of the hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticle surface. Also from the difference between the weight of modified nanoparticles before and after heating and consider- ing the weight of lost water, the percentage of the grafted polymer onto the nanoparticle surface was obtained. The obtained results and theoretical amounts are shown in Table 1. The amounts of the obtained results in all cases are more than theoretical values. This could be related to the presence of free water molecules and hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticles surface in which their values are not subtracted from theoretical values.', '@', '@', 'The diagrams of thermogravimetric analysis of both PPBI and nanocomposites prepared from the modified nanoparticles (10% w/w) are shown in Fig. 7. The weight loss observed in the tempera-ture range of 50–140 ◦C is a result of the release of water adsorbed into the membranes which is less significant in nanocomposites in comparison to pure membrane.', 'The second loss in weight, observed at the temperature range of 500–530 ◦C, is also attributed to the thermal degradation of poly-meric backbone of the nanocomposite membranes which is almost identical to the degradation temperature of pure PPBI. As a result, the addition of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles do not have any noticeable effect on thermal stability of the prepared nanocomposites.', 'As it is observed in Fig. 7, the degradation of PVI-modified nanoparticles occurs at 185 ◦C which is lower than the related tem-perature of PSV-modified ones. Therefore, the former one can be used in fuel cells with performance under 150 ◦C, but PSV-modified membrane is more suitable in high temperature fuel cells.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '3.3. Water uptake and doping level', 'Water uptake amount of nanocomposite membranes contain-ing 5, 10 and 15% of modified nanoparticles at 25 ◦C are shown in Fig. 8. Addition of silica nanoparticles to PPBI membranes increased their water uptakes due to the hygroscopic nature of SiO2 and TiO2nanoparticles. The sulfonic and imidazole groups in the nanopar-ticles increased the water uptake to a greater extent. The amount of water uptake for PPBI/TiO2-PSV, PPBI/SiO2-PSV, PPBI/TiO2-PVI and PPBI/SiO2-PVI are 21.6, 22.7, 20.4 and 21.9%, respectively. The effect of sulfonic acid groups of PSV chains grafted onto the nanoparticle surface on the water uptake is more than imidazole groups in PVI chains due to the higher hygroscopic properties of PSV comparing to PVI chains grafted on to the silica nanopar-ticle surface. The water uptake of PPBI/SiO2-PSV is higher than PPBI/TiO2-PSV which can be due to the further increase of the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles in comparison to TiO2 nanoparticle surface.', 'The PPBI-based membranes were doped with 85% H3PO4 to prepare the acid-doped membranes. Fig. 9 shows the acid-doping levels of the PPBI-based nanocomposite membranes. Acid-doping level (H3PO4 molecules per PPBI repeating unit) of pristine PPBI membrane was 13.5, which decreased to 11.8 for PPBI/SiO2, 12.0 for PPBI/SiO2-PSV, 11.7 for PPBI/TiO2 and 12.2 for PPBI/TiO2-PSV with 10% nanoparticle content and increased to 15.8 for PPBI/SiO2-PVI and 15.2 for PPBI/TiO2-PVI. Some of the amino groups in PPBI chains were blocked with the sulfonic acid groups of TiO2-PSV and SiO2-PSV, to decrease the binding ability of PPBI chains to H3PO4molecules.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Among the prepared nanocomposites, the water uptake in PPBI/SiO2-PSV and acid doping in PPBI/SiO2-PVI were the most one. Even in the comparison of these membranes with the simi-lar ones which prepared from modified TiO2 such as PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, the amount of water uptake and doping level were higher. This shows that using modified SiO2 nanoparticles in fuel cells is more appropriate.', '3.4. Proton conductivity', 'The membrane was sandwiched between two stainless steel electrodes and pressed together by clamp. Then, the MEA (Mem-brane Electrolyte Assembly) was inputted in the steam autoclave equipped with temperature controller. For measurement of pro-ton conductivity, the steam autoclave supplied with steam from a house generator for exposure to saturated steam at desired temperature. As an example, for saturated steam the pressure cor-responding to 120 ◦C is 205 kPa. The time of exposure to saturated steam at 120 ◦C was 30 min that this value for temperature of 140 ◦C was increased to 50 min.', 'Fig. 10 shows the Nyquist plot and equivalent circuit of studied membranes at 25 ◦C and RH 100% for some membranes.', 'After fitting the EIS experimental data on the electrical equiv-alent circuit, the membrane proton conductivity was determined from the intercept of EIS data with real impedance Z′ axis (as the value of Rm element). In equivalent circuit, Rm presents the resis-tance of the polymer film between the two metallic electrodes toward charge carriers (i.e. H+). L1 presents the stray inductance of the setup wires. CPE1 presents the non-ideal double layer capac-itance of the film/metal electrode interface. Rct and W0 show the charge transfer resistance of the (possible) reactions at the film/metal electrode interface and the diffusion processes through the polymers film, respectively. The proton conductivities of the phosphoric acid-doped PPBI based nanocomposite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 11) at 100% relative humidity were presented as a function of temperatures up to 80 ◦C. The pro-ton conductivities of all membranes increased with increasing the operation temperature up to 80 ◦C. Addition of the un-modified nanoparticles showed a negative effect on the proton conductivities of nanocomposite membranes. Similar trends were also reported to other nanocomposite membranes like Nafion®/silica membranes and PBI/silica membranes [31].', '@', '@', 'On the other hand, comparing the pristine PPBI and Nafion®117 membranes, the relatively high proton conductivities of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles are noteworthy [32]. Li et al. have used sulfonated organosilica to modify Nafion® membranes and they found that the proton con-ductivities of the modified membranes were still lower than that of the neat Nafion® membrane.', 'The reduction in the proton conductivity was attributed to the silica-induced changes in the tortuous paths and in the dis-tribution of hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains. However, in this work an enhancing effect on the proton conductivity was observed with addition of PSV and PVI grafted nanoparticles to PPBI mem-brane. The sulfonic and imidazole groups of modified nanoparticles also contribute in the acid-doping effect to PPBI polymer so as to enhance the proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles. Moreover, the presence of modified nanoparticles induces proton conductive pathways lead-ing to an increase in the proton conductivities of PPBI/modified nanoparticles membranes [24].', 'The proton conductivities of the acid-doped nanocompos-ite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 12) were further studied at high temperatures under an anhydrous environment. All the PPBI/modified nanoparticle membranes still exhibited higher proton conductivities than the pristine acid-doped PPBI membrane.', '@', '@', 'Generally, two principle mechanisms of vehicle mechanism and Grotthuss mechanism (hopping) describe proton diffusion through the membrane [33]. It is possible that the bounded water par-ticipates by the Grotthuss mechanism, and the free water takes part mostly by vehicle mechanism [34]. Addition of silica-SO3H to the membranes increases the bounded water content in the membranes (Fig. 13). The bounded water facilitates the proton transport ability through the Grotthuss mechanism, originating by generation of a continuous proton conductive pathway. There-fore, the high proton conductivity of PPBI/modified nanoparticles can be attributed to the high bounded water content in the membrane.', 'Since the Grotthuss-type diffusion mechanism without assis-tance of the vehicle mechanism has been proposed for the protonconductionunderanhydrousenvironments[35,36], theprotonconductivityoftheacid-dopedPPBI/modified nanoparticlemembranescouldbesynergisticallyresulted from their modified nanoparticle contents and the acid-doping levels.', 'Consequently, the highest proton conductivity was obtained withtheacid-dopedPPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%membraneathigh humidity and low temperatures and PPBI/SiO2-PVI-15% mem-brane in high temperatures and low humidity, which possesses the moderate modified nanoparticles content and acid-doping level.', 'As it is seen in Fig. 9, either we use PSV-modified or un-modified nanoparticles, the increase in the amount of the nanoparticles leads to a decrease in the acid doping level, but when PVI-modified nanoparticles were used, doping level increased. Also, according to Fig. 8, water uptake of the membrane shows an increase when using higher amounts of modified nanoparticles. This increase in PSV-modified nanocomposite membranesishigherinPVI-modified one. Proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PSV-modified nanoparticles shows significant increase in comparison to PVI-modified ones in low temperature and high rel-ative humidity. But in high temperature and low relative humidity, proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PVI-modified nanoparticles is observed to be more than PSV-modified ones and even at 145 ◦C the proton conductivity of PPBI/SiO2-PVI 15% is more than PPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%. The exis-tence of modified nanoparticles in PPBI nanocomposite membranes results in high proton conductivity in three ways:', '@', '@', '1) With increase in water uptake 2) With increase in the amount of doping level and 3) With increase in the number of proton conductive functional groups such as sulfonic acid group.', 'In PSV-modified nanocomposite membranes, acid doping decreases while the water uptake and the number of sulfonic acid groups shows an increase. Consequently, high proton conductiv-ity can be a result of these changes. It should be mentioned that in temperatures higher than 100 ◦C and in very low relative humidity, water uptake of PSV-modified membranes decreases which leads to low efficiency of the sulfonic groups attached onto the surface of the nanoparticles which in turn results in a decrease in proton conduc-tivity in both membranes, but the increase in proton conductivity resulting from high doping level is significant and also the proton conductivity of PVI-modified nanocomposite membranes increase in high temperatures.', 'It is noteworthy that Nafion® 117 shows relatively low pro-ton conductivities under anhydrous conditions and almost lacks its proton conductivities at high temperatures. Comparing to Nafion®117 membranes, the high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicate that this membrane could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', '3.5. Mechanical properties', 'The mechanical properties of the PPBI-based membranes were measured. The stress–strain curves are shown in Fig. 14. Pristine PPBI membrane showed an elongation at break of 38%. Mod-ification of nanocomposites with SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles results in an increase in the tensile strengths and a subse-quent decrease in the elongations at break for the PPBI-based membranes. For PPBI/modified nanoparticles nanocomposites membranes (PPBI/modified nanocomposite consists of the PPBI and surface-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles by PVI and PSV chains and PPBI/unmodified nanocomposite includes PPBI and SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles without any treatment), the presence of ionic linkages between PPBI and silica particles can be assigned to their high Young’s modulus. Introduction of modified and un-modified nanoparticles increases the brittleness of the nanocomposite mem-branes with a decrease in their elongations at break. The effects of modified and unmodified nanoparticles on the elongations at break of the nanocomposite membranes were different. The decrease in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness were widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inorganic reinforcement [37–39]. Moreover, the ionic linkages in nanocomposite membranes prepared from modi-fied nanoparticles are higher than hydrogen bonding in PPBI/SiO2and PPBI/TiO2.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The brittleness of PPBI/TiO2 based nanocomposite membranes is higher than PPBI/SiO2 ones. The brittleness of membranes pre-pared from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI are less than PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV membranes which are perhaps due to more com-patibility of PVI grafted chains onto the nanoparticles surface with PPBI backbone.', 'Comparing the brittleness of the nanocomposite membranes of the PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/SiO2-PVI with PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, respectively indicates that the brittleness of the membranes prepared with modified SiO2 nanoparticles is less than the modified TiO2 ones.', '3.6. Morphological analysis', 'The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photographs of the PPBI/TiO2-PSV nanocomposite membranes surface with various amounts of TiO2-PSV are shown in Fig. 15.', 'A relatively flat surface is observed for thin membranes of pure PPBI (Fig. 15(a)). Fig. 15(b–d) display surface morphological properties of nanocomposite membranes having 5, 10 and 15% of TiO2-PSV, respectively.', 'As seen in Fig. 15, TiO2-PSV nanoparticles are dispersed homo-geneously in PPBI matrixes and are increased with increasing of the percentage of TiO2-PSV nanoparticles. Also the major amounts of nanoparticles size are in the range of nanoscale and the bigger parti-cles as evidence for the formation of aggregations are not observed. The size of the TiO2-PSV particles are about 25–40 nm and the size of particles on the surface of the nanocomposite are determined to be 30–60 nm.', 'Fig. 16(a) shows the SEM micrographs of the modified SiO2nanoparticles. If the interactions between silica nanoparticles are stronger than that of between PPBI molecules and silica nanoparticles, the silica nanoparticles are agglomerated together to form silica domains in micrometer sizes. The compatibility between PPBI and unmodified nanoparticles and the homogene-ity of the PPBI/SiO2 or PPBI/TiO2 membranes are somewhat poor [32].', 'However, the dispersion homogeneity of silica nanoparticles in PPBI membranes could be significantly improved with using surface modified nanoparticles as the additives. As shown in Fig. 16(b), the dispersion homogeneity of modified nanoparticles is observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2 nanocomposite membrane, which demonstrates high compatibility between PPBI polymer and PSV-SiO2 nanoparticles and the high dispersion abil-ity of PSV-SiO2 in PPBI matrix. Particle agglomeration is still not observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2-10%. The ionic linkages between PPBI and modified nanoparticles are contributed to their higher compatibility [32]. However, in nanocompos-ite membranes prepared from un-modified SiO2 nanoparticles, thedispersionofthenanoparticlesinpolymermatrixis not homogenous and probably aggregation has been formed (Fig. 16(c)).', '@', '@', '4. Conclusion', 'The nanocomposite PPBI-based membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified and un-modified TiO2 and SiO2nanoparticles. The thermal stability of the prepared nanocompos- ite membranes was similar to PPBI membrane. The water uptake of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from TiO2/PSV and SiO2/PSV nanoparticles were higher than other nanocomposite membranes. The acid doping level and proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes in dry conditions obtained from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI nanoparticles were the highest in comparison to PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV. Formation of nanocomposites with modified and un-modified nanoparticles resulted the increas-ing of tensile strengths. The decreasing in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness was widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inor-ganic reinforcement. The high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicated that this membrane could be utilized as a proton exchange membrane for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. M.-G.

2025-05-12 23:23:51 - WARNING: ['Synthesis of periodic polyolefins based on anionic alternating copolymerization†', 'Hong Yan, Hongyuan Bai, Xuefei Wang, Haitao Leng, Siwei Chen, Li Hanand Hongwei Ma*', 'To avoid sequence bias in the chain growth process of multicomponent periodic polymers, we reportedan indirect method for the synthesis of strictly periodic polymers using nonpolar monomers. Using 1,1-diphenylethylene (DPE) as the comonomer, the precise sequence was achieved through living anionic polymerization (LAP) and hydrogenation. Four dienes (isoprene (Ip), 2,3-dimethylbuta-1,3-diene (DMBD),2,3-diphenylbutadiene-1,3-diene (DPB), and 1-phenyl-1,3-butadiene (1-PB)) and an olefin with cyclictension 1-cyclobutylvinylbenzene (CBVB) were copolymerized with DPE to prepare the alternating pre-cursors. The periodic sequences of DPE–styrene–propylene (pd-DSP), DPE–propylene–propylene (pd-DPP), DPE–ethylene–styrene (pd-DES), DPE–styrene–styrene (pd-DSS) and DPE–ethylene–styrene–styrene (pd-DESS) were successfully synthesized with hydrogenation of these alternating precursors, and the nonpolar olefin units were successfully introduced into the periodic polymer. The results showed thatthe modification of the backbone carbon framework structure caused a consistent change in the thermalproperties of the polymers. Moreover, the steric hindrance and arrangement density of the side chain substituents could significantly affect the performance of the periodic copolymers. This study provides afeasible method for the synthesis of non-polar periodic copolymers with precise periodic arrangements.', 'Introduction', 'The sequence structure of polymers forms the basis for the expression of their properties.1–3 Among various sequences, periodicpolymersare composed ofmultiplemonomers arranged in a regular pattern, as well as the side chain groups.4–6 Therefore, compared with other sequences such as random, block, or gradient distributions, the ordered structure of periodic polymers can better guide the folding and assem-bly of the polymer chains. They exhibit wide applicability in emerging fields such as drug delivery, battery storage and optical components.7–10 Various types of periodic polymers often have defective structures, because it is difficult for mul-tiple types of monomers to undergo strict crossover reactions according to the preset requirements.11 Therefore, only in the polymerization of two monomers, alternating sequences can beobtainedbysuppressingthehomo-propagation reactions.12–14Constructingalternatingsequencesisan effective method to obtain precise periodic sequences.', 'Step-growth polymerization employs efficient orthogonal reactions between the functional groups to achieve precise and strict sequences, which can prevent the formation of defective structures; click reactions and multicomponent reactions are widely used in the construction of alternating structures. For example, the Ugi, CuAAC and Passerini reactions have been used to synthesize complex periodic sequences such as [ABCB], [ABCBA] and [ABCDCB].15–18 However, step-growth polymerization can only yield precise sequences of oligomers. Furthermore, in the preparation of high molecular weight peri-odic copolymers, combining step-growth polymerization and chain-growth polymerization is more promising and challen-ging. For example, current research has achieved the synthesis of periodic copolymers possessing [ABC], [ABBA], and [ABBCD] repeating structures by the combination of reversible-de-activationradicalpolymerizations(RDRPs)andcoupling reactions.19–22 In addition, radical coupling reactions (RACPs) have also been reported to prepare periodic copolymers with [ABC], [ABAC], and [ABCC] repeating structures.23,24 The above methods are capable of obtaining relatively precise periodic structures that require a combination of multiple mechanisms and rely on the special functional groups of monomers. For non-polar polymers, none of the above methods are appli-cable. Living ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) is an extremely efficient synthesis strategy to produce periodic non-polar polymers. Based on the information from periodic sequences, it is necessary to design and construct the required macrocyclicolefinsandthenobtainperiodicsequences through ring opening metathesis polymerization of mono-mers, such as the periodic sequences of styrene, ethylene, or propylene.25–27 Based on this theoretical foundation, our research group developed a new method for carbon skeleton regulation in previous studies. The styrene derivatives with cyclic substituents underwent anion-migrated ring-opening polymerization, followed by hydrogenation, and we success-fully synthesized polymers with pd-SEM and pd-SEE periodic sequence structures.28 This method was able to achieve the goal of obtaining strictly precise periodic sequences through chain polymerization.', 'Inspired by this work, apart from homopolymers, only alter-nating polymers can also achieve strict sequence control by chainpolymerization.Assumingthatmultiplenonpolar olefins are directly copolymerized through chain growth to obtain periodic structures, the insertion of monomer units is determined by the reactivity ratio, which is controlled by temp-erature and solvent;29–32 thus, perfect periodic insertion is impossible. Furthermore, owing to the influence of dynamics, the precision of the sequence sharply decreases during the polymerization process until the sequence structure becomes statistically random. However, in various types of copolymer sequence control, only alternating sequences can be strictly achieved; perfect alternation will occur when both r1 and r2 are equal to zero, or when r1r2 = 0, alternating sequences can also be obtained. Therefore, the problem of statistical randomness can be avoided by synthesizing a strict alternating structure andfunctionalizingthisstructuretoobtainaperiodic structure.33', 'This process provides an indirect method to obtain strictly periodic structures through chain growth aggregation. Among the various methods for synthesizing alternating copolymers, living anionic polymerization can precisely control the mole-cular weight of polymers, with no termination or chain trans-fer during the active chain growth process.34–36 It is difficult to homopolymerize DPE and its derivatives because of steric hin-drance. However, owing to the P–π conjugated structure formed between the two benzene rings and the vinyl group in the monomer, DPE can easily copolymerize with other nonpo-lar olefins. During the process of LAP, the formation of DPE terminal active centers can only lead to alternating cross-growth with comonomers.37,38 Therefore, DPE and various nonpolar olefins can be utilized to synthesize polymers with strictly alternating structures. In this study, four different dienes and a special olefin capable of undergoing a ring-opening reaction were selected for copolymerization with DPE, andfivenewalternatingcopolymersweresuccessfully obtained by adjusting the reaction conditions. All copolymers had carbon–carbon double bonds incorporated into their polymer backbones. After simple hydrogenation treatment, five multiblock structured polymers, namely, pd-DSP, pd-DPP, pd-DES, pd-DSS and pd-DESS, were obtained. By comparing the performance of alternating sequence copolymers and peri-odic sequence copolymers with the 10 different sequence structures mentioned above, the intricate relationship between the polymer structure and performance could be further eluci- dated. Furthermore, the results from this study indicated that LAP could not only yield fully alternating sequence polymers but also indirectly produce polymers with strictly periodic structures. This method provides a new approach for synthe-sizingmultiperiodicstructuredpolymerswithprecise sequences. Consequently, developing strategies for synthesiz-ing precisely periodic polymers is highly challenging and valu-able; this exploration has the potential to enrich the types of periodic sequences and obtain polyolefin materials with better mechanical properties.', 'Results and discussion', 'Polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) are the most widely used general-purpose plastics in the world, and ethylene-co-propylene also has many potential applications. By utilizing a Ziegler–Natta catalyst to catalyze the trans-1,4-polymerization of Ip and hydrogenation, a precise sequence of ethylene-alt-propylene (alt-EP) can be synthesized.39 This type of alternat-ing polymer was obtained through the complex coordination polymerization of a single monomer and severely compro-mised the ability to regulate the carbon skeleton of the poly-mers. Based on the above alt-EP, we introduced other ethylene monomers to copolymerize with Ip to form a fully alternating sequencecopolymer;then,acarbon-richmultiperiodic polymer can be obtained in the same manner after hydrogen-ation. DPE has inherent advantages in the synthesis of alter-nating copolymers by LAP (rD = 0); thus, periodic polymers of DPE–ethylene–propylene (pd-DEP) can be obtained by control-ling the alternation sequence of DPE and Ip. For nonpolar polyolefins, the performance of the copolymer relies more on the arrangement of short branches (methyl) or side groups (phenyl rings) along the main polymer chain when the carbon skeleton structures are similar. Therefore, three types of peri-odic sequences (DPE–propylene–propylene (DPP), DPE–ethyl-ene–ethylene–St (DEES) and DPE–St–St (DSS)) can be obtained by introducing substituted dienes (DMBD, 1-PB, and DPB). The above four types of periodic polymers have a C6 carbon skeleton. Apart from the arrangement of monomer units, the carbon skeleton length affects the properties of polymers. ROMP is an effective method for preparing long carbon skel-etons. Based on this theory, our research group has proposed the AMROP method, which produces a periodic polymer with a C8 backbone structure like DPE–St–ethylene–ethylene (DSEE) (Scheme 1).40', 'The strategy of this study is to obtain strict periodic sequences by using strict alternating polymers; thus, the first step is to regulate DPE and various dienes to form strict alter-nating copolymers. For nonpolar monomers, r1r2 = 0 is a rigid requirement for the synthesis of alternating copolymers; in LAP, the main way of controlling sequences is to alter the reac-tivity ratios of the monomers. The four main pathways are as follows: (1) by adjusting the feeding strategy, the copolymer sequence structure can be changed. Yuki et al. investigated the reaction characteristics of DPE and St in nonpolar solvents during anionic polymerization, and reactivity ratios could be calculated based on the monomer feed ratio and the pro-portion of monomer units in the polymer. (2) The addition of a modifier can effectively promote dynamic propagation and regulate the copolymerization behavior of the monomers. For example, alkoxide metal modifiers can form a special four-mem-bered ring transition state structure with an active center, and the two coexisting counterions can isomerize with each other, thereby altering the rate of crossover propagation. (3) The sol-vation ability and polarity of the solvent directly influence the morphology of the active center, can alter the closeness of the ion pairs and thus affect the reactivity ratios of the monomers. For example, when DPE and Ip are copolymerized in benzene, r2 can reach a maximum of 37, but when they are copolymerized in THF, r2 decreases to 0.11. (4) Temperature affects mainly the reac-tivity ratios of the monomers by affecting the rate constant of crossover propagation. Generally, anionic polymerization occurs at temperatures ranging from −20 °C to 100 °C.41–46 Based on the various regulation methods mentioned above, DPE can be copolymerized with Ip, DMBD, 1-PB, and DPB to obtain strictly alternating polymers. The specific copolymerization process is described in ESI Table S1.†', '@', '@', 'The methyl groups of DMBD serve as electron-donating substituents, not only increasing its steric hindrance but also reducing its reactivity in nucleophilic reactions. As described in Yuki’s report, even if DMBD (M2) and DPE (M1) were copoly-merized in benzene, r2 was only 0.23. For low-reactivity olefins, the polymer structure could be controlled to form alternating sequences by employing a feed strategy. Through the corres-ponding analysis of proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) data (see ESI Fig. S7† and Table 1), the M1/M2 value of DPE and DMBD increased from 1 to 4; this resulted in an increase in the con-version rate of DPE from 69.98% to 88.68% (Covn.M1(%) = Covn.M2(%)/(N2/N1)) and the NDMBD/ND value could reach 1.09 (as calculated via ESI eqn (S7)†). Based on the above results, its structure can be preliminarily identified as an alternating sequence. The obtained polymer had a narrow distribution and a molecular weight close to the predicted value. The con-version rate of DMBD reached 96.66%, indicating that no side reactions occurred during the copolymerization (see Table 1). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) is a direct method for deter-mining the alternating sequence. As shown in Fig. 1(b), using DPE-alt-DMBD as an example, the MALDI-TOF-MS result showed a unique series of proton peaks. The m/z peak at 2967.39 (see ESI Fig. S17†) could be attributed to 10 units of DPE (10 × 180.09 u) + 11 units of DMBD (11 × 68.12 u) + a hydrogen terminal group (1.01 u) + a counterion Ag (106.91 u) + a sec-butyl-terminal group (57.07 u). The difference in the numerical values between each peak consisted of one DPE unit and one DMBD unit.', 'However, for highly active dienes, simply increasing the feeding of DPE not only fails to obtain alternating sequences, but also causes waste of resources. The reactivity ratios of DPE and Ip(M2) are strongly influenced by the solvent, with r2', '@', '@', 'a Mn (SEC) and PDI values for the copolymers were determined using SEC with polystyrene (PS) as a standard. b Ratio of N2/N1 units in the chaincalculated by 1H NMR (N1 represents the number of DPE in the chains and N2 represents the number of dienes in the chains).

Therefore, DPE and IP should be copolymerized in THF (run 1), and their corresponding 1H NMR spectra and MALDI-TOF-MS result are presented in ESI Fig. S6 and S16† (calculated using ESI eqn (S6)†). The polymerization con-ditions of DPE-alt-1-PB and DPE-alt-DPB can be understood by analyzing and comparing the structures of Ip and DMBD, as well as their polymerization conditions. The reaction activity of conjugated dienes is determined by both the conjugation effect and steric hindrance. The 1-position carbon of 1-PB con-tains a phenyl ring substituent, and the presence of this elec-tron-withdrawing group reduces the electron cloud density on the double bond; this is advantageous for the attack of the carbon anions, and therefore, the reactivity of 1-PB is greater than that of Ip. DPB contains two phenyl ring substituents; these substituents reduce the electron cloud density and increase the steric hindrance. Therefore, its reactivity is greater than that of DMBD but lower than that of Ip. Both DPE-alt-1-PB and DPE-alt-DPB can be obtained in THF (runs 5 and 6). The corresponding analyses of the 1H NMR spectra and the MALDI-TOF-MS result are presented in ESI Fig. S8, S9 and S18, S19,† calculated using ESI eqn (S8) and (S9).†', 'The sequence regulation in the copolymers obtained by LAP is controlled by their kinetic behavior. In the preliminary stage, our research group has investigated the copolymeriza-tion reaction characteristics of DPE and CPVB. At room temp-erature, the self-growth kinetic constants of both DPE and CPVB are zero (KCP = 0 and KDD = 0 at 25 °C). Therefore, a new polymerization mechanism, AMROP, is proposed to explain the ideal alternating copolymerization process of CPVB and DPE derivatives. The proposed AMROP provides more possibi-lities for controlling the carbon framework of vinyl monomer polymers; thus, we have shifted our focus to CBVB, which is a styrene derivative with different ring substituents from CPVB. Previously, studies have reported that CBVB can homopolymer-ize through AMROP; its cyclobutyl can be opened and formed into a C5 skeleton polymer by increasing the temperature; the pd-SEE periodic polymer can be obtained after hydrogenation. In the same way, the self-growth kinetic constants of both DPE and CBVB are zero (KCB = 0 and KDD = 0 at 25 °C). Therefore, DPE and CBVB can likely undergo cross-growth at room temp-erature by AMROP and yield a quaternary periodic polymer structure of pd-DSEE. Theoretically, CBVB-alt-DPE can be obtained with a 1 : 1 feed ratio at room temperature. The intra-molecular bond angle of the cyclopropyl three-membered ring in CPVB is 60°, and the hydrogen atoms on the ring are in overlapping positions; these hydrogen atoms can easily create tensionandthereforefacilitatering-openingreactions. However, the intramolecular angle of the cyclobutyl group in CBVB is 90°, resulting in lower ring tension than that of the ternary ring. Therefore, the polymerization reaction rate of DPE and CBVB is slightly lower. With the same design, the conversion rate of CBVB increased from 46% to 84% by extend-ing the polymerization time from 5 days (run 7) to 10 days (run 8), and the molecular weight of the copolymers also doubled. Based on 1H NMR spectrum characterization (ESI Fig. S10†), regardless of whether the conversion rate of CBVB was high or low, the ND/NB value was close to 1; these results confirmed that DPE-alt-CBVB was successfully synthesized. Here, we tested the MALDI-TOF-MS data of low-molecular-weight (run 7) and high-molecular-weight (run 8) polymers, and several series of proton peaks appeared in the spectra. As shown in Fig. 1(e), the peak with an m/z of 2374.28 corresponded to 7 units of DPE (7 × 180.09 u) repeat units +6 units of CBVB (6 × 158.11 u) repeat units + a hydrogen terminal group (1.01 u) + a counterion Ag (106.91 u) + a sec-butyl-terminal group (57.07 u) (ESI Fig. S20†). Similarly, based on the analysis of the data in ESI Fig. S21,† the polymerization time was prolonged, and DPE and CBVB still grew alternately.', 'In conjugated dienes, the mobility of the double bond elec-tron cloud is high, and it is easy to induce polarization. When the density of the π electron cloud on the carbon–carbon doublebonddecreases,theslightlypositivelycharged β-carbon atom is conducive to the attack of the negatively charged anionic active center, causing π-electron heterolysis and initiating anionic polymerization. During the addition reaction of the conjugated dienes with nucleophilic reagents, both 3,4-addition and 1,4-addition can occur. In the case of 1,4-addition, unsaturated double bonds are formed in the polymer skeleton, thereby forming a cis/trans structure. When DPE is copolymerized with Ip, DMBD, 1-PB and DPB, the diole-fins need to be copolymerized with DPE by 1,4-addition to obtain long carbon chain structures. In the polymerization of DPE and Ip, DPE is preferentially triggered by sec-BuLi to form DPE-Li; DPE-Li initially attacks the carbon at the 4-position with less steric hindrance, forming an active center at the carbon at the 1-position with the least steric hindrance. Therefore, the next DPE is added to the carbon at the 1-posi-tion during the alternating copolymerization. As a result, mainly 1,4-structures are formed, with few 3,4-structures pro-duced and almost no formation of a 1,2-structure. Therefore, the 1,2-structures and 3,4-structures were disregarded in the subsequent description of the polymer structure. In the carbonpolymerbackbonestructureoftheDPE-alt-1-PB polymer, 3% 1,2-structures can be clearly observed via 1H NMR (ESI Fig. S8,† δ = 5.7–6.2 (ppm)). However, due to its low content, subsequent discussions are focused only on the 1-PB appearing in the polymer with 1,4-structures. Therefore, the polymer backbones can still ensure the rigor of their periodic structure after hydrogenation. Both DMBD and DPB have sub-stituents at the 2-position carbon and 3-position carbon. DMBD contains two methyl groups, which are electron-donat-ing substituents despite their relatively small steric hindrance. On the other hand, DPB has two phenyl rings as substituents, which are electron-withdrawing groups with significant steric hindrance. Together, these factors caused DMBD and DPB to undergo 1,4-addition to the polymer chain. The1H NMR spectra (ESI Fig. S7 and S9†) also revealed that the unsaturated double bond regions of DPE-alt-DMBD and DPE-alt-DPB had no peaks (δ = 4.0–6.0 (ppm)), showing the absence of a 1,2-structure in the polymer chain. The above results indicated that all five alternating polymers were successfully synthesized according to the proposed structure. A comparison of DPE-alt-Ip and DPE-alt-DMBD revealed that the carbon skeletons of the polymer backbones had the exact same arrangement, but the side chain of DPE-alt-DMBD contained an additional methyl group. When the two polymers had similar molecular weights, the Tg of DPE-alt-DMBD was 16 °C higher. Similarly, DPE-alt-DMBD and DPE-alt-DPB only differed in the size of the side group substitution, and Tg increased by 36 °C. A compari-son of the data revealed that the Tg values of DPE-alt-1-PB and DPE-alt-Ip exhibited unexpected trends. Typically, polymers with a benzene ring as the side group had a greater Tg than those with only a single methyl group. However, in this case, the absence of any substituents on the double bonds in the chain of DPE-alt-1-PB enabled increased bond rotation, result-ing in a Tg for DPE-alt-Ip that was 36 °C higher than expected. Therefore, the thermal properties of nonpolar olefin copoly-mers could be controlled by altering the number of substitu-ents, steric hindrance, and position. The polymer backbones of the five alternating structure polymers all contained double bonds. These double bonds could be used for simple hydro-genation modification to obtain the most basic periodic poly-mers and for more complex substitution and addition reac-tions to produce polymers with different side groups, thus endowing the polymer with a periodic arrangement of the functional groups (Scheme 2).', 'For common nonpolar olefins, controlling the copolymer sequence is often difficult (r1r2 > 0). In our previous work, AMROP was used to develop a new method for regulating the carbon skeleton. After hydrogenation, we successfully obtained strictly periodic polymers of pd-SE, pd-SEM and pd-SEE. Based on the research results, we introduced the special vinyl monomer DPE into the polymer backbone. This not only expanded the carbon skeleton length of the periodic structure and enriched the periodic carbon chain structure, but also increased the richness and feasibility of the design of previous alternating copolymers. The alternating copolymers obtained by LAP in the early stage needed to be hydrogenated to obtain novel periodic polymers. The specific hydrogenation process is described in the ESI.† In this way, five new periodic polymers, pd-DEP, pd-DES, pd-DSEE, pd-DPP and pd-DSS, were obtained.', 'DPE-alt-IP, DPE-alt-1-PB and DPE-alt-CBVB showed signifi-cant changes in the unsaturated region of the 1H NMR spectra before and after hydrogenation because of the double bond of their polymer backbones. Hence, the hydrogenation degree of each hydrogenated product could be directly calculated based on the integral of the hydrogen spectrum (ESI eqn (S13-2), (S14) and (S15)†). The structure of the hydrogenated polymer was characterized by DEPT-135°-13C NMR and 13C NMR (ESI Fig. S13–S15†). The unsaturated carbon peaks of DPE-alt-IP at δ = 130.0–132.0 ppm, DPE-alt-1-PB at δ = 132.0–140.0 ppm and DPE-alt-CBVB at δ = 130.0–137.0 ppm all disappeared; these results further confirmed that the degree of hydrogenation was high. The degree of hydrogenation for the above three struc-tures is shown in Fig. 2. Moreover, it can also explain the acquisition of a strictly periodic structure.', '@', '@', 'However, no change was observed in the unsaturated hydro-gen in the 1H NMR spectra of DPE-alt-DMBD and DPE-alt-DPB before and after hydrogenation. Therefore, the degree of hydro-genation of the polymers could only be analyzed using inverse-gated carbon IG-13C NMR (Fig. 3). Since the NDMBD/NDPE ratio was 1.09, the number of unsaturated seasonal carbons on the DPE structural unit in the polymer chain remained unchanged after hydrogenation (δ = 148.1–148.7 ppm). Using these data as a reference, the degree of hydrogenation could be calculated based on the change in the unsaturated seasonal carbon content of the DMBD structural units. After characterization by IG-13C NMR and the integration of the spectrum, less than 27% of the double bonds in the chain were not hydrogenated. The specific calculations can be found in ESI eqn (S11-1).† The inefficient hydrogenation was caused by the presence of two methyl substituents adjacent to the double bond in the DMBD unit, which affected the hydrogenation efficiency. Similarly, in DPE-alt-DPB, NDPE/NDPB = 1.12. Notably, the number of qua-ternary carbons on the phenyl rings of DPB remained unchanged after hydrogenation in alternating polymer chains (see Fig. 3, δ = 124.5–129.5 ppm). IG-13C NMR was also used to calculate the unsaturation of the polymer chain. Integral calcu-lations revealed that the degree of hydrogenation of the alter-nating copolymer was greater than 87% (ESI equation (S12- 1)†). Furthermore, the degree of hydrogenation could also be determined by analyzing the ratio of unsaturated carbons on the benzene ring using the DPE unit and the DPB unit. (ESI equation (S12-2)†).', 'Therefore, based on the above experimental results, the use of anionic polymerization and simple post-functionalization successfullyproducedaperiodicpolymerwithastrict sequence arrangement. These periodic sequences contained structures such as ethylene and propylene, which were difficult to obtain using traditional aggregation methods. Nonpolar monomers such as ethylene, propylene, and styrene could not be obtained through LAP with controlled molecular weights and narrow distributions. However, the copolymerization of nonpolar monomers could also yield unique and exceptional properties in the resulting rubber. In this study, DPE-alt-IP and DPE-alt-DMBD polymers were successfully functionalized, and copolymer sequences of ethylene and propylene were easily introduced into the polymer chains. The addition of 1-PB and CBVB introduced copolymer sequences of ethylene and styrene. As the polymer sequence changed from an alter-nating structure to a periodic structure, Tg significantly decreasedcomparedwiththatofthenon-hydrogenated polymer. Tg is an important factor that indirectly affects the flexibility of polymer chains. Generally, the independent double bonds in the polymer backbone increase the flexibility of polymer chains and reduce the glass transition temperature. However, all five sets of data in this study revealed that satur-ation of the double bond in the polymer backbone led to a lowerglasstransitiontemperatureofthepolymer(ESI Fig. S22†). This result occurred because the rotation of the carbon–carbon single bond improved the mobility of the polymer chain, which led to a decrease in the glass transition temperature of the polymer (see Scheme 3a and Table 2). Compared with pd-DPP, when the degree of polymerization was similar and when the arrangement density of the methyl substituents in the periodic structure increased (pd-DEP), the friction between the chain ends increased and the Tg of the periodic polymer increased by 26 °C (see Scheme 3b-1).', '@', '@', '@', '@ However, compared with pd-DPP, when the methyl substituent in the periodic structure became a benzene ring, the steric re-sistance between the structural units became greater, resulting in more difficult chain segment movement. Therefore, the Tg of the periodic polymer changed from 117 °C to 133 °C (see Scheme 3b-2). By comparison, pd-DSS and pd-DPP not only had simple periodic arrangement structures but also extended the arrangement of the periodic structure. PDPPDP and SDSSDS are “head–tail” structures. PDPPDP is the equivalent of inserting a second monomer into two propylene monomers. This is a new polymer structure and can be used as a template polymer to provide a reference for the synthesis of more precise positioning sequence polymers. SDSSDS is equivalent to adding a monomer to two styrene monomer units; this structure is difficult to produce using general copolymerization. On compar-ing SDSSDS with the work of Knoll and coworkers from the BASF on “super-polystyrene”,47 it was a pleasant surprise to find that the Tg of DPE-alt-DPB (161 °C) in this work is very close to that of St-alt-DPE in the aforementioned reference; it was also found that the Tg (133 °C) of pd-DSS is very similar to that of the St/DPE copolymer containing 35% DPE in “super-polystyrene”. The com-parison of this data also proves that the relationship between the polymer structure and the thermal properties can be designed and predicted. In addition, the length of the polymer carbon skeleton also affects the thermal performance. pd-DES and pd-DSEE have C6 and C8 skeleton structures, respectively, with the same types of structural units in the polymer backbones. An increase in the length of the periodic sequence enhances the flexibility of the chain, leading to a significant decrease in the Tg (see Scheme 3b-3).', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'a Determined by SEC using PS as a standard. b Glass transition temperature. c The degree of hydrogenation was calculated using ESI eqn (S11-1)–(S11-3), (S12-1), (S12-2), (S13-1), (S13-2), (S14) and (S15).†', 'Conclusion', 'The focus of this study was on the synthesis of periodic poly-mers with precise sequences. Through the synthesis of alter-nating copolymers, periodic polymers with five new structures, including pd-DEP, pd-DES, pd-DSEE, pd-DPP and pd-DSS, were obtained through hydrogenation. In the synthesis of alternat-ing copolymers, DPE-alt-IP, DPE-alt-DMBD, DPE-alt-1-PB and DPE-alt-DPB were used to change the kinetic behavior of the copolymerbyadjustingthepolymerizationtemperature, solvent and feeding ratio through LAP. The sequence was sub-sequently regulated. DPE-alt-CBVB is a strictly alternating polymerobtainedbytheAMROPmechanismthrough common anionic copolymerization and transfer ring-opening polymerization. After the polymeric backbone was hydrogen-ated and saturated, nonpolar olefins, such as ethylene, propy-lene and styrene, were successfully inserted into the DPE struc-tural unit according to different arrangement combinations; thus, a periodic polymer with a strict arrangement was obtained. When the polymer backbone was saturated, the Tg of the polymer decreased, indicating that the rotation of the carbon–carbon single bond increased the flexibility of the polymer. The Tg values of the polymers with similar periodic arrangements were different; these results indicated that the size of the polymer substituents and the density of the side group arrangement strongly influenced the polymer pro-perties. Furthermore, when the content of substituents was the same, a change in the carbon skeleton length affected the thermal performance of a polymer. Therefore, controlling the length of the periodic sequence, as well as the position, size, and arrangement density of the substituents, could signifi-cantly affect the performance of polymers.', 'Author contributions', 'The manuscript was written by all the authors and each author has contributed to the experiment.

And polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared through radical polymerization of 1-vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface-vinylated nanoparticles. The polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were utilized as a functional additive to prepare PPBI/polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. Imida-zole and sulfonated vinylbenzene groups on the surface of modified nanoparticles forming linkages with PPBI chains, improved the compatibility between PPBI and nanoparticles, and enhanced the mechanical strength of the prepared nanocomposite membranes. The prepared nanocomposite membranes showed higher water uptake and acid doping levels comparing to PPBI. Also, after acid doping with phosphoric acid, nanocomposite membranes exhibited enhanced proton conductivity in comparison to the pristine PPBI and PPBI/un-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. The enhancement in proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes resulted from modified SiO2 nanoparticles showed higher conductivity than modified TiO2 nanoparticles. The above results indicated that the PPBI/modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for medium temperature fuel cells.', '© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang- ers [1–3]. Sulfonated polysulfone (PSF) [4], polyetheretherketone (PEEK) [5,6] and polybenzimidazoles (PBIs) [7–11] are among poly-mers which can be used as alternatives for Nafion in PEFCs.', 'Amongpolybenzimidazolederivatives,poly[2,2-5,5(m-phenylene)-bibenzimidazole](PBI),whichisalsocalled commercial polybenzimidazole have been used as a mem-brane material in PEMFCs. Having high chemical as well as thermal resistance and proton conductivity, polybenzimidazoles are great options to be used in the fuel cells with function at elevated temperatures above 100 ◦C [12].', 'PBIs should have enough proton conductivity so that it could be used as proton exchange membranes in the fuel cells. To achieve this purpose, they are usually doped with a sufficient acid like H3PO4 to an appropriate doping level [13]. Nanocomposite membranes are a new group of membranes which contain nanopar-ticles such as SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 and other compounds [14–21]. The introduction of nanoparticles into the membranes results in a considerable improvement in their features like mechani-cal properties, methanol permeability, but in some cases leads to a decrease in proton conductivity [22–24]. In order to over-come this problem, surface functionalized nanoparticles, which means various compounds with polar groups grafted chemically to the surface of the nanoparticles [25–28], were used. As men-tioned before, the numerous research works were done concerning grafting various compounds on the SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles which used for different purposes. However, in this work, we have used monomer bearing functional groups like imidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene which can improve the properties of pro-ton conductive membranes. These monomers are polymerized on the surface of the nanoparticles and as a consequence, they can more affect the properties of the membranes than while one functional group is grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. In addition, the polymerization of the selected monomers such as vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface of nanoparticle could cause more compatibility between nanopar-ticles and polymer matrix which finally improve the mechanical properties. In this work, nanocomposite membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles and newly synthesized polybenzimidazole was depicted poly[2,2-5,5-(m-pyrazolidene)-bibenzimidazole] (PPBI). Modification of the mentioned nanoparticles was performed by radical polymerization of some vinyl monomers such as sulfonated styrene and vinylim-idazole on the surface of the nanoparticles to which vinylic group was bounded covalently. Also, the effect of surface modification on the properties of the nanocomposite membranes such as pro-ton conductivity, mechanical properties and water uptake were studied.', '@', '@', '2.

The FT-IR spectrum of the obtained powder did not show any absorbent bands related to PVI and PSV chains. The absorbent bands, which existed in the spectrum of mod-ified nanoparticles, were not observed in this spectrum.

Thermal analysis', 'Thermogravimetric analysis diagrams of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 5. Weight loss in 85 ◦C can be related to the release of physically absorbed water. In un-modified nanoparticles, the minor weight loss in elevated temperatures can be attributed to the loss of hydroxyl groups of the particle surface attached by covalent bonds. Weight loss in modified nanoparticles could be a result of thermal degradation of the polymeric chains grafted to the surface of the nanoparti-cles. Also, the weight loss in 230–300 ◦C was due to the thermal decomposition of the sulfonate groups in the grafted PSV chains [30].', 'Thermograms of PVI modified nanocomposite with 5, 10 and 15% of TiO2 are shown in Fig. 6. As it is observed, the thermal prop-erties of the nanocomposites prepared with various amounts of TiO2 are almost similar.

They were heated to temperatures about 1000 ◦C for 30 min and the obtained nanoparti-cles were weighed immediately. The difference between the weight of un-modified nanoparticles before and after heating shows the amount of lost water which was either physically absorbed or pro-duced from the condensation reaction of the hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticle surface. Also from the difference between the weight of modified nanoparticles before and after heating and consider- ing the weight of lost water, the percentage of the grafted polymer onto the nanoparticle surface was obtained.

Water uptake and doping level', 'Water uptake amount of nanocomposite membranes contain-ing 5, 10 and 15% of modified nanoparticles at 25 ◦C are shown in Fig. 8. Addition of silica nanoparticles to PPBI membranes increased their water uptakes due to the hygroscopic nature of SiO2 and TiO2nanoparticles. The sulfonic and imidazole groups in the nanopar-ticles increased the water uptake to a greater extent. The amount of water uptake for PPBI/TiO2-PSV, PPBI/SiO2-PSV, PPBI/TiO2-PVI and PPBI/SiO2-PVI are 21.6, 22.7, 20.4 and 21.9%, respectively. The effect of sulfonic acid groups of PSV chains grafted onto the nanoparticle surface on the water uptake is more than imidazole groups in PVI chains due to the higher hygroscopic properties of PSV comparing to PVI chains grafted on to the silica nanopar-ticle surface. The water uptake of PPBI/SiO2-PSV is higher than PPBI/TiO2-PSV which can be due to the further increase of the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles in comparison to TiO2 nanoparticle surface.', 'The PPBI-based membranes were doped with 85% H3PO4 to prepare the acid-doped membranes. Fig. 9 shows the acid-doping levels of the PPBI-based nanocomposite membranes.

As an example, for saturated steam the pressure cor-responding to 120 ◦C is 205 kPa. The time of exposure to saturated steam at 120 ◦C was 30 min that this value for temperature of 140 ◦C was increased to 50 min.', 'Fig. 10 shows the Nyquist plot and equivalent circuit of studied membranes at 25 ◦C and RH 100% for some membranes.', 'After fitting the EIS experimental data on the electrical equiv-alent circuit, the membrane proton conductivity was determined from the intercept of EIS data with real impedance Z′ axis (as the value of Rm element).

Similar trends were also reported to other nanocomposite membranes like Nafion®/silica membranes and PBI/silica membranes [31].', '@', '@', 'On the other hand, comparing the pristine PPBI and Nafion®117 membranes, the relatively high proton conductivities of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles are noteworthy [32]. Li et al. have used sulfonated organosilica to modify Nafion® membranes and they found that the proton con-ductivities of the modified membranes were still lower than that of the neat Nafion® membrane.', 'The reduction in the proton conductivity was attributed to the silica-induced changes in the tortuous paths and in the dis-tribution of hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains. However, in this work an enhancing effect on the proton conductivity was observed with addition of PSV and PVI grafted nanoparticles to PPBI mem-brane. The sulfonic and imidazole groups of modified nanoparticles also contribute in the acid-doping effect to PPBI polymer so as to enhance the proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles. Moreover, the presence of modified nanoparticles induces proton conductive pathways lead-ing to an increase in the proton conductivities of PPBI/modified nanoparticles membranes [24].', 'The proton conductivities of the acid-doped nanocompos-ite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 12) were further studied at high temperatures under an anhydrous environment. All the PPBI/modified nanoparticle membranes still exhibited higher proton conductivities than the pristine acid-doped PPBI membrane.', '@', '@', 'Generally, two principle mechanisms of vehicle mechanism and Grotthuss mechanism (hopping) describe proton diffusion through the membrane [33]. It is possible that the bounded water par-ticipates by the Grotthuss mechanism, and the free water takes part mostly by vehicle mechanism [34]. Addition of silica-SO3H to the membranes increases the bounded water content in the membranes (Fig. 13). The bounded water facilitates the proton transport ability through the Grotthuss mechanism, originating by generation of a continuous proton conductive pathway. There-fore, the high proton conductivity of PPBI/modified nanoparticles can be attributed to the high bounded water content in the membrane.', 'Since the Grotthuss-type diffusion mechanism without assis-tance of the vehicle mechanism has been proposed for the protonconductionunderanhydrousenvironments[35,36], theprotonconductivityoftheacid-dopedPPBI/modified nanoparticlemembranescouldbesynergisticallyresulted from their modified nanoparticle contents and the acid-doping levels.', 'Consequently, the highest proton conductivity was obtained withtheacid-dopedPPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%membraneathigh humidity and low temperatures and PPBI/SiO2-PVI-15% mem-brane in high temperatures and low humidity, which possesses the moderate modified nanoparticles content and acid-doping level.', 'As it is seen in Fig. 9, either we use PSV-modified or un-modified nanoparticles, the increase in the amount of the nanoparticles leads to a decrease in the acid doping level, but when PVI-modified nanoparticles were used, doping level increased.

Proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PSV-modified nanoparticles shows significant increase in comparison to PVI-modified ones in low temperature and high rel-ative humidity. But in high temperature and low relative humidity, proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PVI-modified nanoparticles is observed to be more than PSV-modified ones and even at 145 ◦C the proton conductivity of PPBI/SiO2-PVI 15% is more than PPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%.

Consequently, high proton conductiv-ity can be a result of these changes. It should be mentioned that in temperatures higher than 100 ◦C and in very low relative humidity, water uptake of PSV-modified membranes decreases which leads to low efficiency of the sulfonic groups attached onto the surface of the nanoparticles which in turn results in a decrease in proton conduc-tivity in both membranes, but the increase in proton conductivity resulting from high doping level is significant and also the proton conductivity of PVI-modified nanocomposite membranes increase in high temperatures.', 'It is noteworthy that Nafion® 117 shows relatively low pro-ton conductivities under anhydrous conditions and almost lacks its proton conductivities at high temperatures. Comparing to Nafion®117 membranes, the high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicate that this membrane could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', '3.5.

Introduction of modified and un-modified nanoparticles increases the brittleness of the nanocomposite mem-branes with a decrease in their elongations at break. The effects of modified and unmodified nanoparticles on the elongations at break of the nanocomposite membranes were different. The decrease in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness were widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inorganic reinforcement [37–39].

Box 5166616471, Tabriz, Iran', 'a r t i c l ei n f o', 'a b s t r a c t', 'Article history: Received 4 July 2010 Received in revised form 21 October 2010 Accepted 23 October 2010 Available online 4 November 2010', 'Keywords: Polybenzimidazole Proton exchange membrane Modified nanoparticles Sulfonated vinylbenzene Vinylimidazole', 'Poly[2,2′-(m-pyrazolidene)-5,5′-bibenzimidazole](PPBI)wassynthesizedfrompyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylic acid and 3,3′,4,4′-tetraaminobiphenyle (TAB) through polycondensation reaction in polyphosphoric acid (PPA) as reaction solvent. And polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared through radical polymerization of 1-vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface-vinylated nanoparticles. The polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were utilized as a functional additive to prepare PPBI/polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. Imida-zole and sulfonated vinylbenzene groups on the surface of modified nanoparticles forming linkages with PPBI chains, improved the compatibility between PPBI and nanoparticles, and enhanced the mechanical strength of the prepared nanocomposite membranes. The prepared nanocomposite membranes showed higher water uptake and acid doping levels comparing to PPBI. Also, after acid doping with phosphoric acid, nanocomposite membranes exhibited enhanced proton conductivity in comparison to the pristine PPBI and PPBI/un-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. The enhancement in proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes resulted from modified SiO2 nanoparticles showed higher conductivity than modified TiO2 nanoparticles. The above results indicated that the PPBI/modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for medium temperature fuel cells.', '© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang- ers [1–3]. Sulfonated polysulfone (PSF) [4], polyetheretherketone (PEEK) [5,6] and polybenzimidazoles (PBIs) [7–11] are among poly-mers which can be used as alternatives for Nafion in PEFCs.', 'Amongpolybenzimidazolederivatives,poly[2,2-5,5(m-phenylene)-bibenzimidazole](PBI),whichisalsocalled commercial polybenzimidazole have been used as a mem-brane material in PEMFCs. Having high chemical as well as thermal resistance and proton conductivity, polybenzimidazoles are great options to be used in the fuel cells with function at elevated temperatures above 100 ◦C [12].', 'PBIs should have enough proton conductivity so that it could be used as proton exchange membranes in the fuel cells. To achieve this purpose, they are usually doped with a sufficient acid like H3PO4 to an appropriate doping level [13]. Nanocomposite membranes are a new group of membranes which contain nanopar-ticles such as SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 and other compounds [14–21]. The introduction of nanoparticles into the membranes results in a considerable improvement in their features like mechani-cal properties, methanol permeability, but in some cases leads to a decrease in proton conductivity [22–24]. In order to over-come this problem, surface functionalized nanoparticles, which means various compounds with polar groups grafted chemically to the surface of the nanoparticles [25–28], were used. As men-tioned before, the numerous research works were done concerning grafting various compounds on the SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles which used for different purposes. However, in this work, we have used monomer bearing functional groups like imidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene which can improve the properties of pro-ton conductive membranes. These monomers are polymerized on the surface of the nanoparticles and as a consequence, they can more affect the properties of the membranes than while one functional group is grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. In addition, the polymerization of the selected monomers such as vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface of nanoparticle could cause more compatibility between nanopar-ticles and polymer matrix which finally improve the mechanical properties. In this work, nanocomposite membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles and newly synthesized polybenzimidazole was depicted poly[2,2-5,5-(m-pyrazolidene)-bibenzimidazole] (PPBI). Modification of the mentioned nanoparticles was performed by radical polymerization of some vinyl monomers such as sulfonated styrene and vinylim-idazole on the surface of the nanoparticles to which vinylic group was bounded covalently. Also, the effect of surface modification on the properties of the nanocomposite membranes such as pro-ton conductivity, mechanical properties and water uptake were studied.', '@', '@', '2.

The monomers and polyphos-phoric acid were added to a three-necked flask under argon atmosphere and stirred using mechanical overhead stirrer for 18 h at 170 ◦C and 8 h at 220 ◦C. After reaction completion, the vis-cose mixture was precipitated in water. It was then separated, neutralized with sodium hydroxide solution (10% w/w), washed thoroughly with water and dried in a vacuum oven for 24 h at 60 ◦C to obtain PPBI.', '2.3. Modification of TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles', 'One gram of TiO2 nanoparticles dried at 100 ◦C under vacuum was added into a 250 mL flask containing 100 mL of dry THF and 10 mL of dried trichlorovinylsilane (coupling agent) under argon atmosphere. The resulting dispersion was stirred at room tempera-ture for 48 h. After completion of the reaction, the surface vinylated TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2-vinylated) were separated and washed with THF several times to remove un-reacted trichlorovinylsilane.

The absence of absorbent peak related to amine group proton (N–H) in the area of 4.0–5.0 ppm and an absorbent related to amide group in the area of 10.3–10.6 ppm show the complete closure of imidazole rings during the polycondensation reaction.', 'In FT-IR characteristics of PPBI, the presence of absorbent bands in 800 cm−1 is related to the vibration of C–H bond of imida-zole, a band in about 1300 cm−1 is related to the vibration of C–N bond of imidazole, the absorbent band in 1450 cm−1 is related to C N and C C vibrations and bands in the area of 3400 cm−1 and 3140 cm−1 are related to N–H vibrations. All the above absorbent bands confirm the synthesis of PPBI. Furthermore, the absence of the absorbent band related to the carbonyl group in the vicinity of 1760 cm−1 can be confirmed as an evidence of the completion of cyclization reaction.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The FT-IR spectra of modified and un-modified SiO2 nanoparti-cles are shown in Fig. 4(a and b, c), respectively. The presence of the absorbent bands in 3050 cm−1 and 3100 cm−1 can be related to aromatic C–H bonds and also the existence of bands in the area of 2950 cm−1 can be attributed to aliphatic C–H bonds. Also the peaks in 1619 and 1419 cm−1 can be due to C C and C N bonds. In Fig. 4(c), the presence of the absorbent band in 1257 cm−1 is cor-responded to S O bond of the sulfonic acid group. These prove the existence of polymeric chains that are grafted onto the nanoparticle surface.', 'FT-IR spectra of the modified nanoparticles have been measured after complete washing and drying. To be sure of the chemical bonding of all chains (not physical) onto the particle surface, some un-modified nanoparticles were mixed with polymeric solutions of PVI and PSV and were stirred for 1 h. After filtration, the washing method used to wash the modified nanoparticles, was applied to the resulting powder as well. The FT-IR spectrum of the obtained powder did not show any absorbent bands related to PVI and PSV chains. The absorbent bands, which existed in the spectrum of mod-ified nanoparticles, were not observed in this spectrum. So, it was indicated that the polymeric chains have been attached to the par-ticles surface via covalent bonds.', '3.2. Thermal analysis', 'Thermogravimetric analysis diagrams of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 5. Weight loss in 85 ◦C can be related to the release of physically absorbed water. In un-modified nanoparticles, the minor weight loss in elevated temperatures can be attributed to the loss of hydroxyl groups of the particle surface attached by covalent bonds. Weight loss in modified nanoparticles could be a result of thermal degradation of the polymeric chains grafted to the surface of the nanoparti-cles. Also, the weight loss in 230–300 ◦C was due to the thermal decomposition of the sulfonate groups in the grafted PSV chains [30].', 'Thermograms of PVI modified nanocomposite with 5, 10 and 15% of TiO2 are shown in Fig. 6. As it is observed, the thermal prop-erties of the nanocomposites prepared with various amounts of TiO2 are almost similar. For this reason, in order to compare the thermal properties of other nanocomposites which prepared with modified nanoparticles having different monomers, only the TGA thermograms of nanocomposite containing of 10% (between 5% and 15%) modified nanoparticles are reported.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The remaining weight percentage in 850 ◦C is related to the modified TiO2 that is less than the added amount of PVI-modified TiO2 nanoparticles when the membrane was prepared. This decrease in weight in comparison with the theoretical amount could be related due to the degradation of the chains grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. Also, in order to obtain the par-ticular weight of the modified nanoparticles, specific amounts of modified and un-modified nanoparticles were weighed after and before complete burning out all the polymers. They were heated to temperatures about 1000 ◦C for 30 min and the obtained nanoparti-cles were weighed immediately. The difference between the weight of un-modified nanoparticles before and after heating shows the amount of lost water which was either physically absorbed or pro-duced from the condensation reaction of the hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticle surface. Also from the difference between the weight of modified nanoparticles before and after heating and consider- ing the weight of lost water, the percentage of the grafted polymer onto the nanoparticle surface was obtained. The obtained results and theoretical amounts are shown in Table 1. The amounts of the obtained results in all cases are more than theoretical values.

The weight loss observed in the tempera-ture range of 50–140 ◦C is a result of the release of water adsorbed into the membranes which is less significant in nanocomposites in comparison to pure membrane.', 'The second loss in weight, observed at the temperature range of 500–530 ◦C, is also attributed to the thermal degradation of poly-meric backbone of the nanocomposite membranes which is almost identical to the degradation temperature of pure PPBI. As a result, the addition of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles do not have any noticeable effect on thermal stability of the prepared nanocomposites.', 'As it is observed in Fig. 7, the degradation of PVI-modified nanoparticles occurs at 185 ◦C which is lower than the related tem-perature of PSV-modified ones. Therefore, the former one can be used in fuel cells with performance under 150 ◦C, but PSV-modified membrane is more suitable in high temperature fuel cells.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '3.3. Water uptake and doping level', 'Water uptake amount of nanocomposite membranes contain-ing 5, 10 and 15% of modified nanoparticles at 25 ◦C are shown in Fig. 8. Addition of silica nanoparticles to PPBI membranes increased their water uptakes due to the hygroscopic nature of SiO2 and TiO2nanoparticles. The sulfonic and imidazole groups in the nanopar-ticles increased the water uptake to a greater extent. The amount of water uptake for PPBI/TiO2-PSV, PPBI/SiO2-PSV, PPBI/TiO2-PVI and PPBI/SiO2-PVI are 21.6, 22.7, 20.4 and 21.9%, respectively. The effect of sulfonic acid groups of PSV chains grafted onto the nanoparticle surface on the water uptake is more than imidazole groups in PVI chains due to the higher hygroscopic properties of PSV comparing to PVI chains grafted on to the silica nanopar-ticle surface. The water uptake of PPBI/SiO2-PSV is higher than PPBI/TiO2-PSV which can be due to the further increase of the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles in comparison to TiO2 nanoparticle surface.', 'The PPBI-based membranes were doped with 85% H3PO4 to prepare the acid-doped membranes. Fig. 9 shows the acid-doping levels of the PPBI-based nanocomposite membranes. Acid-doping level (H3PO4 molecules per PPBI repeating unit) of pristine PPBI membrane was 13.5, which decreased to 11.8 for PPBI/SiO2, 12.0 for PPBI/SiO2-PSV, 11.7 for PPBI/TiO2 and 12.2 for PPBI/TiO2-PSV with 10% nanoparticle content and increased to 15.8 for PPBI/SiO2-PVI and 15.2 for PPBI/TiO2-PVI. Some of the amino groups in PPBI chains were blocked with the sulfonic acid groups of TiO2-PSV and SiO2-PSV, to decrease the binding ability of PPBI chains to H3PO4molecules.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Among the prepared nanocomposites, the water uptake in PPBI/SiO2-PSV and acid doping in PPBI/SiO2-PVI were the most one. Even in the comparison of these membranes with the simi-lar ones which prepared from modified TiO2 such as PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, the amount of water uptake and doping level were higher. This shows that using modified SiO2 nanoparticles in fuel cells is more appropriate.', '3.4. Proton conductivity', 'The membrane was sandwiched between two stainless steel electrodes and pressed together by clamp. Then, the MEA (Mem-brane Electrolyte Assembly) was inputted in the steam autoclave equipped with temperature controller. For measurement of pro-ton conductivity, the steam autoclave supplied with steam from a house generator for exposure to saturated steam at desired temperature. As an example, for saturated steam the pressure cor-responding to 120 ◦C is 205 kPa. The time of exposure to saturated steam at 120 ◦C was 30 min that this value for temperature of 140 ◦C was increased to 50 min.', 'Fig. 10 shows the Nyquist plot and equivalent circuit of studied membranes at 25 ◦C and RH 100% for some membranes.', 'After fitting the EIS experimental data on the electrical equiv-alent circuit, the membrane proton conductivity was determined from the intercept of EIS data with real impedance Z′ axis (as the value of Rm element). In equivalent circuit, Rm presents the resis-tance of the polymer film between the two metallic electrodes toward charge carriers (i.e. H+). L1 presents the stray inductance of the setup wires. CPE1 presents the non-ideal double layer capac-itance of the film/metal electrode interface. Rct and W0 show the charge transfer resistance of the (possible) reactions at the film/metal electrode interface and the diffusion processes through the polymers film, respectively. The proton conductivities of the phosphoric acid-doped PPBI based nanocomposite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 11) at 100% relative humidity were presented as a function of temperatures up to 80 ◦C. The pro-ton conductivities of all membranes increased with increasing the operation temperature up to 80 ◦C. Addition of the un-modified nanoparticles showed a negative effect on the proton conductivities of nanocomposite membranes. Similar trends were also reported to other nanocomposite membranes like Nafion®/silica membranes and PBI/silica membranes [31].', '@', '@', 'On the other hand, comparing the pristine PPBI and Nafion®117 membranes, the relatively high proton conductivities of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles are noteworthy [32]. Li et al. have used sulfonated organosilica to modify Nafion® membranes and they found that the proton con-ductivities of the modified membranes were still lower than that of the neat Nafion® membrane.', 'The reduction in the proton conductivity was attributed to the silica-induced changes in the tortuous paths and in the dis-tribution of hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains. However, in this work an enhancing effect on the proton conductivity was observed with addition of PSV and PVI grafted nanoparticles to PPBI mem-brane. The sulfonic and imidazole groups of modified nanoparticles also contribute in the acid-doping effect to PPBI polymer so as to enhance the proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles. Moreover, the presence of modified nanoparticles induces proton conductive pathways lead-ing to an increase in the proton conductivities of PPBI/modified nanoparticles membranes [24].', 'The proton conductivities of the acid-doped nanocompos-ite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 12) were further studied at high temperatures under an anhydrous environment. All the PPBI/modified nanoparticle membranes still exhibited higher proton conductivities than the pristine acid-doped PPBI membrane.', '@', '@', 'Generally, two principle mechanisms of vehicle mechanism and Grotthuss mechanism (hopping) describe proton diffusion through the membrane [33]. It is possible that the bounded water par-ticipates by the Grotthuss mechanism, and the free water takes part mostly by vehicle mechanism [34]. Addition of silica-SO3H to the membranes increases the bounded water content in the membranes (Fig. 13). The bounded water facilitates the proton transport ability through the Grotthuss mechanism, originating by generation of a continuous proton conductive pathway. There-fore, the high proton conductivity of PPBI/modified nanoparticles can be attributed to the high bounded water content in the membrane.', 'Since the Grotthuss-type diffusion mechanism without assis-tance of the vehicle mechanism has been proposed for the protonconductionunderanhydrousenvironments[35,36], theprotonconductivityoftheacid-dopedPPBI/modified nanoparticlemembranescouldbesynergisticallyresulted from their modified nanoparticle contents and the acid-doping levels.', 'Consequently, the highest proton conductivity was obtained withtheacid-dopedPPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%membraneathigh humidity and low temperatures and PPBI/SiO2-PVI-15% mem-brane in high temperatures and low humidity, which possesses the moderate modified nanoparticles content and acid-doping level.', 'As it is seen in Fig. 9, either we use PSV-modified or un-modified nanoparticles, the increase in the amount of the nanoparticles leads to a decrease in the acid doping level, but when PVI-modified nanoparticles were used, doping level increased. Also, according to Fig. 8, water uptake of the membrane shows an increase when using higher amounts of modified nanoparticles. This increase in PSV-modified nanocomposite membranesishigherinPVI-modified one. Proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PSV-modified nanoparticles shows significant increase in comparison to PVI-modified ones in low temperature and high rel-ative humidity. But in high temperature and low relative humidity, proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PVI-modified nanoparticles is observed to be more than PSV-modified ones and even at 145 ◦C the proton conductivity of PPBI/SiO2-PVI 15% is more than PPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%. The exis-tence of modified nanoparticles in PPBI nanocomposite membranes results in high proton conductivity in three ways:', '@', '@', '1) With increase in water uptake 2) With increase in the amount of doping level and 3) With increase in the number of proton conductive functional groups such as sulfonic acid group.', 'In PSV-modified nanocomposite membranes, acid doping decreases while the water uptake and the number of sulfonic acid groups shows an increase. Consequently, high proton conductiv-ity can be a result of these changes. It should be mentioned that in temperatures higher than 100 ◦C and in very low relative humidity, water uptake of PSV-modified membranes decreases which leads to low efficiency of the sulfonic groups attached onto the surface of the nanoparticles which in turn results in a decrease in proton conduc-tivity in both membranes, but the increase in proton conductivity resulting from high doping level is significant and also the proton conductivity of PVI-modified nanocomposite membranes increase in high temperatures.', 'It is noteworthy that Nafion® 117 shows relatively low pro-ton conductivities under anhydrous conditions and almost lacks its proton conductivities at high temperatures. Comparing to Nafion®117 membranes, the high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicate that this membrane could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', '3.5. Mechanical properties', 'The mechanical properties of the PPBI-based membranes were measured. The stress–strain curves are shown in Fig. 14. Pristine PPBI membrane showed an elongation at break of 38%. Mod-ification of nanocomposites with SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles results in an increase in the tensile strengths and a subse-quent decrease in the elongations at break for the PPBI-based membranes. For PPBI/modified nanoparticles nanocomposites membranes (PPBI/modified nanocomposite consists of the PPBI and surface-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles by PVI and PSV chains and PPBI/unmodified nanocomposite includes PPBI and SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles without any treatment), the presence of ionic linkages between PPBI and silica particles can be assigned to their high Young’s modulus. Introduction of modified and un-modified nanoparticles increases the brittleness of the nanocomposite mem-branes with a decrease in their elongations at break. The effects of modified and unmodified nanoparticles on the elongations at break of the nanocomposite membranes were different. The decrease in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness were widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inorganic reinforcement [37–39]. Moreover, the ionic linkages in nanocomposite membranes prepared from modi-fied nanoparticles are higher than hydrogen bonding in PPBI/SiO2and PPBI/TiO2.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The brittleness of PPBI/TiO2 based nanocomposite membranes is higher than PPBI/SiO2 ones.

Also the major amounts of nanoparticles size are in the range of nanoscale and the bigger parti-cles as evidence for the formation of aggregations are not observed. The size of the TiO2-PSV particles are about 25–40 nm and the size of particles on the surface of the nanocomposite are determined to be 30–60 nm.', 'Fig. 16(a) shows the SEM micrographs of the modified SiO2nanoparticles. If the interactions between silica nanoparticles are stronger than that of between PPBI molecules and silica nanoparticles, the silica nanoparticles are agglomerated together to form silica domains in micrometer sizes. The compatibility between PPBI and unmodified nanoparticles and the homogene-ity of the PPBI/SiO2 or PPBI/TiO2 membranes are somewhat poor [32].', 'However, the dispersion homogeneity of silica nanoparticles in PPBI membranes could be significantly improved with using surface modified nanoparticles as the additives. As shown in Fig. 16(b), the dispersion homogeneity of modified nanoparticles is observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2 nanocomposite membrane, which demonstrates high compatibility between PPBI polymer and PSV-SiO2 nanoparticles and the high dispersion abil-ity of PSV-SiO2 in PPBI matrix. Particle agglomeration is still not observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2-10%. The ionic linkages between PPBI and modified nanoparticles are contributed to their higher compatibility [32].

Conclusion', 'The nanocomposite PPBI-based membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified and un-modified TiO2 and SiO2nanoparticles. The thermal stability of the prepared nanocompos- ite membranes was similar to PPBI membrane. The water uptake of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from TiO2/PSV and SiO2/PSV nanoparticles were higher than other nanocomposite membranes. The acid doping level and proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes in dry conditions obtained from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI nanoparticles were the highest in comparison to PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV. Formation of nanocomposites with modified and un-modified nanoparticles resulted the increas-ing of tensile strengths. The decreasing in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness was widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inor-ganic reinforcement.

And polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared through radical polymerization of 1-vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface-vinylated nanoparticles. The polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were utilized as a functional additive to prepare PPBI/polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. Imida-zole and sulfonated vinylbenzene groups on the surface of modified nanoparticles forming linkages with PPBI chains, improved the compatibility between PPBI and nanoparticles, and enhanced the mechanical strength of the prepared nanocomposite membranes. The prepared nanocomposite membranes showed higher water uptake and acid doping levels comparing to PPBI. Also, after acid doping with phosphoric acid, nanocomposite membranes exhibited enhanced proton conductivity in comparison to the pristine PPBI and PPBI/un-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. The enhancement in proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes resulted from modified SiO2 nanoparticles showed higher conductivity than modified TiO2 nanoparticles. The above results indicated that the PPBI/modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for medium temperature fuel cells.', '© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang- ers [1–3]. Sulfonated polysulfone (PSF) [4], polyetheretherketone (PEEK) [5,6] and polybenzimidazoles (PBIs) [7–11] are among poly-mers which can be used as alternatives for Nafion in PEFCs.', 'Amongpolybenzimidazolederivatives,poly[2,2-5,5(m-phenylene)-bibenzimidazole](PBI),whichisalsocalled commercial polybenzimidazole have been used as a mem-brane material in PEMFCs. Having high chemical as well as thermal resistance and proton conductivity, polybenzimidazoles are great options to be used in the fuel cells with function at elevated temperatures above 100 ◦C [12].', 'PBIs should have enough proton conductivity so that it could be used as proton exchange membranes in the fuel cells. To achieve this purpose, they are usually doped with a sufficient acid like H3PO4 to an appropriate doping level [13]. Nanocomposite membranes are a new group of membranes which contain nanopar-ticles such as SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 and other compounds [14–21]. The introduction of nanoparticles into the membranes results in a considerable improvement in their features like mechani-cal properties, methanol permeability, but in some cases leads to a decrease in proton conductivity [22–24]. In order to over-come this problem, surface functionalized nanoparticles, which means various compounds with polar groups grafted chemically to the surface of the nanoparticles [25–28], were used. As men-tioned before, the numerous research works were done concerning grafting various compounds on the SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles which used for different purposes. However, in this work, we have used monomer bearing functional groups like imidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene which can improve the properties of pro-ton conductive membranes. These monomers are polymerized on the surface of the nanoparticles and as a consequence, they can more affect the properties of the membranes than while one functional group is grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. In addition, the polymerization of the selected monomers such as vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface of nanoparticle could cause more compatibility between nanopar-ticles and polymer matrix which finally improve the mechanical properties. In this work, nanocomposite membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles and newly synthesized polybenzimidazole was depicted poly[2,2-5,5-(m-pyrazolidene)-bibenzimidazole] (PPBI). Modification of the mentioned nanoparticles was performed by radical polymerization of some vinyl monomers such as sulfonated styrene and vinylim-idazole on the surface of the nanoparticles to which vinylic group was bounded covalently. Also, the effect of surface modification on the properties of the nanocomposite membranes such as pro-ton conductivity, mechanical properties and water uptake were studied.', '@', '@', '2.

The absence of absorbent peak related to amine group proton (N–H) in the area of 4.0–5.0 ppm and an absorbent related to amide group in the area of 10.3–10.6 ppm show the complete closure of imidazole rings during the polycondensation reaction.', 'In FT-IR characteristics of PPBI, the presence of absorbent bands in 800 cm−1 is related to the vibration of C–H bond of imida-zole, a band in about 1300 cm−1 is related to the vibration of C–N bond of imidazole, the absorbent band in 1450 cm−1 is related to C N and C C vibrations and bands in the area of 3400 cm−1 and 3140 cm−1 are related to N–H vibrations. All the above absorbent bands confirm the synthesis of PPBI. Furthermore, the absence of the absorbent band related to the carbonyl group in the vicinity of 1760 cm−1 can be confirmed as an evidence of the completion of cyclization reaction.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The FT-IR spectra of modified and un-modified SiO2 nanoparti-cles are shown in Fig. 4(a and b, c), respectively. The presence of the absorbent bands in 3050 cm−1 and 3100 cm−1 can be related to aromatic C–H bonds and also the existence of bands in the area of 2950 cm−1 can be attributed to aliphatic C–H bonds. Also the peaks in 1619 and 1419 cm−1 can be due to C C and C N bonds. In Fig. 4(c), the presence of the absorbent band in 1257 cm−1 is cor-responded to S O bond of the sulfonic acid group. These prove the existence of polymeric chains that are grafted onto the nanoparticle surface.', 'FT-IR spectra of the modified nanoparticles have been measured after complete washing and drying. To be sure of the chemical bonding of all chains (not physical) onto the particle surface, some un-modified nanoparticles were mixed with polymeric solutions of PVI and PSV and were stirred for 1 h. After filtration, the washing method used to wash the modified nanoparticles, was applied to the resulting powder as well. The FT-IR spectrum of the obtained powder did not show any absorbent bands related to PVI and PSV chains. The absorbent bands, which existed in the spectrum of mod-ified nanoparticles, were not observed in this spectrum. So, it was indicated that the polymeric chains have been attached to the par-ticles surface via covalent bonds.', '3.2. Thermal analysis', 'Thermogravimetric analysis diagrams of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 5. Weight loss in 85 ◦C can be related to the release of physically absorbed water. In un-modified nanoparticles, the minor weight loss in elevated temperatures can be attributed to the loss of hydroxyl groups of the particle surface attached by covalent bonds. Weight loss in modified nanoparticles could be a result of thermal degradation of the polymeric chains grafted to the surface of the nanoparti-cles. Also, the weight loss in 230–300 ◦C was due to the thermal decomposition of the sulfonate groups in the grafted PSV chains [30].', 'Thermograms of PVI modified nanocomposite with 5, 10 and 15% of TiO2 are shown in Fig. 6. As it is observed, the thermal prop-erties of the nanocomposites prepared with various amounts of TiO2 are almost similar. For this reason, in order to compare the thermal properties of other nanocomposites which prepared with modified nanoparticles having different monomers, only the TGA thermograms of nanocomposite containing of 10% (between 5% and 15%) modified nanoparticles are reported.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The remaining weight percentage in 850 ◦C is related to the modified TiO2 that is less than the added amount of PVI-modified TiO2 nanoparticles when the membrane was prepared. This decrease in weight in comparison with the theoretical amount could be related due to the degradation of the chains grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. Also, in order to obtain the par-ticular weight of the modified nanoparticles, specific amounts of modified and un-modified nanoparticles were weighed after and before complete burning out all the polymers. They were heated to temperatures about 1000 ◦C for 30 min and the obtained nanoparti-cles were weighed immediately. The difference between the weight of un-modified nanoparticles before and after heating shows the amount of lost water which was either physically absorbed or pro-duced from the condensation reaction of the hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticle surface. Also from the difference between the weight of modified nanoparticles before and after heating and consider- ing the weight of lost water, the percentage of the grafted polymer onto the nanoparticle surface was obtained. The obtained results and theoretical amounts are shown in Table 1. The amounts of the obtained results in all cases are more than theoretical values. This could be related to the presence of free water molecules and hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticles surface in which their values are not subtracted from theoretical values.', '@', '@', 'The diagrams of thermogravimetric analysis of both PPBI and nanocomposites prepared from the modified nanoparticles (10% w/w) are shown in Fig. 7. The weight loss observed in the tempera-ture range of 50–140 ◦C is a result of the release of water adsorbed into the membranes which is less significant in nanocomposites in comparison to pure membrane.', 'The second loss in weight, observed at the temperature range of 500–530 ◦C, is also attributed to the thermal degradation of poly-meric backbone of the nanocomposite membranes which is almost identical to the degradation temperature of pure PPBI. As a result, the addition of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles do not have any noticeable effect on thermal stability of the prepared nanocomposites.', 'As it is observed in Fig. 7, the degradation of PVI-modified nanoparticles occurs at 185 ◦C which is lower than the related tem-perature of PSV-modified ones. Therefore, the former one can be used in fuel cells with performance under 150 ◦C, but PSV-modified membrane is more suitable in high temperature fuel cells.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '3.3. Water uptake and doping level', 'Water uptake amount of nanocomposite membranes contain-ing 5, 10 and 15% of modified nanoparticles at 25 ◦C are shown in Fig. 8. Addition of silica nanoparticles to PPBI membranes increased their water uptakes due to the hygroscopic nature of SiO2 and TiO2nanoparticles. The sulfonic and imidazole groups in the nanopar-ticles increased the water uptake to a greater extent. The amount of water uptake for PPBI/TiO2-PSV, PPBI/SiO2-PSV, PPBI/TiO2-PVI and PPBI/SiO2-PVI are 21.6, 22.7, 20.4 and 21.9%, respectively. The effect of sulfonic acid groups of PSV chains grafted onto the nanoparticle surface on the water uptake is more than imidazole groups in PVI chains due to the higher hygroscopic properties of PSV comparing to PVI chains grafted on to the silica nanopar-ticle surface. The water uptake of PPBI/SiO2-PSV is higher than PPBI/TiO2-PSV which can be due to the further increase of the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles in comparison to TiO2 nanoparticle surface.', 'The PPBI-based membranes were doped with 85% H3PO4 to prepare the acid-doped membranes. Fig. 9 shows the acid-doping levels of the PPBI-based nanocomposite membranes. Acid-doping level (H3PO4 molecules per PPBI repeating unit) of pristine PPBI membrane was 13.5, which decreased to 11.8 for PPBI/SiO2, 12.0 for PPBI/SiO2-PSV, 11.7 for PPBI/TiO2 and 12.2 for PPBI/TiO2-PSV with 10% nanoparticle content and increased to 15.8 for PPBI/SiO2-PVI and 15.2 for PPBI/TiO2-PVI. Some of the amino groups in PPBI chains were blocked with the sulfonic acid groups of TiO2-PSV and SiO2-PSV, to decrease the binding ability of PPBI chains to H3PO4molecules.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Among the prepared nanocomposites, the water uptake in PPBI/SiO2-PSV and acid doping in PPBI/SiO2-PVI were the most one. Even in the comparison of these membranes with the simi-lar ones which prepared from modified TiO2 such as PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, the amount of water uptake and doping level were higher. This shows that using modified SiO2 nanoparticles in fuel cells is more appropriate.', '3.4. Proton conductivity', 'The membrane was sandwiched between two stainless steel electrodes and pressed together by clamp. Then, the MEA (Mem-brane Electrolyte Assembly) was inputted in the steam autoclave equipped with temperature controller. For measurement of pro-ton conductivity, the steam autoclave supplied with steam from a house generator for exposure to saturated steam at desired temperature. As an example, for saturated steam the pressure cor-responding to 120 ◦C is 205 kPa. The time of exposure to saturated steam at 120 ◦C was 30 min that this value for temperature of 140 ◦C was increased to 50 min.', 'Fig. 10 shows the Nyquist plot and equivalent circuit of studied membranes at 25 ◦C and RH 100% for some membranes.', 'After fitting the EIS experimental data on the electrical equiv-alent circuit, the membrane proton conductivity was determined from the intercept of EIS data with real impedance Z′ axis (as the value of Rm element). In equivalent circuit, Rm presents the resis-tance of the polymer film between the two metallic electrodes toward charge carriers (i.e. H+). L1 presents the stray inductance of the setup wires. CPE1 presents the non-ideal double layer capac-itance of the film/metal electrode interface. Rct and W0 show the charge transfer resistance of the (possible) reactions at the film/metal electrode interface and the diffusion processes through the polymers film, respectively. The proton conductivities of the phosphoric acid-doped PPBI based nanocomposite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 11) at 100% relative humidity were presented as a function of temperatures up to 80 ◦C. The pro-ton conductivities of all membranes increased with increasing the operation temperature up to 80 ◦C. Addition of the un-modified nanoparticles showed a negative effect on the proton conductivities of nanocomposite membranes. Similar trends were also reported to other nanocomposite membranes like Nafion®/silica membranes and PBI/silica membranes [31].', '@', '@', 'On the other hand, comparing the pristine PPBI and Nafion®117 membranes, the relatively high proton conductivities of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles are noteworthy [32]. Li et al. have used sulfonated organosilica to modify Nafion® membranes and they found that the proton con-ductivities of the modified membranes were still lower than that of the neat Nafion® membrane.', 'The reduction in the proton conductivity was attributed to the silica-induced changes in the tortuous paths and in the dis-tribution of hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains. However, in this work an enhancing effect on the proton conductivity was observed with addition of PSV and PVI grafted nanoparticles to PPBI mem-brane. The sulfonic and imidazole groups of modified nanoparticles also contribute in the acid-doping effect to PPBI polymer so as to enhance the proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles. Moreover, the presence of modified nanoparticles induces proton conductive pathways lead-ing to an increase in the proton conductivities of PPBI/modified nanoparticles membranes [24].', 'The proton conductivities of the acid-doped nanocompos-ite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 12) were further studied at high temperatures under an anhydrous environment. All the PPBI/modified nanoparticle membranes still exhibited higher proton conductivities than the pristine acid-doped PPBI membrane.', '@', '@', 'Generally, two principle mechanisms of vehicle mechanism and Grotthuss mechanism (hopping) describe proton diffusion through the membrane [33]. It is possible that the bounded water par-ticipates by the Grotthuss mechanism, and the free water takes part mostly by vehicle mechanism [34]. Addition of silica-SO3H to the membranes increases the bounded water content in the membranes (Fig. 13). The bounded water facilitates the proton transport ability through the Grotthuss mechanism, originating by generation of a continuous proton conductive pathway. There-fore, the high proton conductivity of PPBI/modified nanoparticles can be attributed to the high bounded water content in the membrane.', 'Since the Grotthuss-type diffusion mechanism without assis-tance of the vehicle mechanism has been proposed for the protonconductionunderanhydrousenvironments[35,36], theprotonconductivityoftheacid-dopedPPBI/modified nanoparticlemembranescouldbesynergisticallyresulted from their modified nanoparticle contents and the acid-doping levels.', 'Consequently, the highest proton conductivity was obtained withtheacid-dopedPPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%membraneathigh humidity and low temperatures and PPBI/SiO2-PVI-15% mem-brane in high temperatures and low humidity, which possesses the moderate modified nanoparticles content and acid-doping level.', 'As it is seen in Fig. 9, either we use PSV-modified or un-modified nanoparticles, the increase in the amount of the nanoparticles leads to a decrease in the acid doping level, but when PVI-modified nanoparticles were used, doping level increased. Also, according to Fig. 8, water uptake of the membrane shows an increase when using higher amounts of modified nanoparticles. This increase in PSV-modified nanocomposite membranesishigherinPVI-modified one. Proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PSV-modified nanoparticles shows significant increase in comparison to PVI-modified ones in low temperature and high rel-ative humidity. But in high temperature and low relative humidity, proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PVI-modified nanoparticles is observed to be more than PSV-modified ones and even at 145 ◦C the proton conductivity of PPBI/SiO2-PVI 15% is more than PPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%. The exis-tence of modified nanoparticles in PPBI nanocomposite membranes results in high proton conductivity in three ways:', '@', '@', '1) With increase in water uptake 2) With increase in the amount of doping level and 3) With increase in the number of proton conductive functional groups such as sulfonic acid group.', 'In PSV-modified nanocomposite membranes, acid doping decreases while the water uptake and the number of sulfonic acid groups shows an increase. Consequently, high proton conductiv-ity can be a result of these changes. It should be mentioned that in temperatures higher than 100 ◦C and in very low relative humidity, water uptake of PSV-modified membranes decreases which leads to low efficiency of the sulfonic groups attached onto the surface of the nanoparticles which in turn results in a decrease in proton conduc-tivity in both membranes, but the increase in proton conductivity resulting from high doping level is significant and also the proton conductivity of PVI-modified nanocomposite membranes increase in high temperatures.', 'It is noteworthy that Nafion® 117 shows relatively low pro-ton conductivities under anhydrous conditions and almost lacks its proton conductivities at high temperatures. Comparing to Nafion®117 membranes, the high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicate that this membrane could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', '3.5. Mechanical properties', 'The mechanical properties of the PPBI-based membranes were measured. The stress–strain curves are shown in Fig. 14. Pristine PPBI membrane showed an elongation at break of 38%. Mod-ification of nanocomposites with SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles results in an increase in the tensile strengths and a subse-quent decrease in the elongations at break for the PPBI-based membranes. For PPBI/modified nanoparticles nanocomposites membranes (PPBI/modified nanocomposite consists of the PPBI and surface-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles by PVI and PSV chains and PPBI/unmodified nanocomposite includes PPBI and SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles without any treatment), the presence of ionic linkages between PPBI and silica particles can be assigned to their high Young’s modulus. Introduction of modified and un-modified nanoparticles increases the brittleness of the nanocomposite mem-branes with a decrease in their elongations at break. The effects of modified and unmodified nanoparticles on the elongations at break of the nanocomposite membranes were different. The decrease in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness were widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inorganic reinforcement [37–39]. Moreover, the ionic linkages in nanocomposite membranes prepared from modi-fied nanoparticles are higher than hydrogen bonding in PPBI/SiO2and PPBI/TiO2.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The brittleness of PPBI/TiO2 based nanocomposite membranes is higher than PPBI/SiO2 ones. The brittleness of membranes pre-pared from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI are less than PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV membranes which are perhaps due to more com-patibility of PVI grafted chains onto the nanoparticles surface with PPBI backbone.', 'Comparing the brittleness of the nanocomposite membranes of the PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/SiO2-PVI with PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, respectively indicates that the brittleness of the membranes prepared with modified SiO2 nanoparticles is less than the modified TiO2 ones.', '3.6. Morphological analysis', 'The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photographs of the PPBI/TiO2-PSV nanocomposite membranes surface with various amounts of TiO2-PSV are shown in Fig. 15.', 'A relatively flat surface is observed for thin membranes of pure PPBI (Fig. 15(a)). Fig. 15(b–d) display surface morphological properties of nanocomposite membranes having 5, 10 and 15% of TiO2-PSV, respectively.', 'As seen in Fig. 15, TiO2-PSV nanoparticles are dispersed homo-geneously in PPBI matrixes and are increased with increasing of the percentage of TiO2-PSV nanoparticles. Also the major amounts of nanoparticles size are in the range of nanoscale and the bigger parti-cles as evidence for the formation of aggregations are not observed. The size of the TiO2-PSV particles are about 25–40 nm and the size of particles on the surface of the nanocomposite are determined to be 30–60 nm.', 'Fig. 16(a) shows the SEM micrographs of the modified SiO2nanoparticles. If the interactions between silica nanoparticles are stronger than that of between PPBI molecules and silica nanoparticles, the silica nanoparticles are agglomerated together to form silica domains in micrometer sizes. The compatibility between PPBI and unmodified nanoparticles and the homogene-ity of the PPBI/SiO2 or PPBI/TiO2 membranes are somewhat poor [32].', 'However, the dispersion homogeneity of silica nanoparticles in PPBI membranes could be significantly improved with using surface modified nanoparticles as the additives. As shown in Fig. 16(b), the dispersion homogeneity of modified nanoparticles is observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2 nanocomposite membrane, which demonstrates high compatibility between PPBI polymer and PSV-SiO2 nanoparticles and the high dispersion abil-ity of PSV-SiO2 in PPBI matrix. Particle agglomeration is still not observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2-10%. The ionic linkages between PPBI and modified nanoparticles are contributed to their higher compatibility [32]. However, in nanocompos-ite membranes prepared from un-modified SiO2 nanoparticles, thedispersionofthenanoparticlesinpolymermatrixis not homogenous and probably aggregation has been formed (Fig. 16(c)).', '@', '@', '4. Conclusion', 'The nanocomposite PPBI-based membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified and un-modified TiO2 and SiO2nanoparticles. The thermal stability of the prepared nanocompos- ite membranes was similar to PPBI membrane. The water uptake of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from TiO2/PSV and SiO2/PSV nanoparticles were higher than other nanocomposite membranes. The acid doping level and proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes in dry conditions obtained from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI nanoparticles were the highest in comparison to PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV. Formation of nanocomposites with modified and un-modified nanoparticles resulted the increas-ing of tensile strengths. The decreasing in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness was widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inor-ganic reinforcement. The high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicated that this membrane could be utilized as a proton exchange membrane for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. M.-G.

And polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared through radical polymerization of 1-vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface-vinylated nanoparticles. The polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were utilized as a functional additive to prepare PPBI/polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. Imida-zole and sulfonated vinylbenzene groups on the surface of modified nanoparticles forming linkages with PPBI chains, improved the compatibility between PPBI and nanoparticles, and enhanced the mechanical strength of the prepared nanocomposite membranes. The prepared nanocomposite membranes showed higher water uptake and acid doping levels comparing to PPBI. Also, after acid doping with phosphoric acid, nanocomposite membranes exhibited enhanced proton conductivity in comparison to the pristine PPBI and PPBI/un-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. The enhancement in proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes resulted from modified SiO2 nanoparticles showed higher conductivity than modified TiO2 nanoparticles. The above results indicated that the PPBI/modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for medium temperature fuel cells.', '© 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang- ers [1–3]. Sulfonated polysulfone (PSF) [4], polyetheretherketone (PEEK) [5,6] and polybenzimidazoles (PBIs) [7–11] are among poly-mers which can be used as alternatives for Nafion in PEFCs.', 'Amongpolybenzimidazolederivatives,poly[2,2-5,5(m-phenylene)-bibenzimidazole](PBI),whichisalsocalled commercial polybenzimidazole have been used as a mem-brane material in PEMFCs. Having high chemical as well as thermal resistance and proton conductivity, polybenzimidazoles are great options to be used in the fuel cells with function at elevated temperatures above 100 ◦C [12].', 'PBIs should have enough proton conductivity so that it could be used as proton exchange membranes in the fuel cells. To achieve this purpose, they are usually doped with a sufficient acid like H3PO4 to an appropriate doping level [13]. Nanocomposite membranes are a new group of membranes which contain nanopar-ticles such as SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 and other compounds [14–21]. The introduction of nanoparticles into the membranes results in a considerable improvement in their features like mechani-cal properties, methanol permeability, but in some cases leads to a decrease in proton conductivity [22–24]. In order to over-come this problem, surface functionalized nanoparticles, which means various compounds with polar groups grafted chemically to the surface of the nanoparticles [25–28], were used. As men-tioned before, the numerous research works were done concerning grafting various compounds on the SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles which used for different purposes. However, in this work, we have used monomer bearing functional groups like imidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene which can improve the properties of pro-ton conductive membranes. These monomers are polymerized on the surface of the nanoparticles and as a consequence, they can more affect the properties of the membranes than while one functional group is grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. In addition, the polymerization of the selected monomers such as vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface of nanoparticle could cause more compatibility between nanopar-ticles and polymer matrix which finally improve the mechanical properties. In this work, nanocomposite membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles and newly synthesized polybenzimidazole was depicted poly[2,2-5,5-(m-pyrazolidene)-bibenzimidazole] (PPBI). Modification of the mentioned nanoparticles was performed by radical polymerization of some vinyl monomers such as sulfonated styrene and vinylim-idazole on the surface of the nanoparticles to which vinylic group was bounded covalently. Also, the effect of surface modification on the properties of the nanocomposite membranes such as pro-ton conductivity, mechanical properties and water uptake were studied.', '@', '@', '2.

These prove the existence of polymeric chains that are grafted onto the nanoparticle surface.', 'FT-IR spectra of the modified nanoparticles have been measured after complete washing and drying. To be sure of the chemical bonding of all chains (not physical) onto the particle surface, some un-modified nanoparticles were mixed with polymeric solutions of PVI and PSV and were stirred for 1 h. After filtration, the washing method used to wash the modified nanoparticles, was applied to the resulting powder as well. The FT-IR spectrum of the obtained powder did not show any absorbent bands related to PVI and PSV chains. The absorbent bands, which existed in the spectrum of mod-ified nanoparticles, were not observed in this spectrum. So, it was indicated that the polymeric chains have been attached to the par-ticles surface via covalent bonds.', '3.2. Thermal analysis', 'Thermogravimetric analysis diagrams of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 5. Weight loss in 85 ◦C can be related to the release of physically absorbed water. In un-modified nanoparticles, the minor weight loss in elevated temperatures can be attributed to the loss of hydroxyl groups of the particle surface attached by covalent bonds. Weight loss in modified nanoparticles could be a result of thermal degradation of the polymeric chains grafted to the surface of the nanoparti-cles. Also, the weight loss in 230–300 ◦C was due to the thermal decomposition of the sulfonate groups in the grafted PSV chains [30].', 'Thermograms of PVI modified nanocomposite with 5, 10 and 15% of TiO2 are shown in Fig. 6. As it is observed, the thermal prop-erties of the nanocomposites prepared with various amounts of TiO2 are almost similar. For this reason, in order to compare the thermal properties of other nanocomposites which prepared with modified nanoparticles having different monomers, only the TGA thermograms of nanocomposite containing of 10% (between 5% and 15%) modified nanoparticles are reported.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The remaining weight percentage in 850 ◦C is related to the modified TiO2 that is less than the added amount of PVI-modified TiO2 nanoparticles when the membrane was prepared. This decrease in weight in comparison with the theoretical amount could be related due to the degradation of the chains grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. Also, in order to obtain the par-ticular weight of the modified nanoparticles, specific amounts of modified and un-modified nanoparticles were weighed after and before complete burning out all the polymers. They were heated to temperatures about 1000 ◦C for 30 min and the obtained nanoparti-cles were weighed immediately. The difference between the weight of un-modified nanoparticles before and after heating shows the amount of lost water which was either physically absorbed or pro-duced from the condensation reaction of the hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticle surface. Also from the difference between the weight of modified nanoparticles before and after heating and consider- ing the weight of lost water, the percentage of the grafted polymer onto the nanoparticle surface was obtained. The obtained results and theoretical amounts are shown in Table 1. The amounts of the obtained results in all cases are more than theoretical values. This could be related to the presence of free water molecules and hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticles surface in which their values are not subtracted from theoretical values.', '@', '@', 'The diagrams of thermogravimetric analysis of both PPBI and nanocomposites prepared from the modified nanoparticles (10% w/w) are shown in Fig. 7. The weight loss observed in the tempera-ture range of 50–140 ◦C is a result of the release of water adsorbed into the membranes which is less significant in nanocomposites in comparison to pure membrane.', 'The second loss in weight, observed at the temperature range of 500–530 ◦C, is also attributed to the thermal degradation of poly-meric backbone of the nanocomposite membranes which is almost identical to the degradation temperature of pure PPBI. As a result, the addition of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles do not have any noticeable effect on thermal stability of the prepared nanocomposites.', 'As it is observed in Fig. 7, the degradation of PVI-modified nanoparticles occurs at 185 ◦C which is lower than the related tem-perature of PSV-modified ones. Therefore, the former one can be used in fuel cells with performance under 150 ◦C, but PSV-modified membrane is more suitable in high temperature fuel cells.', '@', '@', '@', '@', '3.3. Water uptake and doping level', 'Water uptake amount of nanocomposite membranes contain-ing 5, 10 and 15% of modified nanoparticles at 25 ◦C are shown in Fig. 8. Addition of silica nanoparticles to PPBI membranes increased their water uptakes due to the hygroscopic nature of SiO2 and TiO2nanoparticles. The sulfonic and imidazole groups in the nanopar-ticles increased the water uptake to a greater extent. The amount of water uptake for PPBI/TiO2-PSV, PPBI/SiO2-PSV, PPBI/TiO2-PVI and PPBI/SiO2-PVI are 21.6, 22.7, 20.4 and 21.9%, respectively. The effect of sulfonic acid groups of PSV chains grafted onto the nanoparticle surface on the water uptake is more than imidazole groups in PVI chains due to the higher hygroscopic properties of PSV comparing to PVI chains grafted on to the silica nanopar-ticle surface. The water uptake of PPBI/SiO2-PSV is higher than PPBI/TiO2-PSV which can be due to the further increase of the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles in comparison to TiO2 nanoparticle surface.', 'The PPBI-based membranes were doped with 85% H3PO4 to prepare the acid-doped membranes. Fig. 9 shows the acid-doping levels of the PPBI-based nanocomposite membranes. Acid-doping level (H3PO4 molecules per PPBI repeating unit) of pristine PPBI membrane was 13.5, which decreased to 11.8 for PPBI/SiO2, 12.0 for PPBI/SiO2-PSV, 11.7 for PPBI/TiO2 and 12.2 for PPBI/TiO2-PSV with 10% nanoparticle content and increased to 15.8 for PPBI/SiO2-PVI and 15.2 for PPBI/TiO2-PVI. Some of the amino groups in PPBI chains were blocked with the sulfonic acid groups of TiO2-PSV and SiO2-PSV, to decrease the binding ability of PPBI chains to H3PO4molecules.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'Among the prepared nanocomposites, the water uptake in PPBI/SiO2-PSV and acid doping in PPBI/SiO2-PVI were the most one. Even in the comparison of these membranes with the simi-lar ones which prepared from modified TiO2 such as PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, the amount of water uptake and doping level were higher. This shows that using modified SiO2 nanoparticles in fuel cells is more appropriate.', '3.4. Proton conductivity', 'The membrane was sandwiched between two stainless steel electrodes and pressed together by clamp. Then, the MEA (Mem-brane Electrolyte Assembly) was inputted in the steam autoclave equipped with temperature controller. For measurement of pro-ton conductivity, the steam autoclave supplied with steam from a house generator for exposure to saturated steam at desired temperature. As an example, for saturated steam the pressure cor-responding to 120 ◦C is 205 kPa. The time of exposure to saturated steam at 120 ◦C was 30 min that this value for temperature of 140 ◦C was increased to 50 min.', 'Fig. 10 shows the Nyquist plot and equivalent circuit of studied membranes at 25 ◦C and RH 100% for some membranes.', 'After fitting the EIS experimental data on the electrical equiv-alent circuit, the membrane proton conductivity was determined from the intercept of EIS data with real impedance Z′ axis (as the value of Rm element). In equivalent circuit, Rm presents the resis-tance of the polymer film between the two metallic electrodes toward charge carriers (i.e. H+). L1 presents the stray inductance of the setup wires. CPE1 presents the non-ideal double layer capac-itance of the film/metal electrode interface. Rct and W0 show the charge transfer resistance of the (possible) reactions at the film/metal electrode interface and the diffusion processes through the polymers film, respectively. The proton conductivities of the phosphoric acid-doped PPBI based nanocomposite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 11) at 100% relative humidity were presented as a function of temperatures up to 80 ◦C. The pro-ton conductivities of all membranes increased with increasing the operation temperature up to 80 ◦C. Addition of the un-modified nanoparticles showed a negative effect on the proton conductivities of nanocomposite membranes. Similar trends were also reported to other nanocomposite membranes like Nafion®/silica membranes and PBI/silica membranes [31].', '@', '@', 'On the other hand, comparing the pristine PPBI and Nafion®117 membranes, the relatively high proton conductivities of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles are noteworthy [32]. Li et al. have used sulfonated organosilica to modify Nafion® membranes and they found that the proton con-ductivities of the modified membranes were still lower than that of the neat Nafion® membrane.', 'The reduction in the proton conductivity was attributed to the silica-induced changes in the tortuous paths and in the dis-tribution of hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains. However, in this work an enhancing effect on the proton conductivity was observed with addition of PSV and PVI grafted nanoparticles to PPBI mem-brane. The sulfonic and imidazole groups of modified nanoparticles also contribute in the acid-doping effect to PPBI polymer so as to enhance the proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles. Moreover, the presence of modified nanoparticles induces proton conductive pathways lead-ing to an increase in the proton conductivities of PPBI/modified nanoparticles membranes [24].', 'The proton conductivities of the acid-doped nanocompos-ite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 12) were further studied at high temperatures under an anhydrous environment. All the PPBI/modified nanoparticle membranes still exhibited higher proton conductivities than the pristine acid-doped PPBI membrane.', '@', '@', 'Generally, two principle mechanisms of vehicle mechanism and Grotthuss mechanism (hopping) describe proton diffusion through the membrane [33]. It is possible that the bounded water par-ticipates by the Grotthuss mechanism, and the free water takes part mostly by vehicle mechanism [34]. Addition of silica-SO3H to the membranes increases the bounded water content in the membranes (Fig. 13). The bounded water facilitates the proton transport ability through the Grotthuss mechanism, originating by generation of a continuous proton conductive pathway. There-fore, the high proton conductivity of PPBI/modified nanoparticles can be attributed to the high bounded water content in the membrane.', 'Since the Grotthuss-type diffusion mechanism without assis-tance of the vehicle mechanism has been proposed for the protonconductionunderanhydrousenvironments[35,36], theprotonconductivityoftheacid-dopedPPBI/modified nanoparticlemembranescouldbesynergisticallyresulted from their modified nanoparticle contents and the acid-doping levels.', 'Consequently, the highest proton conductivity was obtained withtheacid-dopedPPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%membraneathigh humidity and low temperatures and PPBI/SiO2-PVI-15% mem-brane in high temperatures and low humidity, which possesses the moderate modified nanoparticles content and acid-doping level.', 'As it is seen in Fig. 9, either we use PSV-modified or un-modified nanoparticles, the increase in the amount of the nanoparticles leads to a decrease in the acid doping level, but when PVI-modified nanoparticles were used, doping level increased. Also, according to Fig. 8, water uptake of the membrane shows an increase when using higher amounts of modified nanoparticles. This increase in PSV-modified nanocomposite membranesishigherinPVI-modified one. Proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PSV-modified nanoparticles shows significant increase in comparison to PVI-modified ones in low temperature and high rel-ative humidity. But in high temperature and low relative humidity, proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PVI-modified nanoparticles is observed to be more than PSV-modified ones and even at 145 ◦C the proton conductivity of PPBI/SiO2-PVI 15% is more than PPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%. The exis-tence of modified nanoparticles in PPBI nanocomposite membranes results in high proton conductivity in three ways:', '@', '@', '1) With increase in water uptake 2) With increase in the amount of doping level and 3) With increase in the number of proton conductive functional groups such as sulfonic acid group.', 'In PSV-modified nanocomposite membranes, acid doping decreases while the water uptake and the number of sulfonic acid groups shows an increase. Consequently, high proton conductiv-ity can be a result of these changes. It should be mentioned that in temperatures higher than 100 ◦C and in very low relative humidity, water uptake of PSV-modified membranes decreases which leads to low efficiency of the sulfonic groups attached onto the surface of the nanoparticles which in turn results in a decrease in proton conduc-tivity in both membranes, but the increase in proton conductivity resulting from high doping level is significant and also the proton conductivity of PVI-modified nanocomposite membranes increase in high temperatures.', 'It is noteworthy that Nafion® 117 shows relatively low pro-ton conductivities under anhydrous conditions and almost lacks its proton conductivities at high temperatures. Comparing to Nafion®117 membranes, the high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicate that this membrane could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', '3.5. Mechanical properties', 'The mechanical properties of the PPBI-based membranes were measured. The stress–strain curves are shown in Fig. 14. Pristine PPBI membrane showed an elongation at break of 38%. Mod-ification of nanocomposites with SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles results in an increase in the tensile strengths and a subse-quent decrease in the elongations at break for the PPBI-based membranes. For PPBI/modified nanoparticles nanocomposites membranes (PPBI/modified nanocomposite consists of the PPBI and surface-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles by PVI and PSV chains and PPBI/unmodified nanocomposite includes PPBI and SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles without any treatment), the presence of ionic linkages between PPBI and silica particles can be assigned to their high Young’s modulus. Introduction of modified and un-modified nanoparticles increases the brittleness of the nanocomposite mem-branes with a decrease in their elongations at break. The effects of modified and unmodified nanoparticles on the elongations at break of the nanocomposite membranes were different. The decrease in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness were widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inorganic reinforcement [37–39]. Moreover, the ionic linkages in nanocomposite membranes prepared from modi-fied nanoparticles are higher than hydrogen bonding in PPBI/SiO2and PPBI/TiO2.', '@', '@', '@', '@', 'The brittleness of PPBI/TiO2 based nanocomposite membranes is higher than PPBI/SiO2 ones. The brittleness of membranes pre-pared from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI are less than PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV membranes which are perhaps due to more com-patibility of PVI grafted chains onto the nanoparticles surface with PPBI backbone.', 'Comparing the brittleness of the nanocomposite membranes of the PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/SiO2-PVI with PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, respectively indicates that the brittleness of the membranes prepared with modified SiO2 nanoparticles is less than the modified TiO2 ones.', '3.6. Morphological analysis', 'The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photographs of the PPBI/TiO2-PSV nanocomposite membranes surface with various amounts of TiO2-PSV are shown in Fig. 15.', 'A relatively flat surface is observed for thin membranes of pure PPBI (Fig. 15(a)). Fig. 15(b–d) display surface morphological properties of nanocomposite membranes having 5, 10 and 15% of TiO2-PSV, respectively.', 'As seen in Fig. 15, TiO2-PSV nanoparticles are dispersed homo-geneously in PPBI matrixes and are increased with increasing of the percentage of TiO2-PSV nanoparticles. Also the major amounts of nanoparticles size are in the range of nanoscale and the bigger parti-cles as evidence for the formation of aggregations are not observed. The size of the TiO2-PSV particles are about 25–40 nm and the size of particles on the surface of the nanocomposite are determined to be 30–60 nm.', 'Fig. 16(a) shows the SEM micrographs of the modified SiO2nanoparticles. If the interactions between silica nanoparticles are stronger than that of between PPBI molecules and silica nanoparticles, the silica nanoparticles are agglomerated together to form silica domains in micrometer sizes. The compatibility between PPBI and unmodified nanoparticles and the homogene-ity of the PPBI/SiO2 or PPBI/TiO2 membranes are somewhat poor [32].', 'However, the dispersion homogeneity of silica nanoparticles in PPBI membranes could be significantly improved with using surface modified nanoparticles as the additives. As shown in Fig. 16(b), the dispersion homogeneity of modified nanoparticles is observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2 nanocomposite membrane, which demonstrates high compatibility between PPBI polymer and PSV-SiO2 nanoparticles and the high dispersion abil-ity of PSV-SiO2 in PPBI matrix. Particle agglomeration is still not observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2-10%. The ionic linkages between PPBI and modified nanoparticles are contributed to their higher compatibility [32]. However, in nanocompos-ite membranes prepared from un-modified SiO2 nanoparticles, thedispersionofthenanoparticlesinpolymermatrixis not homogenous and probably aggregation has been formed (Fig. 16(c)).', '@', '@', '4. Conclusion', 'The nanocomposite PPBI-based membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified and un-modified TiO2 and SiO2nanoparticles. The thermal stability of the prepared nanocompos- ite membranes was similar to PPBI membrane. The water uptake of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from TiO2/PSV and SiO2/PSV nanoparticles were higher than other nanocomposite membranes. The acid doping level and proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes in dry conditions obtained from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI nanoparticles were the highest in comparison to PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV. Formation of nanocomposites with modified and un-modified nanoparticles resulted the increas-ing of tensile strengths. The decreasing in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness was widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inor-ganic reinforcement. The high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicated that this membrane could be utilized as a proton exchange membrane for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to acknowledge Dr. M.-G.
