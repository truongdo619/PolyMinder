Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25�C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 �C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 �10�4 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 �0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 �C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 �C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by significant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of �4 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers. �2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through proton', 'exchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Nafion�as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18].

We recently reported a class of ionomers based on aromatic hydrocarbon copolymers with high proton conductivity and excellent thermal mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states [22e29]. Sulfonated poly-arylenethioethersulfone(SPTES)copolymershavefollowing chemical structures (Fig. 1). SPTES copolymers including SPTES-50, SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80, have equivalent weight (EW) and IEC (mequiv./g) values of 610, 515, 459, 417, and 1.64, 1.94, 2.18, and 2.4, respectively [22]. They exhibited proton conductivity of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm respectively, at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity [22]. Their excellent proton conductivity at high temperatures combined with their high glass transition temperature (w200 �C) and mechanical stability (both in the dry and hydrated states) make them excellent potentials as high temperature PEM materials for fuel cells. SPTES-50 copolymer membrane has successfully been fabricated to membrane electrode assemblies and exhibited polarization curves and durability up to 400 h [29]. Their successful operations at 90e100 �C were limited by boiling point of water (100 �C at 1 atm). Replacing water molecules with heterocycles such as imidazolium where the charge carrier has a very low vapor pressure can result in proton conductivity at higher temperatures. Despite excellent electrochemical properties, excessive water uptake of SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes provide difficulties to be made as membrane electrode assembly [22,27] The proton transport and performance of SPTES copolymers highly depend on the presence of water molecules. In addition to the number of sulfonic groups, their acidity (pKa) ability to dissociate water molecules to proton, water activity coefficient, and number of water molecules associated with each sulfonic group, the supermolecular structure of the hydro-phobic and hydrophilic phases is also defined by polymer chain characteristics such as chain persistent length, and presence of sulfonic group on the backbone or in the side chains. We reported the presence of ionic nanodomains containing water molecules in the SPTES-70 using in-situ x-ray scattering [27]. The morphology and the nanostructure of SPTES-50 were approximated by corre-lated polydisperse spherical aggregates and a larger scale water domain network and were quantified by modeling of the SANS spectra with polydisperse hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [29]. This study reports the nanostructure and morphology of sulfonated polyarylenethioethersulfone (SPTES) copolymer membranes which is directly related to the proton transport through the membrane in terms of their degree of sulfonation and temperature dependency.', '2. Materials and methods', '2.1. Materials', 'Visually observed defect free films of SPTES copolymers were prepared by dissolving the purified copolymer in dimethyl acet-amide (DMAc, Sigma Aldrich) (5e10 wt%) filtering, placing in a flat dish in a vacuum oven with a gradual temperature rise to 100 �C for 24 h and 120 �C for 2 h. The resulting uniform flat films were immersed for 2 h in deionized water and dried under vacuum (24 h, 80 �C) after they were acidified in sulfuric acid (4 M, 24 h) to ensure complete conversion of sulfonic groups to their protonated forms.', '2.2.

Hydrated membranes were placed in demountable 1 mm thick titanium liquid cells filled with D2O after equilibrium in D2O (24 h). Scattered intensities were reduced, corrected for the transmission and background and placed on absolute scale. Then, circularly averaged to produce absolute scale scattering intensity, I(q), as a function of the wave vector, q, where q ¼ (4p/l)sin(q/2) and q is the scattering angle. Calculations were performed using Igor Pro�software [30,31]. USANS experiments covered a q-range of 0.00005 < q (Å�1) < 0.01, corresponding to a real-space length scale of 0.1 microne10 micron.', '3. Results and discussions', '3.1. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 25 �C', 'SPTES copolymers have high proton conductivity at high relative humidities and elevated temperatures; e.g. 65 �C and 85% RH of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers, respectively [27]. The degree of sulfonation increases for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6%, respectively. SPTES-50 copolymer has the lowest the degree of sulfonation and SPTES-80 copolymer has the highest degree of sulfonation in this class of copolymers [22,27]. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers at 25 �C show a scattering behavior of a two phase structure (Fig. 2a). The contribution of sulfonic groups to the scattering is considered to be negligible due to their small volume compared to the polymer and the water phase volume. It was visually observed that membranes do not dissociate when fully hydrated in the examined temperature. It was also determined by weight measurement that the membranes maintain the weight after deswelling. Therefore, the hydrophobic polymeric structure is the supporting network even at high water content and increased temperatures. Fig. 2a presents enhanced scattering intensity data (vertically shifted) for the hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copol-ymer membranes in the order of 20X, 1000X, and 2 �105X for the clarity of data presentation. The absolute scale scattering intensities in the medium q range of 0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1 are almost in the same intensity range for all SPTES copolymers. The high q scattering spectra for all copolymers exhibit a feature which is attributed to the presence of ionic domains containing water molecules. According to the scattering results, the morphology of all hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C can be approximated as correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates with liquid-like ordering (P.Y. ordering) and a power law decay [29]. The scattering data for the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C were compared and quantified using polydisperse (Schulz polydispersity) hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [32e34] and a low q power law decay [29].

Yoonessi et al. / Polymer 52 (2011) 5615e56215616', 'clarity and completeness of the SPTES series analysis [29]. Fig. 2b shows the experimental scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 25 �C compared with the theoretical calculations of the model (solid line). The results of the comparison of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes scattering data with the model are summarized in Table 1. According to this modeling the domain radius increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 13.45,14.9,15.4, and 16.9 Å for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes. The hard sphere packing density increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 19.8%, 23%, 25%, 29% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. This could indicate that ionic domains are capable of holding more water molecules with the presence of more sulfonic groups on the polymer backbone (increasing the degree of sulfonation). The high-q scattering spectra exhibits onset of a peak formation when the degree of sulfonation was increased to 71.6% for SPTES-80 copolymer. Pres-ence of scattering maxima can be due to the scattering from an ordered structure (periodicity) or the oscillations resulted from the structural factor effects or the excluded volume effect arising from short range liquid-like ordering. The onset of peak formation is attributed to the excluded volume effects related to the liquid-like ordering [33e35]. The low-q power law decay of nearly �3 was observed for all SPTES copolymers in the range of 1 �10�4 < q (1/ Å) < 3 �10�3. The power law decay of �3 is attributed to the presence of interacting three-dimensional fractal morphology. In addition, a Guinier plateau [35] was present for the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer at the very low q (q (1/Å) < 9 �10�5). This is in addition to the nearly identical scattering intensity in the inter-mediate q-range (0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1). It can be concluded that the change in the degree of sulfonation had little or no effect on the intermediate and low angle scattering wave vector. The low-q power law decay was nearly �3 �0.1 for all SPTES copolymers. The presence of sharp interface between hydrophobic and hydro-philic domains was deduced from the power law decay of �4 at large angle wave vectors for all hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes. All scattering data presented in Fig. 2a shows a power slope of �3.85 to �4.15 which is approximated as w �4. The presence of Porod behavior (decay of �4) has been attributed to the two immiscible phase with a sharp boundary [35e37]. This shows that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are separated with a distinct interface containing sulfonic groups. Presence of a plateau in the scattering spectra is characteristics of isolated scatterers [35]. The radius of gyration (Rg) of the isolated scatterers can be approximated by IðqÞ ¼ I0expðð�q2R2gÞ=3Þ, where I0 is the extrapolated zero scattering intensity (Guinier approxi-mation) [35]. Presence of the Guinier plateau in the q range of 4.3 �10�5 < q (1/Å) < 8.2 �10�5 for SPTES-80 copolymer suggests segregation of the isolated large scale hydrophilic water pockets when the degree of sulfonation increased to 71.6%.

Fig. 3 exhibits the scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. The inter-mediate scattering intensity decreased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes start to form scattering maxima at high q range when the degree of sulfonation increased. This indicated the increase in the excluded volume due to the increase in the volume of the scatterers at higher degree of sulfonation and increased temperature (55 �C). The presence of scattering maxima is more significant for SPTES-70 copolymer and SPTES-80 copolymer with 63.3 and 71.6% degree of sulfonation. The large angle scattering feature shows scattering maxima at qmax of 0.103 and 0.1108 1/Å for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers which correspond to spatial characteristics lengths (l ¼ 2p/qmax) of 60.97 and 56.7 Å due to concentration fluctuations of hydrated domains (hard spheres). The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes changed significantlywith increasing degree of sulfonation. This indicates a substantial change in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology with increasing degree of sulfonation at 55 �C which is more pronounced for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers (degree of sulfonation 63.3 and 71.6%, respectively). Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are segregated distinctly by the sulfonic groups at the interface which is repre-sented by the Porod behavior, asymptotic behavior of w �4 for all SPTES copolymers [35e37]. The morphology of these membranes is complex and controlled by interfacial phenomena. The number of sulfonic groups per repeat unit volume and their acidity com-plemented with the chain persistent length and chain mobility are governing factors in the formed morphology. This study approxi-mates the morphology of the fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55 �C are approximated as spherical nanodomains containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering similar to their morphology at 25 �C. It is also proposed that this morphology changedtofractalmorphologywithincreasing temperature (increasing the intermediate scattering decay). The domain radius and the sphere packing density were increased from 26.4 Å and 28% for SPTES-50 copolymer to 32 Å and 33% for SPTES-60copolymerwhiletheintermediatescatteringintensity decreased. The domain radius and packing density of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane increased from 13.45 Å and 19.8% to 26.4 Å and 28% when the temperature increased from 25 �C to 55 �C with this approximation. The same increasing trend of 14.9 Åe32 Å for the average domain radius and 23%e33% of the sphere packing density was observed. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane compared to the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane is attributed to the disruption of the large scale morphology. The low q power law decay of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane was close to the decay of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane. The increase in the degree of sulfonation of SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymers from 54.9, to 63.3 and 71.6% resulted in a shift in the position of the high q scattering maxima of the hydrated membranes toward the large angle scattering regime. This peak formation is more prominent for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copoly-mers with higher sulfonation degree. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering intensity in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70 and', '-80 copolymers is attributed to the loss of the large scale water network, intermediate fractal morphology within the polymer and onset of a morphology change to a two large scale phase morphology. The closed domain morphology of polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with fractal network were present for fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55�C (Figs. 3 and 4a). However, substantialchangesinthemorphologyoffullyhydrated membranes occurred when the degree of sulfonation is increased to 63.3 and 71.6% for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers at higher temperature of 55 �C. Combination of high temperature, high density of sulfonic groups, and significant amount of water mole-cules within the polymer backbone could have resulted in the coalescence of the small spherical ionic domains and fractal water network into a larger scale bicontinuous network of intermeshed hydrophobic and hydrophilic morphology for fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane at 55 �C. The bicontinuous model origi-nally proposed for micro-emulsion of two immiscible phases of water and oil with comparable amount based on Landau theory [38,39]. This model describes two irregular shapes with distinct boundary and has been used for intermesh of hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure when the particle shape is not well-defined [40,41]. This model proposes I(q) ¼ (a2þc1q þ c2q2)�1 for a2 > 0, c1 < 0, and c2 > 0, a single broad scattering maxima, and power law decay of �4 at large scattering angles. Two characteristics lengths of d and x are deduced from this analysis having a2, c1, and c2[39,40], d is the domain periodicity or interdomain distance and x is the correlation length which has been attributed to the dispersion of d. According to this theory, c1 is negative due to the surfactant. The absolute values of c1 and the ratio of x/d should increase with increasing surfactant. The specific internal surface area can be derived from the ratio of S/V ¼ 44(1�4)/x [38,39]. The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane has a low-q upturn, a lower intermediate scattering intensity compared to the hydrated SPTES-60 and SPTES-50 copolymers, and a large angle maxima followed by a power law decay of �4. This indicates the onset of the coalescence of the ionic aggregates, disruption of the fractal water network, and the formation of the two irregular large scale bicontinuous phase morphology.

High q range maxima position of hydrated SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 shifts toward higher q with increasing degree of sulfonation.', 'M. Yoonessi et al. / Polymer 52 (2011) 5615e56215618', 'spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 55 �C was compared with the T.S. bicontinuous model (Fig. 4b). This simulation resulted in a periodicity, d, of 59.9 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima position, 60.97 Å. According to this simulation, the correlation length (x) is 31.14 Å. The medium-q range scattering still exhibits the larger scale morphology which is not completely converted to the bi-continuous phase morphology. However, they are partially collapsed characterized by a lower scattering intensity in the intermediate q range. The high q maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 is approximated as bicontinuous morphology. The low and medium q (q < 0.037 1/Å) scattering spectra of the SPTES 70 is due to the presence of fractal network of waters which have not coalesce yet. The scattering spectra of the SPTES-80 copolymer are consistent with a bicontinuous two phase structure of irregular shapes with sulfonic groups as interfacial ionic region. The scattering experi-mental data of the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was compared with this model (q > 0.015 1/Å), (Fig. 4c and Table 2). The periodicity of the water domains (or hydrophobic domains), d, predicted by this model is w54 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima (qmax), 56.7 Å. This value is the distance between water domains. The correlation length (x) obtained from this model is 37.86 Å which is a measure of dispersion. The distance between the water phases, periodicity, was decreased from 59.9 Å to 54 Å with increasing degree of sulfona-tion. The correlation length, x, was increased from 31.14 Å to 37.86 Å when the degree of sulfonation increased. Increasing the interfacial area results in an increase in the x/d ratio. The presence of the upturn in the low range of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 at 55 �C (Fig. 4b and c) is attributed to the fractal morphology of the large scale features.', '3.3. Discussions', 'Scattering data of series of SPTES membranes were obtained in the full hydration state with increasing the sulfonation degree in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. Complete study was performed to provide understanding membranes morphology with increasing the temperature of the hydrated membranes from 25 �C to 55 �C.

This model predicted that the increase in the degree of sulfonation resulted in an increase in the radius of ionic domains and an increase in the volume packing density of water in the aggregates. It was assumed that the same morphology of polydisperse correlated spherical ionic domains were present in the SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymers when the temperature increased to 55 �C. Increase in the degree of sulfonation for fully hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer at 55 �C led to a substantial reorganization of the membrane morphology which was described by a bi-continuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic network.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to thank the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Nano-structured andBiological Materials Branch forfunding this research.

China     (Received: 21 May, 2007; published: 10 September, 2007)', 'Abstract: We reported a chemical approach for the in-situ preparation of  conducting polyaniline (PANI)/Fe2O3 composite dispersions using dodecylbenzene  sulfonic (DBSA) acid both as dopant and surfactant. The PANI/Fe2O3 composite  dispersions were characterized by X-ray diffraction, UV-vis and FT-IR spectra and  conductivity measurement. The dispersions showed good stability and existed  without precipitate for at least half a year. The gas-sensing behavior of the  composite film to 100 ppm of NH3 was studied through monitoring the change of  the resistance. Keywords: PANI/Fe2O3 composite, dispersions, dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid', 'Introduction', 'Recently, polymeric composites containing metal oxides have attracted a great deal  of attention from researchers because they frequently exhibit unexpected hybrid  properties synergistically derived from both components [1-4]. Meanwhile, they  exhibit interesting properties with many applications such as quantum electronic  devices, gas sensors, capacitors, conducting paints and rechargeable batteries [5-8].  Composites of polyaniline (PANI) have been widely studied in view of their unique  electrical, dielectrical, optical and optoelectrical properties in addition to their easy  preparation and excellent environmental stability [9-12]. However, the poor solubility  limits their application as conducting materials. To overcome this obstacle,  functionalized protonic acids such as dedecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) or  camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) have been used to dope PANI and the obtained  conducting products were soluble in many kinds of solvents [13-14].', 'On the other hand, composite of PANI and iron oxides (Fe2O3 or Fe3O4) has been  extensively investigated because of their unique magnetic properties and application  prospects in technology [15-24]. But most of the composites were in powder state;  therefore, the processes to prepare film for application in devices are complicated. In  our experiment, we prepare the conducting PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions in  aqueous solution by one step, and the so-obtained PANI/Fe2O3 composite  dispersions can be directly used to prepare conducting films and hence make  different devices.', 'In our former work, we have investigated the formation of the PANI dispersions under  different preparation conductions by changing the concentration of surfactant, aniline,  acid and the ratio of aniline to ammonium persulphate (APS) [25]. In this study, we', '1', 'chose the optimum conditions considering the above factors to prepare the  PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions by in-situ polymerization using DBSA both as  dopant and surfactant. The dispersions of PANI/Fe2O3 composite could exist without  any precipitate for at least half a year. In addition, it can be diluted by distilled water  for many times without generation of precipitate, indicating their high stability or  nearly solution characteristic. The structure and conductivity of the composite was  studied by X-ray, UV-vis and FT-IR spectra, and four-probe technology. The gas-sensing behavior of the film prepared by directly spinning the dispersions on silicon  chip was studied.   Results and discussion  Formation', 'As for the formation of the dispersions, we assumed that the Fe2O3 particles were  dispersed in water aqueous solution and it would act as ‘seed’ to induce the  polymerization of aniline. In our experiment, the Fe2O3 particles were homogeneously  dispersed in the reaction system because DBSA with hydrophilic group acted as  surfactant. Then the aniline monomer contacted with Fe2O3 nearly at the same time,  which could accelerate the induction time of polymerization [26]. This effect could be  observed by monitoring the change of the solution temperature as shown in Fig. 1.  From Fig. 1, we can see that the time for the seed polymerization to start was about  300 s (Fig. 1b) while without Fe2O3 particles was about 3300 s along (Fig. 1a).', 'Fig. 1. Temperature change during the induction time.', 'XRD pattern', 'The XRD pattern of PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions is shown in Fig. 2. In the  pattern, the 2θ at 35.6, 43.4, 53.6, 57.3, and 62.8 o are contributed to γ-Fe2O3, and  33.08, 40.78 and 49.42 o are related to α-Fe2O3. The broad peaks at about 19.9 and  24.1 o are characteristic peaks of PANI [27]. These results indicate that the', '2', 'PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions contain two different phases of the Fe2O3  particles, and the PANI is amorphous in the composite.', 'Fig. 2. XRD pattern of the PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions.   UV-vis spectra', 'Fig. 3. UV-vis spectra of PANI (a) and PANI/Fe2O3 composite (b) dispersions.    The UV-vis absorption spectra of PANI and the PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions  are shown in Fig. 3. A typical absorption spectrum of PANI dispersions has three', '3', 'distinct absorption peaks at 351, 436, and 757 nm, respectively (Fig. 3a). The peak  at 351 nm arises from π-π* electron transition within benzenoid segments, the peak  at 436 nm is due to the polaron state and the wide peak at 757 nm is related to the  doping level [28]. Compared to the PANI dispersions, the absorption peak of  PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions show little difference, for example, the peak at  757 nm shifts to 746 nm (Fig. 3b). The shift may be originated from the decreasing  doping level by the addition of Fe2O3.  FT-IR spectra', 'The FT-IR spectra of PANI and PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions are shown in Fig.  4. From Fig. 4a, we can find the characteristic peaks of PANI: the peak at 684 cm-1 is  usually assigned to the C-H out of plane bending in 1, 2 ring in intrinsic PANI; the  peak at 1083 cm-1 stands for the C-H aromatic in-plane bending on 1, 4 ring; the  peak at 1183 cm-1 may be assigned to the carbon skeleton, and the peak of 1311 cm-', '1 is contributed to C-N stretching mode. The strong peak at 1459 cm-1 is related to  C=C stretching mode of the benzenoid ring and a weak peak of quionoid ring at 1548  cm-1 means the high doping degree of the PANI [29]. And from Fig. 4b, we can see  that when the Fe2O3 particles present in the dispersion, the intensity of the peak at  1459 cm-1 is decreased and shift to 1461 cm-1, which represents the decrease of  doping degree of the PANI. There may be some interaction between the lone pair  electrons of N atom in PANI chains with 3d orbit of Fe atom, which could reduce the  energy level interval of aromatic nucleus. This also caused the UV-vis absorption  band of composite dispersions to have a red shift [30].', 'Fig. 4. FT-IR spectra of PANI (a) and PANI/Fe2O3 composite (b) dispersions.   Conductivity', 'Table 1 shows the conductivity values measured by using four-probe technology at  25 0C. Compared to pure PANI, the conductivity of PANI/Fe2O3 composite with Fe2O3  content of 0.05 g increases from 0.98 to 1.07μS/cm. This may be attributed to the  doping effect associated with Fe2O3 particles that are believed to help induce the  formation of a more efficient network for change transport, thus enhancing the', '4', 'conductivity of the composite [31]. However, with increasing the content of Fe2O3, the  relative contents of the conducting polymer are decreased, resulting in the decrease  of the corresponding conductivity. The decrease may be attributed to two factors: (a)  the insulating behavior of the Fe2O3 particles in the core of the composites; (b) a  decrease of doping degree as the UV-vis and FT-IR spectra show [32].    Tab. 1. Conductivity values of the composites with different contents of Fe2O3  particles.', 'Content of Fe2O3Conductivity (μS/cm )', '0 0.98', '0.05 1.07', '0.1 0.78', '0.2 0.69', '0.465 0.33', 'Gas-sensing behavior', 'The gas-sensing behavior of PANI/Fe2O3 composite film to 100 ppm of NH3 is shown  in Fig. 5. The y-axis is the normalized resistance (R- R0/R0), where R0 is the initial  resistance of the composite film before exposure to NH3 at t = 0 and R is the time  dependent resistance of the film exposed to the test gas.', '020406080100120', '0', '20', '40', '60', '80', '100', '(R-R0)/R0', 'Time (s)', 'Fig. 5.

The response time of the composite film is 40 s. It can be applied to the detection of  ammonia, and the further study of the sensitivity to NH3 and other gases is under  way.', '5', 'Stability', 'The stability of the dispersions with different content of Fe2O3 particles was studied.  When the content of Fe2O3 particles in the dispersions was lower than 0.05 g, the  dispersions show good stability and existed without precipitate at least half a year.  However, when the content was beyond 0.05 g, there were some precipitates on the  bottom of the dispersion and the quantity of the precipitates increased with the  content of Fe2O3.   Conclusions', 'PANI/Fe2O3 dispersions were prepared using DBSA both as dopant and surfactant.  The XRD, UV-vis and FT-IR characterization indicated that there is some interaction  between the PANI and Fe2O3. The conductivity of the dispersions increased when a  little of Fe2O3 particles were added and decreased in line when a great quantity of  Fe2O3 were added. The dispersions showed good stability and existed without  precipitate for at least half a year. A film were prepared by directly spinning the  PANI/Fe2O3 dispersions on a chip of silicon to study the gas-sensing of100ppm NH3;  the response time is only 40 s and further study of the sensitivity to the NH3 is under  way.    Experimental  Materials', 'Aniline was freshly distilled under reduced pressure and other chemicals were used  as received without further purification. Fe2O3 particles were synthesized by  coprecipitation.    Preparation of PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersion', 'PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions were prepared using an in-situ polymerization  method. A typical experiment was done as follows: 0.465 g of aniline was dispersed  into 100 ml of DBSA aqueous solution (0.2 M) under stirring, after which 0.1 g of  Fe2O3 was added into the above solution under ultrasonic. APS in powder state was  then added into the mixture solution. The dispersions of PANI/Fe2O3 composite were  obtained after stirring for 1 h. The PANI dispersions were prepared by the same  approach in absence of Fe2O3. Acetone damaging dispersions were centrifuged and  washed with distilled water, ethanol and acetone three times, respectively. The  resulting powder were dried under reduced pressure at room temperature and then  used for XRD and conductivity measurements.   Characterization', 'The composite dispersions was spun onto a chip of silicon and dried under 60 oC in  order to remove the solvent and form a film for the UV-vis and FT-IR spectra  measurement and study NH3 gas-sensing behavior. UV-vis and FT-IR spectra were  recorded on a UV 3100 spectrometer and on FT-IR-8400s (Shimadzu) spectrometer,  respectively. The conductivity measurements were made by the conventional four-probe (SDY-5) method on pressed pellets of the composite powders prepared at  ambient temperature (25 oC). The gas-sensing behavior, which could be reflected by  the resistance change of the resulting PANI/Fe2O3 composite film upon exposure to  100 ppm of NH3, was monitored with a digital multimeter (DT9205).', '6', 'References', '[1] Su S.J.; Kuramoto N.

R.  China  2 Faculty of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130023, P. R.  China     (Received: 21 May, 2007; published: 10 September, 2007)', 'Abstract: We reported a chemical approach for the in-situ preparation of  conducting polyaniline (PANI)/Fe2O3 composite dispersions using dodecylbenzene  sulfonic (DBSA) acid both as dopant and surfactant. The PANI/Fe2O3 composite  dispersions were characterized by X-ray diffraction, UV-vis and FT-IR spectra and  conductivity measurement. The dispersions showed good stability and existed  without precipitate for at least half a year. The gas-sensing behavior of the  composite film to 100 ppm of NH3 was studied through monitoring the change of  the resistance. Keywords: PANI/Fe2O3 composite, dispersions, dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid', 'Introduction', 'Recently, polymeric composites containing metal oxides have attracted a great deal  of attention from researchers because they frequently exhibit unexpected hybrid  properties synergistically derived from both components [1-4]. Meanwhile, they  exhibit interesting properties with many applications such as quantum electronic  devices, gas sensors, capacitors, conducting paints and rechargeable batteries [5-8].  Composites of polyaniline (PANI) have been widely studied in view of their unique  electrical, dielectrical, optical and optoelectrical properties in addition to their easy  preparation and excellent environmental stability [9-12]. However, the poor solubility  limits their application as conducting materials. To overcome this obstacle,  functionalized protonic acids such as dedecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) or  camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) have been used to dope PANI and the obtained  conducting products were soluble in many kinds of solvents [13-14].', 'On the other hand, composite of PANI and iron oxides (Fe2O3 or Fe3O4) has been  extensively investigated because of their unique magnetic properties and application  prospects in technology [15-24]. But most of the composites were in powder state;  therefore, the processes to prepare film for application in devices are complicated. In  our experiment, we prepare the conducting PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions in  aqueous solution by one step, and the so-obtained PANI/Fe2O3 composite  dispersions can be directly used to prepare conducting films and hence make  different devices.', 'In our former work, we have investigated the formation of the PANI dispersions under  different preparation conductions by changing the concentration of surfactant, aniline,  acid and the ratio of aniline to ammonium persulphate (APS) [25]. In this study, we', '1', 'chose the optimum conditions considering the above factors to prepare the  PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions by in-situ polymerization using DBSA both as  dopant and surfactant. The dispersions of PANI/Fe2O3 composite could exist without  any precipitate for at least half a year. In addition, it can be diluted by distilled water  for many times without generation of precipitate, indicating their high stability or  nearly solution characteristic. The structure and conductivity of the composite was  studied by X-ray, UV-vis and FT-IR spectra, and four-probe technology. The gas-sensing behavior of the film prepared by directly spinning the dispersions on silicon  chip was studied.   Results and discussion  Formation', 'As for the formation of the dispersions, we assumed that the Fe2O3 particles were  dispersed in water aqueous solution and it would act as ‘seed’ to induce the  polymerization of aniline. In our experiment, the Fe2O3 particles were homogeneously  dispersed in the reaction system because DBSA with hydrophilic group acted as  surfactant. Then the aniline monomer contacted with Fe2O3 nearly at the same time,  which could accelerate the induction time of polymerization [26]. This effect could be  observed by monitoring the change of the solution temperature as shown in Fig. 1.  From Fig. 1, we can see that the time for the seed polymerization to start was about  300 s (Fig. 1b) while without Fe2O3 particles was about 3300 s along (Fig. 1a).', 'Fig. 1. Temperature change during the induction time.', 'XRD pattern', 'The XRD pattern of PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions is shown in Fig. 2. In the  pattern, the 2θ at 35.6, 43.4, 53.6, 57.3, and 62.8 o are contributed to γ-Fe2O3, and  33.08, 40.78 and 49.42 o are related to α-Fe2O3. The broad peaks at about 19.9 and  24.1 o are characteristic peaks of PANI [27]. These results indicate that the', '2', 'PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions contain two different phases of the Fe2O3  particles, and the PANI is amorphous in the composite.', 'Fig. 2. XRD pattern of the PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions.   UV-vis spectra', 'Fig. 3. UV-vis spectra of PANI (a) and PANI/Fe2O3 composite (b) dispersions.    The UV-vis absorption spectra of PANI and the PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions  are shown in Fig. 3. A typical absorption spectrum of PANI dispersions has three', '3', 'distinct absorption peaks at 351, 436, and 757 nm, respectively (Fig. 3a). The peak  at 351 nm arises from π-π* electron transition within benzenoid segments, the peak  at 436 nm is due to the polaron state and the wide peak at 757 nm is related to the  doping level [28]. Compared to the PANI dispersions, the absorption peak of  PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions show little difference, for example, the peak at  757 nm shifts to 746 nm (Fig. 3b). The shift may be originated from the decreasing  doping level by the addition of Fe2O3.  FT-IR spectra', 'The FT-IR spectra of PANI and PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions are shown in Fig.  4. From Fig. 4a, we can find the characteristic peaks of PANI: the peak at 684 cm-1 is  usually assigned to the C-H out of plane bending in 1, 2 ring in intrinsic PANI; the  peak at 1083 cm-1 stands for the C-H aromatic in-plane bending on 1, 4 ring; the  peak at 1183 cm-1 may be assigned to the carbon skeleton, and the peak of 1311 cm-', '1 is contributed to C-N stretching mode. The strong peak at 1459 cm-1 is related to  C=C stretching mode of the benzenoid ring and a weak peak of quionoid ring at 1548  cm-1 means the high doping degree of the PANI [29]. And from Fig. 4b, we can see  that when the Fe2O3 particles present in the dispersion, the intensity of the peak at  1459 cm-1 is decreased and shift to 1461 cm-1, which represents the decrease of  doping degree of the PANI. There may be some interaction between the lone pair  electrons of N atom in PANI chains with 3d orbit of Fe atom, which could reduce the  energy level interval of aromatic nucleus. This also caused the UV-vis absorption  band of composite dispersions to have a red shift [30].', 'Fig. 4. FT-IR spectra of PANI (a) and PANI/Fe2O3 composite (b) dispersions.   Conductivity', 'Table 1 shows the conductivity values measured by using four-probe technology at  25 0C. Compared to pure PANI, the conductivity of PANI/Fe2O3 composite with Fe2O3  content of 0.05 g increases from 0.98 to 1.07μS/cm. This may be attributed to the  doping effect associated with Fe2O3 particles that are believed to help induce the  formation of a more efficient network for change transport, thus enhancing the', '4', 'conductivity of the composite [31]. However, with increasing the content of Fe2O3, the  relative contents of the conducting polymer are decreased, resulting in the decrease  of the corresponding conductivity. The decrease may be attributed to two factors: (a)  the insulating behavior of the Fe2O3 particles in the core of the composites; (b) a  decrease of doping degree as the UV-vis and FT-IR spectra show [32].

The y-axis is the normalized resistance (R- R0/R0), where R0 is the initial  resistance of the composite film before exposure to NH3 at t = 0 and R is the time  dependent resistance of the film exposed to the test gas.', '020406080100120', '0', '20', '40', '60', '80', '100', '(R-R0)/R0', 'Time (s)', 'Fig. 5.

The response time of the composite film is 40 s. It can be applied to the detection of  ammonia, and the further study of the sensitivity to NH3 and other gases is under  way.', '5', 'Stability', 'The stability of the dispersions with different content of Fe2O3 particles was studied.  When the content of Fe2O3 particles in the dispersions was lower than 0.05 g, the  dispersions show good stability and existed without precipitate at least half a year.  However, when the content was beyond 0.05 g, there were some precipitates on the  bottom of the dispersion and the quantity of the precipitates increased with the  content of Fe2O3.   Conclusions', 'PANI/Fe2O3 dispersions were prepared using DBSA both as dopant and surfactant.  The XRD, UV-vis and FT-IR characterization indicated that there is some interaction  between the PANI and Fe2O3. The conductivity of the dispersions increased when a  little of Fe2O3 particles were added and decreased in line when a great quantity of  Fe2O3 were added. The dispersions showed good stability and existed without  precipitate for at least half a year. A film were prepared by directly spinning the  PANI/Fe2O3 dispersions on a chip of silicon to study the gas-sensing of100ppm NH3;  the response time is only 40 s and further study of the sensitivity to the NH3 is under  way.    Experimental  Materials', 'Aniline was freshly distilled under reduced pressure and other chemicals were used  as received without further purification. Fe2O3 particles were synthesized by  coprecipitation.    Preparation of PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersion', 'PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions were prepared using an in-situ polymerization  method. A typical experiment was done as follows: 0.465 g of aniline was dispersed  into 100 ml of DBSA aqueous solution (0.2 M) under stirring, after which 0.1 g of  Fe2O3 was added into the above solution under ultrasonic. APS in powder state was  then added into the mixture solution. The dispersions of PANI/Fe2O3 composite were  obtained after stirring for 1 h. The PANI dispersions were prepared by the same  approach in absence of Fe2O3. Acetone damaging dispersions were centrifuged and  washed with distilled water, ethanol and acetone three times, respectively. The  resulting powder were dried under reduced pressure at room temperature and then  used for XRD and conductivity measurements.   Characterization', 'The composite dispersions was spun onto a chip of silicon and dried under 60 oC in  order to remove the solvent and form a film for the UV-vis and FT-IR spectra  measurement and study NH3 gas-sensing behavior. UV-vis and FT-IR spectra were  recorded on a UV 3100 spectrometer and on FT-IR-8400s (Shimadzu) spectrometer,  respectively. The conductivity measurements were made by the conventional four-probe (SDY-5) method on pressed pellets of the composite powders prepared at  ambient temperature (25 oC). The gas-sensing behavior, which could be reflected by  the resistance change of the resulting PANI/Fe2O3 composite film upon exposure to  100 ppm of NH3, was monitored with a digital multimeter (DT9205).', '6', 'References', '[1] Su S.J.; Kuramoto N.

China     (Received: 21 May, 2007; published: 10 September, 2007)', 'Abstract: We reported a chemical approach for the in-situ preparation of  conducting polyaniline (PANI)/Fe2O3 composite dispersions using dodecylbenzene  sulfonic (DBSA) acid both as dopant and surfactant. The PANI/Fe2O3 composite  dispersions were characterized by X-ray diffraction, UV-vis and FT-IR spectra and  conductivity measurement. The dispersions showed good stability and existed  without precipitate for at least half a year. The gas-sensing behavior of the  composite film to 100 ppm of NH3 was studied through monitoring the change of  the resistance. Keywords: PANI/Fe2O3 composite, dispersions, dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid', 'Introduction', 'Recently, polymeric composites containing metal oxides have attracted a great deal  of attention from researchers because they frequently exhibit unexpected hybrid  properties synergistically derived from both components [1-4]. Meanwhile, they  exhibit interesting properties with many applications such as quantum electronic  devices, gas sensors, capacitors, conducting paints and rechargeable batteries [5-8].  Composites of polyaniline (PANI) have been widely studied in view of their unique  electrical, dielectrical, optical and optoelectrical properties in addition to their easy  preparation and excellent environmental stability [9-12]. However, the poor solubility  limits their application as conducting materials. To overcome this obstacle,  functionalized protonic acids such as dedecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) or  camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) have been used to dope PANI and the obtained  conducting products were soluble in many kinds of solvents [13-14].', 'On the other hand, composite of PANI and iron oxides (Fe2O3 or Fe3O4) has been  extensively investigated because of their unique magnetic properties and application  prospects in technology [15-24]. But most of the composites were in powder state;  therefore, the processes to prepare film for application in devices are complicated. In  our experiment, we prepare the conducting PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions in  aqueous solution by one step, and the so-obtained PANI/Fe2O3 composite  dispersions can be directly used to prepare conducting films and hence make  different devices.', 'In our former work, we have investigated the formation of the PANI dispersions under  different preparation conductions by changing the concentration of surfactant, aniline,  acid and the ratio of aniline to ammonium persulphate (APS) [25]. In this study, we', '1', 'chose the optimum conditions considering the above factors to prepare the  PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions by in-situ polymerization using DBSA both as  dopant and surfactant. The dispersions of PANI/Fe2O3 composite could exist without  any precipitate for at least half a year. In addition, it can be diluted by distilled water  for many times without generation of precipitate, indicating their high stability or  nearly solution characteristic. The structure and conductivity of the composite was  studied by X-ray, UV-vis and FT-IR spectra, and four-probe technology. The gas-sensing behavior of the film prepared by directly spinning the dispersions on silicon  chip was studied.   Results and discussion  Formation', 'As for the formation of the dispersions, we assumed that the Fe2O3 particles were  dispersed in water aqueous solution and it would act as ‘seed’ to induce the  polymerization of aniline. In our experiment, the Fe2O3 particles were homogeneously  dispersed in the reaction system because DBSA with hydrophilic group acted as  surfactant. Then the aniline monomer contacted with Fe2O3 nearly at the same time,  which could accelerate the induction time of polymerization [26]. This effect could be  observed by monitoring the change of the solution temperature as shown in Fig. 1.  From Fig. 1, we can see that the time for the seed polymerization to start was about  300 s (Fig. 1b) while without Fe2O3 particles was about 3300 s along (Fig. 1a).', 'Fig. 1. Temperature change during the induction time.', 'XRD pattern', 'The XRD pattern of PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions is shown in Fig. 2. In the  pattern, the 2θ at 35.6, 43.4, 53.6, 57.3, and 62.8 o are contributed to γ-Fe2O3, and  33.08, 40.78 and 49.42 o are related to α-Fe2O3. The broad peaks at about 19.9 and  24.1 o are characteristic peaks of PANI [27]. These results indicate that the', '2', 'PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions contain two different phases of the Fe2O3  particles, and the PANI is amorphous in the composite.', 'Fig. 2. XRD pattern of the PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions.   UV-vis spectra', 'Fig. 3. UV-vis spectra of PANI (a) and PANI/Fe2O3 composite (b) dispersions.    The UV-vis absorption spectra of PANI and the PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions  are shown in Fig. 3. A typical absorption spectrum of PANI dispersions has three', '3', 'distinct absorption peaks at 351, 436, and 757 nm, respectively (Fig. 3a). The peak  at 351 nm arises from π-π* electron transition within benzenoid segments, the peak  at 436 nm is due to the polaron state and the wide peak at 757 nm is related to the  doping level [28]. Compared to the PANI dispersions, the absorption peak of  PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions show little difference, for example, the peak at  757 nm shifts to 746 nm (Fig. 3b). The shift may be originated from the decreasing  doping level by the addition of Fe2O3.  FT-IR spectra', 'The FT-IR spectra of PANI and PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions are shown in Fig.  4. From Fig. 4a, we can find the characteristic peaks of PANI: the peak at 684 cm-1 is  usually assigned to the C-H out of plane bending in 1, 2 ring in intrinsic PANI; the  peak at 1083 cm-1 stands for the C-H aromatic in-plane bending on 1, 4 ring; the  peak at 1183 cm-1 may be assigned to the carbon skeleton, and the peak of 1311 cm-', '1 is contributed to C-N stretching mode. The strong peak at 1459 cm-1 is related to  C=C stretching mode of the benzenoid ring and a weak peak of quionoid ring at 1548  cm-1 means the high doping degree of the PANI [29]. And from Fig. 4b, we can see  that when the Fe2O3 particles present in the dispersion, the intensity of the peak at  1459 cm-1 is decreased and shift to 1461 cm-1, which represents the decrease of  doping degree of the PANI. There may be some interaction between the lone pair  electrons of N atom in PANI chains with 3d orbit of Fe atom, which could reduce the  energy level interval of aromatic nucleus. This also caused the UV-vis absorption  band of composite dispersions to have a red shift [30].', 'Fig. 4. FT-IR spectra of PANI (a) and PANI/Fe2O3 composite (b) dispersions.   Conductivity', 'Table 1 shows the conductivity values measured by using four-probe technology at  25 0C. Compared to pure PANI, the conductivity of PANI/Fe2O3 composite with Fe2O3  content of 0.05 g increases from 0.98 to 1.07μS/cm. This may be attributed to the  doping effect associated with Fe2O3 particles that are believed to help induce the  formation of a more efficient network for change transport, thus enhancing the', '4', 'conductivity of the composite [31]. However, with increasing the content of Fe2O3, the  relative contents of the conducting polymer are decreased, resulting in the decrease  of the corresponding conductivity. The decrease may be attributed to two factors: (a)  the insulating behavior of the Fe2O3 particles in the core of the composites; (b) a  decrease of doping degree as the UV-vis and FT-IR spectra show [32].

It can be applied to the detection of  ammonia, and the further study of the sensitivity to NH3 and other gases is under  way.', '5', 'Stability', 'The stability of the dispersions with different content of Fe2O3 particles was studied.  When the content of Fe2O3 particles in the dispersions was lower than 0.05 g, the  dispersions show good stability and existed without precipitate at least half a year.  However, when the content was beyond 0.05 g, there were some precipitates on the  bottom of the dispersion and the quantity of the precipitates increased with the  content of Fe2O3.   Conclusions', 'PANI/Fe2O3 dispersions were prepared using DBSA both as dopant and surfactant.  The XRD, UV-vis and FT-IR characterization indicated that there is some interaction  between the PANI and Fe2O3. The conductivity of the dispersions increased when a  little of Fe2O3 particles were added and decreased in line when a great quantity of  Fe2O3 were added. The dispersions showed good stability and existed without  precipitate for at least half a year. A film were prepared by directly spinning the  PANI/Fe2O3 dispersions on a chip of silicon to study the gas-sensing of100ppm NH3;  the response time is only 40 s and further study of the sensitivity to the NH3 is under  way.    Experimental  Materials', 'Aniline was freshly distilled under reduced pressure and other chemicals were used  as received without further purification. Fe2O3 particles were synthesized by  coprecipitation.    Preparation of PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersion', 'PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions were prepared using an in-situ polymerization  method. A typical experiment was done as follows: 0.465 g of aniline was dispersed  into 100 ml of DBSA aqueous solution (0.2 M) under stirring, after which 0.1 g of  Fe2O3 was added into the above solution under ultrasonic. APS in powder state was  then added into the mixture solution. The dispersions of PANI/Fe2O3 composite were  obtained after stirring for 1 h. The PANI dispersions were prepared by the same  approach in absence of Fe2O3. Acetone damaging dispersions were centrifuged and  washed with distilled water, ethanol and acetone three times, respectively. The  resulting powder were dried under reduced pressure at room temperature and then  used for XRD and conductivity measurements.   Characterization', 'The composite dispersions was spun onto a chip of silicon and dried under 60 oC in  order to remove the solvent and form a film for the UV-vis and FT-IR spectra  measurement and study NH3 gas-sensing behavior. UV-vis and FT-IR spectra were  recorded on a UV 3100 spectrometer and on FT-IR-8400s (Shimadzu) spectrometer,  respectively. The conductivity measurements were made by the conventional four-probe (SDY-5) method on pressed pellets of the composite powders prepared at  ambient temperature (25 oC). The gas-sensing behavior, which could be reflected by  the resistance change of the resulting PANI/Fe2O3 composite film upon exposure to  100 ppm of NH3, was monitored with a digital multimeter (DT9205).', '6', 'References', '[1] Su S.J.; Kuramoto N.

The most popular class of GNNs operate by exchanging informationbetween adjacent nodes, and are known as Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs).While understanding the expressive power of MPNNs is a key question, existing resultstypically consider settings with uninformative node features. In this paper, we provide arigorous analysis to determine which function classes of node features can be learned by anMPNN of a given capacity. We do so by measuring the level of pairwise interactions betweennodes that MPNNs allow for. This measure provides a novel quantitative characterizationof the so-called over-squashing effect, which is observed to occur when a large volume ofmessages is aggregated into fixed-size vectors. Using our measure, we prove that, to guaranteesufficient communication between pairs of nodes, the capacity of the MPNN must be largeenough, depending on properties of the input graph structure, such as commute times. Formany relevant scenarios, our analysis results in impossibility statements in practice, showingthat over-squashing hinders the expressive power of MPNNs. Our theory also holds forgeometric graphs and hence extends to equivariant MPNNs on point clouds. We validateour analysis through extensive controlled experiments and ablation studies.', '1Introduction', 'Graphs describe the relational structure for a large variety of natural and artificial systems, making learningon graphs imperative in many contexts (Veličković, 2023; DeZoort et al., 2023; Williamson, 2023). To thisend, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (Gori et al., 2005; Scarselli et al., 2008) have emerged as a widelypopular framework for graph machine learning, with plentiful success stories in science (Bapst et al., 2020;', '∗Equal contribution.', '1', 'Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (02/2024)', 'u', 'v', 'wq. . .z', 'Figure 1: We study the power of MPNNs in terms of the mixing they induce among features and show thatthis is affected by the model (via norm of the weights and depth) and the graph topology (via commutetimes). For the given graph, the MPNN learns stronger mixing (tight springs) for nodes v, u and u, w sincetheir commute time is small, while nodes u, q and u, z, with high commute-time, have weak mixing (loosesprings). We characterize over-squashing as the inverse of the mixing induced by an MPNN and hence relateit to its power. In fact, the MPNN might require an impractical depth to solve tasks on the given graph thatdepend on high-mixing of features assigned to u, z.', 'Davies et al., 2021; Blundell et al., 2021; Stokes et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2023) and technology (Monti et al.,2019; Mirhoseini et al., 2021; Derrow-Pinion et al., 2021).', 'Given an underlying graph and features, defined on its nodes (and edges), as inputs, a GNN learns parametricfunctions from data. Due to the ubiquity of GNNs, characterizing their expressive power, i.e., whichclass of functions a GNN is able to learn, is a problem of great interest. In this context, most availableresults in literature on the universality of GNNs pertain to impractical higher-order tensors (Maron et al.,2019; Keriven & Peyré, 2019) or unique node identifiers that may break the symmetries of the problem(Loukas, 2020). In particular, these results do not necessarily apply to Message Passing Neural Networks(MPNNs) (Gilmer et al., 2017), which have emerged as the most popular class of GNN models in recent years.Concerning expressivity results for MPNNs, the most general available characterization is due to Xu et al.', '(2019) and Morris et al. (2019), who proved that MPNNs are, at most, as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lemangraph isomorphism test (Weisfeiler & Leman, 1968) in distinguishing graphs without any features. This bringsus to an important question:', 'Which classes of functions can MPNNs of a given capacity learn, if node features are specified?', 'Razin et al. (2022) address this question by characterizing the separation rank of MPNNs; however, theiranalysis only covers unconventional architectures that do not correspond to MPNN models used in practice.In contrast, Alon & Yahav (2021) investigate this question empirically, by observing that MPNNs fail tosolve tasks which involve long-range interactions among nodes. This limitation was ascribed to a phenomenontermed as over-squashing, which loosely entails messages being ‘squashed’ into fixed-size vectors when thereceptive field of a node grows too fast. This effect was formalized in Topping et al. (2022); Di Giovanni et al.', '(2023); Black et al. (2023), who showed that the Jacobian of the nodes features is affected by topologicalproperties of the graph, such as curvature and effective resistance. However, all the aforementioned papersignore the specifics of the task at hand, i.e., the underlying function that the MPNN seeks to learn, leadingus to the following question:', 'How does over-squashing affect the expressive power of MPNNs? Can we measure it?', 'What about geometric graphs? In many scientific applications, data come as graphs embedded inEuclidean space. Since popular architectures resort to the message-passing paradigm (Gasteiger et al., 2021;Dauparas et al., 2022; Batzner et al., 2022), the expressive power of such models has been rephrased inthe language of the WL test, once extended to account for the extra geometric information (Joshi et al.,2023). Nonetheless, the questions raised above are even more pressing for these tasks, where the graph istypically derived from a point cloud using a cutoff radius, while the features also contain information aboutthe positions in 3D space. In fact, for such problems where the features may carry more valuable information', '2', 'Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (02/2024)', 'than the 2D graph structure, we argue that proposing new ways to assess the power of message-passingother than (variants of) the WL test, is crucial. To this aim, in our paper we study generic message-passingequations with no assumptions on the nature of the features, meaning that they may also include additionalpositional information if the dataset is a point cloud embedded in Euclidean space.', 'Contributions. Our main goal is to show how over-squashing can be understood as the misalignmentbetween the task and the graph-topology, thereby limiting the classes of functions that MPNNs of practicalsize can learn (see Figure 1). We start by measuring the extent to which an MPNN allows any pair of nodesin the graph to interact (via mixing their features). With this measure as a tool, we characterize whichfunctions of node features can be learned by an MPNN and how the model architecture and parameters, aswell as the topology of the graph, affect the expressive power. More concretely,', '• We introduce a novel metric of expressive power that is based on the Hessian of the function learnedby an MPNN and measures the ability of a model to mix features associated with different nodes.This approach complements the current repertoire of tools at disposal to assess the power of GNNs,and is of interest independent of the over-squashing phenomenon.', '• We then prove upper bounds on the Hessian of functions learned by MPNNs, hence deriving limitationson the power of MPNNs to mix features (i.e., model interactions) according to the novel metricmentioned above. As far as we know, this is the first theoretical result stating limitations of MPNNsto learn functions and their derivatives.', '• We characterize over-squashing as the reciprocal of the maximal mixing that MPNNs can induce amongnodes: the higher this measure, the smaller the class of functions MPNNs can learn. Differently fromthe WL-test, which depends on the separation of node representations based on the computationaltrees, our metric quantifies the ability of an MPNN to mix information associated with differentnodes and the cost required to do so in terms of size of the weights and depth.', '• We prove that the weights and depth must be sufficiently large – depending on the topology – toensure mixing. For some tasks, the depth must exceed the highest commute time on the graph, resultingin impossibility statements. Our results show that MPNNs of practical size, fail to learn functionswith strong mixing among nodes at high commute time.', '• We illustrate our theoretical results with controlled experiments that verify our analysis, by highlight-ing the impact of the architecture (depth), of the topology (commute time), and of the underlyingtask (the level of mixing required).', 'Thus, we present a novel paradigm for deriving rigorous results in relating two key notions in graph machinelearning, that of GNN expressive power and over-squashing.', '2The Message-Passing paradigm', 'Definitions on graphs. We denote a graph by G = (V, E), where V is the set of n nodes while E are theedges. We assume that G is undirected, connected and non-bipartite and define the n × n adjacency matrix Aas Avu = 1 if (v, u) ∈E and zero otherwise. We let D be the diagonal degree matrix with Dvv := dv and use dmax and dmin to denote the maximal and minimal degrees. Since we are interested in the over-squashingphenomenon, which affects the propagation of information, we need to quantify distances on G. We let dG(v, u)be the length of the shortest path connecting nodes v and u (geodesic distance). While dG describes howfar two nodes u, v are in G, it does not account for how many different routes they can use to communicate.In fact, we will see below that the over-squashing of nodes v, u and, more generally, the mixing induced byMPNNs among the features associated with v, u, can be better quantified by their commute time τ(v, u),equal to the expected number of steps for a random walk to start at v, reach u, and then come back to v.', 'The MPNN-class. For most problems, graphs are equipped with features {xv}v∈V ⊂Rd, whose matrixrepresentation is X ∈Rn×d. To study the interactions induced by a GNN among pairs of features, we focuson graph-level tasks – in Section E of the Appendix, we extend the discussion and our main theoretical results', '3', 'Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (02/2024)', 'to node-level tasks. The goal then is to predict a function X �→yG(X), where we assume that the graph Gis fixed and thus yG : Rn×d →R is a function of the node features. MPNNs define a family of parametricfunctions through iterative local updates of the node features: the feature of node v at layer t is derived as', 'h(t)v= f (t) �h(t−1)v, g(t) �{{h(t−1)u, (v, u) ∈E}}��,h(0)v= xv(1)', 'where f (t), g(t) are learnable functions, g(t) is invariant to permutations and {{·}} denotes a multiset –meaning terms can be repeated.

The layer-update in (2) includes common MPNN-models such as GCN (Kipf& Welling, 2017), SAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017), GIN (Xu et al., 2019), and GatedGCN (Bresson & Laurent,2017). As commented extensively in Section 6, this is the most general class of MPNN equations studiedthus far in theoretical works on over-squashing; unless otherwise stated, all our considerations and analysisapply to MPNNs as in (2). For graph-level tasks, a permutation-invariant readout READ is required – usuallyMAX, MEAN, or SUM. We define the graph-level function computed by the MPNN after m layers to be', 'y(m)G(X) = θ⊤READ({{h(m)v}}),(3)', 'for some learnable θ ∈Rd. While a more complex non-linear readout can be considered, we restrict to asingle linear-layer since we are interested in the mixing among variables induced by the MPNN itself throughthe topology (and not in readout, independently of the graph-structure).', 'MPNNs on geometric graphs.We note that (2) also describes a class of generic, equivariant MPNNsover a point cloud embedded in Euclidean space, once the matrix A is intended to encode the pairs ofpoints that exchange information across each layer—typically creating a graph G by drawing a weighted edgebetween any pair of points whose distance is smaller than a cutoff radius. In fact, throughout our analysiswe have no restriction on the type of features hv, that can also contain the position of a node in 3D space.Accordingly, our theoretical results below hold for MPNNs on both 2D and 3D data, since they pertain to howthe message passing paradigm models pairwise interactions among different points (nodes). To streamline thepresentation, we often omit to specify that the features can also encode 3D information (when available).', '3On the mixing induced by Message Passing Neural Networks', 'As one of the main contributions of this paper, we propose a new framework for characterizing the expressivepower of MPNNs by estimating the amount of mixing they induce among pairs of features xv and xu,corresponding to the nodes v and u ∈V. To motivate our definition, fix the underlying graph G, let yG be theground-truth function to be learned, and suppose, for simplicity, that the node features {xi} are all scalar.If yG is a smooth function, then we can take the Taylor expansion of yG at any point ¯x = (¯x1, . . . , ¯xn) andobtain a polynomial in the variables (x1, . . . , xn), up to higher-order corrections. The mixing induced by yGon the features xv, xu can then be expressed in terms of mixed product monomials of the form xvxu, andthe powers thereof. The lowest-degree mixed monomials of this form are multiplied by the Hessian (i.e. thesecond-order derivatives) of yG. Accordingly, we can take the entries v, u of the Hessian of yG as the simplestmeasure of pairwise mixing induced by yG over the nodes v, u. In fact, to make things more concrete,note that if yG(x) = ϕ0(xv) + ϕ1(xu), then the mixing (Hessian) would always be zero since the variables arefully separable; conversely, if yG(x) = ϕ(x⊤v xu), then the amplitude of the mixing (Hessian) depends on hownonlinear ϕ is. The same reasoning applies to higher-dimensional node features too:', 'Definition 3.1. For a twice differentiable graph-function yG of node features {xi}, the maximal mixinginduced by yG among the features xv and xu associated with nodes v, u is', 'mixyG(v, u) = maxximax1≤α,β≤d', '�����∂2yG(X)', '∂xαv ∂xβu', '�����.(4)', '4', 'Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (02/2024)', 'We note that the first maximum is taken over all input features – considering that the Hessian of yG is itselfa function of the node features over the graph – while the second maximum is taken over all entries α, β ofthe d-dimensional node features xv and xu; it is straightforward to adapt the results below to alternativedefinitions based on different norms of the Hessian.', 'Problem statement. Our goal is to study the expressive power of MPNNs in terms of the (maximal) mixingthey can generate among nodes v, u. A low value of mixing implies that the MPNN cannot learn functions yG that require high mixing of the features associated with v, u and hence they cannot model ‘product’-typeinteractions as per our explanation based on the Taylor expansion. We investigate how weights and depth onthe one side, and the graph topology on the other, affect the mixing of an MPNN.', 'The requirement of smoothness. In many applications, especially when deploying neural network modelsto solve partial differential equations, the predictions need to be sufficiently regular (smooth), which motivatesthe adoption of smooth non-linear activations (Hornik et al., 1990; Brandstetter et al., 2021; Equer et al.,2023). Our analysis below follows this paradigm and holds for all activations σ that are (at least) twicedifferentiable, including smoother versions of ReLU such as the GELU function.', '3.1Pairwise mixing induced by MPNNs', 'In this Section, our goal is to derive an upper bound on the maximal mixing induced by MPNNs, as definedabove, over the features associated with pairs of nodes v, u. To motivate the structure of this bound, weconsider the simple yet illustrative setting of an MPNN as in (2) with scalar features, weights ω, w > 0 and alinear message function of the form ψ(x, y) = c1x + c2y, for some learnable constants c1, c2.

Hence, the operator wS governs the flow of information from layer t −1to layer t – once we factor out the derivatives of σ – and the k-power of this matrix (wS)k determines thepropagation of information on the graph over k layers, i.e. over walks of length k.', 'Suppose that nodes v, u are at distance r on the graph. If this MPNN has depth m, to have any mixing amongthe features of v and u, there has to be a node i that receives information from both v and u, which onlyoccurs when m ≥r/2. If m = r/2, then we can roughly estimate the mixing at node i as ((wS)m)iv((wS)m)iu.When m > r/2, information from v and u can arrive at i after being processed at an intermediate node j; infact, this node j first collects information from both v and u over a walk of length m −k, and then shares itwith node i over a walk of length k.

For models with linear ψ, such as GCN, SAGE or GIN, these constants will suffice in deriving theupper bound on the mixing.

Therefore, ourgoal now is to expand (7) and relate it to known quantities on the graph and show how this can be used tocharacterize the phenomenon of over-squashing. First, we introduce a notion of capacity of an MPNN in thespirit of Loukas (2020).', 'The capacity of an MPNN.

In applications to physics and PDEs, we may often need theneural-network to also match derivatives of a target function (Hornik et al., 1990).

We refer to this quantity as mixing,since it relates to mixed product monomials of the Taylor polynomial expansion. Since mixing is a propertyof the task, assessing the mixing ability of an MPNN becomes an additional metric of expressive power.Graph functions whose mixing violates (7), cannot be learned by MPNNs satisfying Theorem 3.2.', '4Over-squashing limits the expressive power of MPNNs', 'Over-squashing was originally described in Alon & Yahav (2021) as the failure of MPNNs to propagateinformation across distant nodes. In fact, Topping et al. (2022); Black et al. (2023); Di Giovanni et al. (2023)showed that over-squashing – quantified by the sensitivity of node v to the input feature at node u viatheir Jacobian – is affected by topological properties such as curvature and effective resistance; however,no connection to how over-squashing affects the expressive power of MPNNs, nor proposal of measures forover-squashing have been derived. In light of these works, it is evident that over-squashing is related to theinability of MPNNs to model interactions among certain nodes, depending on the underlying graph topology.Since one can rely on the Taylor expansion of a graph function to measure such interactions through thesecond-order derivatives, i.e. the maximal mixing, we leverage Definition 3.1 to propose a novel, broader,but more accurate, characterization of over-squashing:', 'Definition 4.1.

If suchmaximal mixing is large, then there is no obstruction to exchanging information between the given nodes andhence the over-squashing measure would be small; conversely, the over-squashing is large precisely when themodel struggles to mix features associated with nodes v and u.', 'In general though, computing the actual mixing induced by an MPNN may be difficult.

In contrast to existing analysis on thelimitations of MPNNs via graph-isomorphism test, our results characterize the expressivity of MPNNs evenwhen meaningful (geometric) features are provided. Corollary 4.5 implies that for any given maximalnumber of layers m and for any graph G with commute time τ, we can identify classes of functions that areoutside the hypothesis space of the MPNNs: these are the ones whose mixing violates (9).', 'Since the commute time of two adjacent nodes v, u equals 2|E| if (v, u) is a cut-edge (Aleliunas et al.,1979), our result shows that MPNNs may require m = Ω(|E|) to generate enough mixing along a cut-edge,drawing a connection with Zhang et al.

Our analysis shows, precisely, how over-squashing can be understoodas a fundamental problem associated with how hard – as measured by the number of layers required – is foran MPNN to exchange information between nodes that are ‘badly connected’, as per their commute timemetric distance, whatever this information might be.', 'Message of the Section: If the mixing generated by an MPNN is small, then the model struggles toexchange information between nodes. Accordingly, we propose to measure over-squashing as the inverse ofthe mixing induced by an MPNN. Next, we asked: given a target level of mixing, what is the capacity ofthe MPNN required to match such quantity? We have addressed this question for the cases of boundeddepth (Theorem 4.3) and bounded weights (Theorem 4.4). In the latter, we have shown that the minimalnumber of layers required by an MPNN to match a given level of mixing, grows with the commute timedistance. Therefore, our analysis explicitly identifies classes of functions that are impossible to be learnedon certain graphs for MPNNs of bounded depth.', '5Experimental validation of the theoretical results', 'Next, we aim to empirically verify the theoretical findings of this paper, i.e., the characterization of theimpact of the graph topology (via commute time τ), the GNN architecture (depth, norm of weights), and theunderlying task (node mixing) on over-squashing. This, however, requires detailed information about theunderlying function to be learned, which is not readily available in practice. Hence, we perform our empiricaltest in a controlled environment, but at the same time, we base our experiments on the real world ZINCchemical dataset (Irwin et al., 2012) and follow the experimental setup in Dwivedi et al. (2020), constrainingthe number of molecular graphs to 12K. Moreover, we exclude the edge features from this experiment and fixthe MPNN size to ∼100K parameters. However, instead of regressing the constrained solubility based on themolecular input graphs, we define our own synthetic node features as well as our own target values as follows.', 'Let {Gi} be the set of the 12K ZINC molecular graphs. We set all node features to zero, except for two, whichare set to uniform random numbers xiui, xivi between 0 and 1 (i.e., xiui, xivi ∼U(0, 1)) for all i. The targetoutput is set to yi = tanh(xiui + xivi) for all i. Hence, the task entails a non-linear mixing with non-vanishingsecond derivatives. The two non-zero node features xiui, xivi are positioned on Gi according to the commutetime τ, i.e., for a given α ∈[0, 1], we choose the nodes ui, vi as the α-quantile of the τ-distribution overGi. This enables us to have the desired control on the level of commute time of the underlying mixing (i.e., α1 < α2, if α1 results in a lower τ than α2). See Fig. 2 for an illustration of a ZINC graph together withthe histogram of the corresponding τ between all pairs of different nodes. We call this graph dataset thesynthetic ZINC dataset.', 'We consider four different MPNN models namely GCN (Kipf & Welling, 2017), GIN (Xu et al., 2019),GraphSAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017), and GatedGCN (Bresson & Laurent, 2017).

To this end, we fix the architecture for all considered MPNNs. In particular, weset the depth to m = maxi⌈diam(Gi)/2⌉, which happens to be m = 11 for the considered ZINC 12K graphs,such that the MPNNs are guaranteed not to underreach. We further vary the value of the α-quantile of the τ-distributions over the graphs Gi between 0 and 1, thus controlling the level of commute times. Accordingto our theoretical findings in Section 4, the measure �OSQv,u (Definition 4.2) heavily depends on the commutetime τ of the underlying mixing as derived in Theorem 4.4. In fact, this can be empirically verified inAppendix Fig. 7, where �OSQv,u increases for increasing values of α. Thus, we would expect the MPNNs toperform significantly worse for increasing levels of the commute time. This is indeed confirmed in Fig. 3depicting the resulting test mean absolute error (MAE) (average and standard deviation over several randomweight initializations), and showing that the test MAE increases for larger values of α for all consideredMPNNs. The same qualitative behavior can be observed for the training MAE (Appendix F.2).

To this end, we considera high commute time-regime by setting α = 0.8. Note that in this case the maximum (over all graphs Gi)shortest path between two nodes ui, vi is 14. Therefore, a depth of m = 7 is sufficient to avoid under-reachingon all graphs. However, according to the over-squashing measure we provide and the conclusions of Theorem4.4, we expect the MPNNs to be able to induce more mixing among nodes v, u, and hence reduce the error,as we increase the number of layers. This expectation is further evidenced in Appendix Fig. 8, where thecomputed �OSQ decreases for increasing number of layers. In Fig. 4, we plot the test MAE (average andstandard deviation over several random weight initializations) of all considered MPNNs for increasing numberof layers. We can indeed see that all considered GNNs benefit from depth, and thus higher capacity (Definition3.3), as GatedGCN obtains the lowest test MAE with 16 layers, as well as GraphSAGE, GIN, and GCNwith 32 layers. The same qualitative behavior can be observed for the training MAE (Appendix F.2). Ourtheoretical results provide a strong explanation as to why a task only depending on the mixing of nodeswithin 14 hops – so that 7 layers would suffice – actually benefits from many more layers. Naturally, wecannot increase the depth arbitrarily, as at some point other issues emerge, such as vanishing gradients, whichimpact the trainability of the MPNNs (Rusch et al., 2022). Moreover, as can be additionally seen in Fig. 4,all models exhibit low standard deviation (over several trained MPNNs). We finally point out that, whileover-squashing occurs – as can be seen when the number of layers ‘only’ equals the minimal one to avoidunderreaching – it can be mitigated by taking much deeper architectures.', '5.3The role of mixing', 'We further test the considered MPNN architectures on their performance with respect to different mixings.To this end, we consider again the tanh-based mixing as in our previous tasks (i.e., regressing targets yi = tanh(xiui + xivi) for each graph Gi in the dataset), as well as another mixing based on the exponentialfunction (i.e., with targets yi = exp(xiui + xivi)). We note that these two tasks differ significantly in terms oftheir maximal mixing values (4) (shown in Table 1). Thus, according to (8) and Theorem 4.4, we would expectthat MPNNs perform significantly worse in the case of higher maximal mixing, i.e., for the exponential-basedmixing compared to the tanh-mixing. To confirm this empirically, we train the MPNNs on both typesof mixing and provide the resulting relative MAEs (i.e., MAE divided by the L1-norm of the targets) inTable 1. We can see that all four MPNNs perform significantly better on the tanh-mixing than on theexponential-based mixing. Moreover, increasing the range for the exponential-based mixing from 1 to 1.5further impairs the performance of all considered MPNNs. In order to check if this difference in performancecan simply be explained by a higher capacity required by a neural network to accurately approximate themapping exp(x+y) compared to tanh(x+y) for some inputs x, y ∈R, we train a simple two-layer feed-forwardneural network (with 2 inputs, i.e., x and y) on both mappings. The trained networks reach a similarly lowrelative MAE of 4.6 × 10−4 for the tanh(x + y) mapping as well as 4.1 × 10−4 for the exp(x + y) mappingusing an input range of (0, 1) and 4.0 × 10−4 for an input range of (0, 1.5). Thus, we can conclude that thesignificant differences in the obtained results in Table 1 are not caused by a higher capacity required by aneural network to learn the underlying mappings of the different mixings.', 'Table 1: Relative MAE of GCN, GIN, GraphSAGE and GatedGCN on different choices of mixing on syntheticZINC for a fixed 0.8-quantile of the commute time distributions over graphs Gi.', 'Mixinginput intervalmaximal mixingGCNGINGraphSAGEGatedGCN', 'tanh(xiui + xivi)(0, 1)≈0.770.0240.0140.0060.004exp(xiui + xivi)(0, 1)≈7.40.0430.0210.0330.008exp(xiui + xivi)(0, 1.5)≈20.10.0540.0350.0750.014', '11', 'Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (02/2024)', '6Discussion', 'Related Work: expressive power of MPNNs. The MPNN class in (2) is as powerful as the 1-WL test(Weisfeiler & Leman, 1968) in distinguishing unattributed graphs (Xu et al., 2019; Morris et al., 2019). Infact, MPNNs typically struggle to compute graph properties on feature-less graphs (Dehmamy et al., 2019;Chen et al., 2020; Sato et al., 2019; Loukas, 2020). The expressivity of GNNs has also been studied fromthe point of view of logical and tensor languages (Barceló et al., 2019; Azizian & Lelarge, 2021; Geerts &Reutter, 2022). Nonetheless, far less is known about which functions of node features MPNNs can learn andthe capacity required to do so. Razin et al. (2022) recently studied the separation rank of a specific MPNNclass. While this approach is a strong inspiration for our work, the results in Razin et al. (2022) only applyto a single unconventional family of MPNNs which does not include MPNN models used in practice. Ourresults instead hold in the full generality of (2) and provide a novel approach for investigating the expressivityof MPNNs through the mixing they are able to generate among features.', 'Mixing and the WL test. We emphasize that throughout our analysis we had no assumption on thenature of the features, that can in fact be structural or positional – meaning that the MPNNs we haveconsidered above, may also be more powerful than the 1-WL test. Our derivations do not rely on the abilityto distinguish different node representations, but rather on the ability of the MPNN to mix informationassociated with different nodes. This novel alternative paradigm may help design GNNs that are morepowerful at mixing than MPNNs, and may further shed light on how and when frameworks such as GraphTransformers can solve the underlying task better than conventional MPNNs. Similarly, our analysis holds forall equivariant MPNNs of the form (2) acting on geometric graphs embedded in Euclidean space, independentof the geometric information included in the features.', 'Differences between our results and existing works on over-squashing. The problem of over-squashing was introduced in Alon & Yahav (2021) and studied through sensitivity analysis in Topping et al.', '(2022). This approach was generalized in Black et al. (2023); Di Giovanni et al. (2023) who proved that theJacobian of node features is likely to be small if the nodes have high commute time (effective resistance). Wediscuss more in detail the novelty of this work when compared to Topping et al. (2022); Di Giovanni et al.', '(2023). (i) In Topping et al. (2022); Di Giovanni et al. (2023) there is no analysis on which functions MPNNscannot learn as a consequence of over-squashing, nor a formal measure of over-squashing is provided. In fact,they only derive some conditions under which the Jacobian of node features can be small, but do not connectit to the ability of MPNNs to learn desired function classes. Besides, the Jacobian of node features may notbe suited for studying over-squashing for graph-level tasks. Note that our theory holds for node-level tasksand generalize existing approaches (see Appendix E). (ii) The analysis in Topping et al. (2022) does not studyover-squashing among nodes at distance larger than 2 and does not provide insights on the capacity requiredto learn certain tasks. (iii) Finally, the analysis in Di Giovanni et al. (2023) does not account for MPNNssuch as GatedGCN, and is only carried out in a simplified setting where the activation function is chosen tobe a ReLU and its derivatives are taken to be the same, in expectation, for every path in the computationalgraph. We have extended these ideas to connect over-squashing and expressive power by studying higher-orderderivatives of the MPNN and relating them to the capacity of the model and the underlying graph-topology.', '6.1Limitations and ways forward', 'The measures OSQ and �OSQ. Definition 4.1 considers pairs of nodes and second-order derivatives; thiscould be generalized to build a hierarchy of measures with increasingly higher-order interactions of nodes.The proxy (lower bound) �OSQ in Definition 4.2 allows to derive necessary conditions for the MPNN to learnclasses of functions based on their mixing. If, depending on the problem, one has access to better estimates onthe mixing induced by an MPNN than (7), then one can extend our approach and get a finer approximationof OSQ. In the paper we focused our analysis on the case of graph-level tasks; we provide an extension tonode-level functions in Section E.', 'Beyond sum-aggregations.

Extending the analysis to these models is only more technically involved. More generally, onecould replace the aggregation �u Avu in (2) with a smooth, permutation invariant operator �(Bronsteinet al., 2021; Ong & Veličković, 2022). Our formalism will then prove useful to assess if different aggregationsare more expressive in terms of the mixing (interactions) they are able to generate.', 'Graph rewiring. Another way of going beyond (2) to find MPNNs with lower OSQ is to replace A with adifferent matrix A′, (partly) independent of the connectivity of the input graph. In other words, one couldrewire the graph, by replacing G with G′. Indeed, Theorem 4.4 further validates why recent graph-rewiringmethods such as (Arnaiz-Rodríguez et al., 2022; Karhadkar et al., 2023; Deac et al., 2022; Black et al., 2023)manage to alleviate over-squashing: by adding edges that decrease the overall effective resistance (commutetime) of the graph, these methods reduce the measure OSQ. More generally, Definition 4.2 allows one tomeasure whether a given rewiring is beneficial in terms of over-squashing (and hence of the mixing generated)and to what extent. In fact, it follows from Theorem 4.4 that methods like (Deac et al., 2022; Shirzad et al.,', '2023) are optimal from the point of view of friendliness of the computational graph to message-passing,since they both propose to propagate information over expander graphs, which are sparse and have commutetime scaling linearly with the number of edges. Finally, our theoretical results suggest that for data givenby point clouds in 3D space, the choice of a computational graph over which message passing can operate,should also account for the its commute time, given that the latter is closely aligned with over-squashing.', 'Acknowledgements.

A simple Random Walk (RW) on G is a Markovchain supported on the nodes V with transition matrix defined by P(v, u) = d−1v . While a RW can bestudied through different properties, the one we are interested in is the commute time τ, which represents theexpected number of steps for a RW starting at v, to visit u and then come back to v. The commute time isa distance on the graph and captures the diffusion properties associated with the underlying topology. Infact, while nodes that are distant often have larger commute time, the latter is more expressive than theshortest-walk graph-distance, since it also accounts (for example) for the number of paths connecting twogiven nodes.

In our theoretical development in Section 4 we have decidedto rely on the absolute measurement since our analysis depends on the derivation of the maximal mixinginduced by an MPNN (i.e. upper bounds) which translate into necessary criteria for an MPNN to generatea given level of mixing. In principle, to deal with relative measurements, one would also need some formof lower bound on the maximal mixing and hence address also whether the conditions provided are indeedsufficient.

In particular, in light of Theorem C.1, we can extend themeasure of over-squashing to the case of first-order interactions for node-level tasks.

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25�C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 �C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 �10�4 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 �0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 �C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 �C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by significant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of �4 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers. �2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through proton', 'exchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Nafion�as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18]. Transport properties and nanostructure of sulfonated polyimide (SPI) membranes have been studied using pulsed field gradient NMR and NMR quadrupolar relaxation rates determinations [19,20], and small angle scattering methods (SAXS and SANS), respectively [21,22].', '* Corresponding author.

We recently reported a class of ionomers based on aromatic hydrocarbon copolymers with high proton conductivity and excellent thermal mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states [22e29]. Sulfonated poly-arylenethioethersulfone(SPTES)copolymershavefollowing chemical structures (Fig. 1). SPTES copolymers including SPTES-50, SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80, have equivalent weight (EW) and IEC (mequiv./g) values of 610, 515, 459, 417, and 1.64, 1.94, 2.18, and 2.4, respectively [22]. They exhibited proton conductivity of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm respectively, at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity [22]. Their excellent proton conductivity at high temperatures combined with their high glass transition temperature (w200 �C) and mechanical stability (both in the dry and hydrated states) make them excellent potentials as high temperature PEM materials for fuel cells. SPTES-50 copolymer membrane has successfully been fabricated to membrane electrode assemblies and exhibited polarization curves and durability up to 400 h [29]. Their successful operations at 90e100 �C were limited by boiling point of water (100 �C at 1 atm). Replacing water molecules with heterocycles such as imidazolium where the charge carrier has a very low vapor pressure can result in proton conductivity at higher temperatures. Despite excellent electrochemical properties, excessive water uptake of SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes provide difficulties to be made as membrane electrode assembly [22,27] The proton transport and performance of SPTES copolymers highly depend on the presence of water molecules. In addition to the number of sulfonic groups, their acidity (pKa) ability to dissociate water molecules to proton, water activity coefficient, and number of water molecules associated with each sulfonic group, the supermolecular structure of the hydro-phobic and hydrophilic phases is also defined by polymer chain characteristics such as chain persistent length, and presence of sulfonic group on the backbone or in the side chains. We reported the presence of ionic nanodomains containing water molecules in the SPTES-70 using in-situ x-ray scattering [27]. The morphology and the nanostructure of SPTES-50 were approximated by corre-lated polydisperse spherical aggregates and a larger scale water domain network and were quantified by modeling of the SANS spectra with polydisperse hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [29]. This study reports the nanostructure and morphology of sulfonated polyarylenethioethersulfone (SPTES) copolymer membranes which is directly related to the proton transport through the membrane in terms of their degree of sulfonation and temperature dependency.', '2. Materials and methods', '2.1. Materials', 'Visually observed defect free films of SPTES copolymers were prepared by dissolving the purified copolymer in dimethyl acet-amide (DMAc, Sigma Aldrich) (5e10 wt%) filtering, placing in a flat dish in a vacuum oven with a gradual temperature rise to 100 �C for 24 h and 120 �C for 2 h. The resulting uniform flat films were immersed for 2 h in deionized water and dried under vacuum (24 h, 80 �C) after they were acidified in sulfuric acid (4 M, 24 h) to ensure complete conversion of sulfonic groups to their protonated forms.', '2.2. Characterization', 'SANS experiments were performed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Neutron Center for Research using 30 m NG-7 SANS instrument with a neutron wavelength, l, of 6 Å (Dl/l ¼ 10%) and three sample-to-detector distance of 1.5 m, 10 m (l ¼ 6 Å), and 15 m (l ¼ 8 Å), 0.001 < q < 0.3168 Å�1 at 25, and 55 �C (accuracy of 0.5 �C). Hydrated membranes were placed in demountable 1 mm thick titanium liquid cells filled with D2O after equilibrium in D2O (24 h). Scattered intensities were reduced, corrected for the transmission and background and placed on absolute scale. Then, circularly averaged to produce absolute scale scattering intensity, I(q), as a function of the wave vector, q, where q ¼ (4p/l)sin(q/2) and q is the scattering angle. Calculations were performed using Igor Pro�software [30,31]. USANS experiments covered a q-range of 0.00005 < q (Å�1) < 0.01, corresponding to a real-space length scale of 0.1 microne10 micron.', '3. Results and discussions', '3.1. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 25 �C', 'SPTES copolymers have high proton conductivity at high relative humidities and elevated temperatures; e.g. 65 �C and 85% RH of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers, respectively [27]. The degree of sulfonation increases for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6%, respectively. SPTES-50 copolymer has the lowest the degree of sulfonation and SPTES-80 copolymer has the highest degree of sulfonation in this class of copolymers [22,27]. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers at 25 �C show a scattering behavior of a two phase structure (Fig. 2a). The contribution of sulfonic groups to the scattering is considered to be negligible due to their small volume compared to the polymer and the water phase volume. It was visually observed that membranes do not dissociate when fully hydrated in the examined temperature. It was also determined by weight measurement that the membranes maintain the weight after deswelling. Therefore, the hydrophobic polymeric structure is the supporting network even at high water content and increased temperatures. Fig. 2a presents enhanced scattering intensity data (vertically shifted) for the hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copol-ymer membranes in the order of 20X, 1000X, and 2 �105X for the clarity of data presentation. The absolute scale scattering intensities in the medium q range of 0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1 are almost in the same intensity range for all SPTES copolymers. The high q scattering spectra for all copolymers exhibit a feature which is attributed to the presence of ionic domains containing water molecules. According to the scattering results, the morphology of all hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C can be approximated as correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates with liquid-like ordering (P.Y. ordering) and a power law decay [29]. The scattering data for the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C were compared and quantified using polydisperse (Schulz polydispersity) hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [32e34] and a low q power law decay [29].

Chemical structure of the highly sulfonated endcapped polyarylenethioethersulfone, SPTES-50, -60, -70, -80 (k ¼ 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8).', 'M. Yoonessi et al. / Polymer 52 (2011) 5615e56215616', 'clarity and completeness of the SPTES series analysis [29]. Fig. 2b shows the experimental scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 25 �C compared with the theoretical calculations of the model (solid line). The results of the comparison of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes scattering data with the model are summarized in Table 1. According to this modeling the domain radius increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 13.45,14.9,15.4, and 16.9 Å for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes. The hard sphere packing density increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 19.8%, 23%, 25%, 29% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. This could indicate that ionic domains are capable of holding more water molecules with the presence of more sulfonic groups on the polymer backbone (increasing the degree of sulfonation). The high-q scattering spectra exhibits onset of a peak formation when the degree of sulfonation was increased to 71.6% for SPTES-80 copolymer. Pres-ence of scattering maxima can be due to the scattering from an ordered structure (periodicity) or the oscillations resulted from the structural factor effects or the excluded volume effect arising from short range liquid-like ordering. The onset of peak formation is attributed to the excluded volume effects related to the liquid-like ordering [33e35]. The low-q power law decay of nearly �3 was observed for all SPTES copolymers in the range of 1 �10�4 < q (1/ Å) < 3 �10�3. The power law decay of �3 is attributed to the presence of interacting three-dimensional fractal morphology. In addition, a Guinier plateau [35] was present for the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer at the very low q (q (1/Å) < 9 �10�5). This is in addition to the nearly identical scattering intensity in the inter-mediate q-range (0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1). It can be concluded that the change in the degree of sulfonation had little or no effect on the intermediate and low angle scattering wave vector. The low-q power law decay was nearly �3 �0.1 for all SPTES copolymers. The presence of sharp interface between hydrophobic and hydro-philic domains was deduced from the power law decay of �4 at large angle wave vectors for all hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes. All scattering data presented in Fig. 2a shows a power slope of �3.85 to �4.15 which is approximated as w �4. The presence of Porod behavior (decay of �4) has been attributed to the two immiscible phase with a sharp boundary [35e37]. This shows that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are separated with a distinct interface containing sulfonic groups. Presence of a plateau in the scattering spectra is characteristics of isolated scatterers [35]. The radius of gyration (Rg) of the isolated scatterers can be approximated by IðqÞ ¼ I0expðð�q2R2gÞ=3Þ, where I0 is the extrapolated zero scattering intensity (Guinier approxi-mation) [35]. Presence of the Guinier plateau in the q range of 4.3 �10�5 < q (1/Å) < 8.2 �10�5 for SPTES-80 copolymer suggests segregation of the isolated large scale hydrophilic water pockets when the degree of sulfonation increased to 71.6%.

Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 55 �C', 'Based on the physical observations, water saturated membranes at 55 �C were swollen films without visual dissociation. Fig. 3 exhibits the scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. The inter-mediate scattering intensity decreased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes start to form scattering maxima at high q range when the degree of sulfonation increased. This indicated the increase in the excluded volume due to the increase in the volume of the scatterers at higher degree of sulfonation and increased temperature (55 �C). The presence of scattering maxima is more significant for SPTES-70 copolymer and SPTES-80 copolymer with 63.3 and 71.6% degree of sulfonation. The large angle scattering feature shows scattering maxima at qmax of 0.103 and 0.1108 1/Å for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers which correspond to spatial characteristics lengths (l ¼ 2p/qmax) of 60.97 and 56.7 Å due to concentration fluctuations of hydrated domains (hard spheres). The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes changed significantlywith increasing degree of sulfonation. This indicates a substantial change in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology with increasing degree of sulfonation at 55 �C which is more pronounced for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers (degree of sulfonation 63.3 and 71.6%, respectively). Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are segregated distinctly by the sulfonic groups at the interface which is repre-sented by the Porod behavior, asymptotic behavior of w �4 for all SPTES copolymers [35e37]. The morphology of these membranes is complex and controlled by interfacial phenomena. The number of sulfonic groups per repeat unit volume and their acidity com-plemented with the chain persistent length and chain mobility are governing factors in the formed morphology. This study approxi-mates the morphology of the fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55 �C are approximated as spherical nanodomains containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering similar to their morphology at 25 �C. It is also proposed that this morphology changedtofractalmorphologywithincreasing temperature (increasing the intermediate scattering decay). The domain radius and the sphere packing density were increased from 26.4 Å and 28% for SPTES-50 copolymer to 32 Å and 33% for SPTES-60copolymerwhiletheintermediatescatteringintensity decreased. The domain radius and packing density of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane increased from 13.45 Å and 19.8% to 26.4 Å and 28% when the temperature increased from 25 �C to 55 �C with this approximation. The same increasing trend of 14.9 Åe32 Å for the average domain radius and 23%e33% of the sphere packing density was observed. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane compared to the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane is attributed to the disruption of the large scale morphology. The low q power law decay of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane was close to the decay of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane. The increase in the degree of sulfonation of SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymers from 54.9, to 63.3 and 71.6% resulted in a shift in the position of the high q scattering maxima of the hydrated membranes toward the large angle scattering regime. This peak formation is more prominent for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copoly-mers with higher sulfonation degree. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering intensity in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70 and', '-80 copolymers is attributed to the loss of the large scale water network, intermediate fractal morphology within the polymer and onset of a morphology change to a two large scale phase morphology. The closed domain morphology of polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with fractal network were present for fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55�C (Figs. 3 and 4a). However, substantialchangesinthemorphologyoffullyhydrated membranes occurred when the degree of sulfonation is increased to 63.3 and 71.6% for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers at higher temperature of 55 �C. Combination of high temperature, high density of sulfonic groups, and significant amount of water mole-cules within the polymer backbone could have resulted in the coalescence of the small spherical ionic domains and fractal water network into a larger scale bicontinuous network of intermeshed hydrophobic and hydrophilic morphology for fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane at 55 �C. The bicontinuous model origi-nally proposed for micro-emulsion of two immiscible phases of water and oil with comparable amount based on Landau theory [38,39]. This model describes two irregular shapes with distinct boundary and has been used for intermesh of hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure when the particle shape is not well-defined [40,41]. This model proposes I(q) ¼ (a2þc1q þ c2q2)�1 for a2 > 0, c1 < 0, and c2 > 0, a single broad scattering maxima, and power law decay of �4 at large scattering angles. Two characteristics lengths of d and x are deduced from this analysis having a2, c1, and c2[39,40], d is the domain periodicity or interdomain distance and x is the correlation length which has been attributed to the dispersion of d. According to this theory, c1 is negative due to the surfactant. The absolute values of c1 and the ratio of x/d should increase with increasing surfactant. The specific internal surface area can be derived from the ratio of S/V ¼ 44(1�4)/x [38,39]. The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane has a low-q upturn, a lower intermediate scattering intensity compared to the hydrated SPTES-60 and SPTES-50 copolymers, and a large angle maxima followed by a power law decay of �4. This indicates the onset of the coalescence of the ionic aggregates, disruption of the fractal water network, and the formation of the two irregular large scale bicontinuous phase morphology. The high q range (q > 0.037 1/Å) of the scattering', 'Fig. 3. Scattering spectra of fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES copolymers at 55 �C. The high q scattering exhibit a power law decay of �4. High q range maxima position of hydrated SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 shifts toward higher q with increasing degree of sulfonation.', 'M. Yoonessi et al. / Polymer 52 (2011) 5615e56215618', 'spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 55 �C was compared with the T.S. bicontinuous model (Fig. 4b). This simulation resulted in a periodicity, d, of 59.9 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima position, 60.97 Å. According to this simulation, the correlation length (x) is 31.14 Å. The medium-q range scattering still exhibits the larger scale morphology which is not completely converted to the bi-continuous phase morphology. However, they are partially collapsed characterized by a lower scattering intensity in the intermediate q range. The high q maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 is approximated as bicontinuous morphology. The low and medium q (q < 0.037 1/Å) scattering spectra of the SPTES 70 is due to the presence of fractal network of waters which have not coalesce yet. The scattering spectra of the SPTES-80 copolymer are consistent with a bicontinuous two phase structure of irregular shapes with sulfonic groups as interfacial ionic region. The scattering experi-mental data of the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was compared with this model (q > 0.015 1/Å), (Fig. 4c and Table 2). The periodicity of the water domains (or hydrophobic domains), d, predicted by this model is w54 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima (qmax), 56.7 Å. This value is the distance between water domains. The correlation length (x) obtained from this model is 37.86 Å which is a measure of dispersion. The distance between the water phases, periodicity, was decreased from 59.9 Å to 54 Å with increasing degree of sulfona-tion. The correlation length, x, was increased from 31.14 Å to 37.86 Å when the degree of sulfonation increased. Increasing the interfacial area results in an increase in the x/d ratio. The presence of the upturn in the low range of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 at 55 �C (Fig. 4b and c) is attributed to the fractal morphology of the large scale features.', '3.3. Discussions', 'Scattering data of series of SPTES membranes were obtained in the full hydration state with increasing the sulfonation degree in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. Complete study was performed to provide understanding membranes morphology with increasing the temperature of the hydrated membranes from 25 �C to 55 �C. Proposed model assumes spherical nanodomains containing water molecules forming from clustering of the sulfonation groups. This assumption was performed based on previously reported study which showed spherical nanodomains in the dry SPTES 50 membrane under HR-TEM [29]. The scattering spectra of the membranes with high degree of sulfonation (SPTES 70, and 80) changed significantly when the temperature increased to 55 �C. The morphology is approximated as bi-continuous system where the hydrocarbon is the main support network containing water. This model has been recently proposed by Wnek et al. [40], Gebel [8], and Kreuer [12], Wnek also provided visualization of the hydro-phobic cluster using SYBYL version 6.7 (Tripos) and HINT (Hydro-pathicINTeractions)computationalmodelingsoftware[40]. Despite the support of the transport studies of this model [42],', 'Fig. 4.

Bicontinuous model was compared with SANS spectra in the q range of (q > 0.0371/Å). 4c) Experimental scattering data of fullyhydrated SPTES-80 (B) at 55 �C compared with Tuebner Strey bicontinuous phase model.', 'Table 2 Structural characteristics of fully hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 at 55�C described by Tubnet Strey model.', 'Materiald (Å)x (Å)x/dl (Å)', 'Hydrated Membranes at 55 �C SPTES-7059.9 �0.231.1 �0.40.5261 �0.3 SPTES-80w54 �0.337.8 �0.60.756.7 �0.2', 'M. Yoonessi et al. / Polymer 52 (2011) 5615e56215619', 'there is no direct visualization method for this proposed approxi-mation. The T. S. model is also supported by high proton conduc-tivity of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 membranes at 55 �C where a larger number of hydronium ions in a larger domain can facilitate proton transport. A summary of the structural evolution of the SPTES membranes as a function of temperature and degree of sulfonation is illustrated in Table 3. This study attempted to study a full range of SPTES membrane nanostructure for the first time and provide an understanding of large membrane water uptakes, and their morphology and their relation with high conductivity of the membranes using both liquid like ordering of polydisperse nano-spheres and bi-continuous T.S. model approximation.', '4. Conclusions', 'A series of SPTES copolymers with high proton conductivity of 100e215 mS/cm at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity as potential fuel cells membranes were studied. SANS studies of fully hydrated membranes showed that the nanostructure of the fully hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C in agreement with ionic aggregates containing water molecules with a large scale morphology network of water pockets morphology. This model predicted that the increase in the degree of sulfonation resulted in an increase in the radius of ionic domains and an increase in the volume packing density of water in the aggregates. It was assumed that the same morphology of polydisperse correlated spherical ionic domains were present in the SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymers when the temperature increased to 55 �C. Increase in the degree of sulfonation for fully hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer at 55 �C led to a substantial reorganization of the membrane morphology which was described by a bi-continuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic network.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors would like to thank the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Nano-structured andBiological Materials Branch forfunding this research.

Moreover, the dilution condition should be applied to suppress the concurrent chain extension. In consequence, this bimolecular process is now', 'recognized as a less attractive choice for the preparation of cyclic polymers in practice (Scheme 1A). A significantly improved means by an alternative unimolecular process has subsequently been introduced to prepare cyclic polymers (Scheme 1B). It was first demonstrated by using an asymmetrically functional telechelic precursor, a-acetal-u-styryl polystyrene,7 and the subsequent end-to-end polymer cyclization through the deprotection/activation treatment. This unimolecular process with asymmetrically functional telechelic precursors has been extended by employing alternative pairs of the reactive groups. Thus, an a-amino-u-carboxyl polystyrene and poly(tert-butyl acrylate) were prepared through a living polymerization using an initiator having a protected amino group, followed by the end-capping reaction to introduce a carboxylic group.8 The resulting asymmetric telechelic precursor underwent, after the deprotection, an intramolecular amidation reaction to give a ring polymer product effectively. Alternatively, an a-(furan-pro-tected)-maleimide-u-cyclopentadienylpoly(methylmethacry-late) and poly(tert-butyl acrylate) were prepared through the ATRP using a protected maleimide initiator and the subsequent introduction of a cyclopentadienyl group at the living end with the nickelocene methodology.9 The obtained asymmetric tele-chelic precursor was subjected to the heat treatment to cause the spontaneous deprotection followed by an intramolecular Diels–Alder addition reaction to give a ring polymer product effectively.9 It is notable, however, that these processes using telechelic precursors having potentially reactive groups require multistep protection/deprotection treatments. A versatile unimolecular process has recently been introduced by employing a click reaction using asymmetrically functional telechelic polystyrene having an alkyne and an azide group.10 The introduction of these two functional groups at the polymer chain-ends could be performed conveniently, and they can react with each other upon the addition of a Cu catalyst.11 Therefore, this click polymer cyclization has been applied to prepare such functional ring polymers, as poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide)12,13', 'and poly(caprolactone)14 as well as poly(valerolactone)15 to elucidate their topology-effect on phase transition, and on biodegradation, respectively, detailed in the later section. This unimolecular click process has also been employed to construct complex cyclic structures, either having multiple polymer segment components16 or having multicyclic as well as cyclic/ linear hybrid polymer segments.17 On the other hand, the bimo-lecular click process using an azide-ended bifunctional telechelic precursor and a bifunctional alkyne compound as a linking reagentproceedslesseffectivelythantheunimolecular counterpart.18', 'Another effective unimolecular process has been developed using symmetrically functional telechelic precursors, which are readily obtainable through a direct end-capping reaction of living bifunctional polymers (Scheme 1C).18–23 Thus, telechelic poly(tetrahydrofuran), poly(acrylic ester) and poly(isobutene) having olefinic end groups were prepared through the relevant living polymerization followed by the end-capping reaction. The subsequent metathesis condensation, i.e., metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC), in the presence of a Grubbs catalyst pro-ceeded effectively to give the corresponding ring polymers in high yields even under dilution.18–20 This MPC process has further been applied for the practical synthesis of amphiphilic cyclic', 'Scheme 1Ring polymer synthesis by (A) a bimolecular process, (B) a unimolecular process with asymmetric telechelics, (C) a unimolecular process with symmetric telechelics, (D) a ring-expansion polymerization process and (E) an electrostatic self-assembly and covalent fixation (ESA-CF) process.', 'This journal is ª The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011Polym.

This process does not require dilution in contrast to the end-to-end polymer cyclization process by linear polymer precursors, while a reactive initiator fragment is inherently included in the final ring polymer structure. Thus until recently, the ring-expansion process has been considered as a less practical means, since it is not an easy task to maintain the ring topology of the product while eliminating the initiator residues.26', 'A number of new processes have recently been developed to address this problem in the ring-expansion polymerization (Scheme 2). Thus, a new Ru catalyst bearing a cyclic ligand containing the Ru-alkylidene unit has been introduced and applied for the ring-expansion polymerization of cyclic olefins such as 1,5-cyclooctadiene or cyclooctene.27 During the chain-growth process, the chain transfer to the Ru-alkylidene unit took place to eliminate the initiator complex, and consequently a ring polybutadiene or a ring poly(cyclooctene) free of the catalyst fragment, respectively, is produced. The obtained ring poly(cyclooctene)wasthenhydrogenatedtogivearing polyethylene, showing distinctive properties in comparison with commercial linear polyethylenes (Scheme 2A).27,28 It is notable,', 'at the same time, that the random nature of this chain transfer process inherently causes the broadening of the molecular weight distribution of the product. This process has now been applied with a bulky, dendronized monomer to construct a ring nano-object directly observable by atomic force microscopy (AFM).29', 'More recently, a new N-heterocyclic carbene initiator was introduced for the ring-expansion polymerization of lactones or lactide to form ring polyesters or polylactide, respectively (Scheme 2B).30,31 Remarkably, the obtained ring polymers possess narrow molecular weight distributions through the elimination of the initiator fragment after the quantitative consumption of the monomer, in contrast to the metathesis ring-expansion process shown before.28 By exploiting the living character, this technique has subsequently been applied for the synthesis of ring block polypeptoids and of complex topological polymers having a ring with many branches, i.e., jellyfish poly-mers.32,33 A further development of the ring-expansion process would provide a wider variety of chemical structures in ring polymers by broadening the choice of monomer types. The combination of the classical ring-expansion polymeriza-tion process, in which the initiator fragment is included within the ring polymer structure, with the end-to-end polymer cycli-zation process could provide a new effective means for ring polymers having, in particular, large sizes (Scheme 2C).34 Thus, a ring poly(caprolactone) having short photocrosslinkable block segments was prepared through a sequential living ring-expan-sion polymerization using a cyclic stannate initiator. The subsequent irradiation under dilution caused the intramolecular covalent linking of the two short segments.

It is remarkable, moreover, that a small portion of nanoobjects corresponding to complex ring polymers having tadpole, 8-shaped, catenated and knotted forms were also identified. This showed, for the first time, that not only single-cyclic but also various complex cyclic polymer topologies are indeed produced through the polymer cyclization process, as previously shown in DNA systems.37', 'An electrostatic self-assembly and covalent fixation (ESA-CF) process has been introduced for the effective synthesis of not only cyclic but also functionalized cyclic and multicyclic polymers, where linear or star telechelic polymers having cyclic ammonium salt groups accompanying small or polymeric plurifunctional carboxylate counteranions are employed as key precursors (Scheme 1E).38–40 Various telechelic polymers have been conve-niently prepared through the relevant living polymerization fol-lowed by the end-capping/end-conversion technique. The choice of such particular types of cyclic ammonium salt end groups as five- and six-membered cyclic ammonium, i.e., N-phenyl-pyrrolidinium and N-phenylpiperidinium salt groups, respec-tively, is of a crucial importance in the ESA-CF process (Scheme 3).41 The former undergoes upon heating a selective ring-opening reaction by a carboxylate counteranion to form an amino ester group through the nucleophilic attack exclusively at the N-adjacent ring (endo) position. On the other hand, the latter having unstrained six-membered cyclic ammonium salt groups gives a chemically more stable, simple ester group through the nucleophilic attack at the alternative N-adjacent (exo) position, to eliminate N-phenylpiperidine. And in the electrostatic polymer self-assembly, the cations at the end of the telechelics and the anions in the carboxylates counteranions always balance the charges. Upon the dilution, the self-assembly tends to dissociate into one having the smallest number of polymer components by keeping the balance of the charges (Scheme 4). Thus, when a self-assembly comprised of', 'a linear telechelic precursor, typically poly(THF), having cyclic ammonium salt groups accompanying either a dicarboxylate or a tetracarboxylate counteranion was heated at dilution, the selective ring-opening reaction of the cyclic ammonium groups took place to produce single-cyclic (ring) or dicyclic (8-shaped) polymerproducts,respectively,inhighyields.38,42Ring poly(THF)s having the molecular weights of up to 10 000, cor-responding to the ring size of as high as 700 atoms, were obtainable and characterized unequivocally by the MALDI-TOF mass technique. Furthermore, the ESA-CF process with dynamic equilibrium nature has been exploited to construct various multicyclic as well as cyclic-linear hybrid polymer topologies (Scheme 5).6', 'Moreover, ring polymers possessing the prescribed functional groups at the designated positions, i.e., kyklo-telechelics and cyclic macromonomer, have also been prepared by employing telechelic precursors possessing such functional groups as hydroxyl, olefinic, acetylenic, and azide groups at the designated, typically a center, position by using the relevant initiator, or by introducing functional linking reagents.43 They were subse-quently applied to construct more complex polymer topologies either through the covalent linkage or even through the non-covalent, mechanical linkage uniquely formed by threading with ring polymer units.44,45 It was also shown that network polymers formed from cyclic polymer precursors exhibited unique gel properties compared with conventional gels obtained with linear/ branched polymer precursors.46 Moreover, the topological conversion of polymers between ring/linear and even between single-cyclic/dicyclic topologies has now been achieved.45,47,48', 'By the combination of the ESA-CF protocol with selective covalent linking chemistry, a wide variety of multi-cyclic as well as cyclic-linear conjugated polymers have been synthesized.49 In particular, the combination of the ESA-CF process with the metathesis condensation and with the click process has now been revealed as a versatile means to construct a variety of complex multicyclic polymer topologies of fused-, spiro- and bridged forms (Scheme 6).50 Both the functional ring polymer precursors and thecovalentlylinkedmulticyclicpolymerproductwere unequivocally characterized by means of a series of spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques including MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy and SEC.

Thus, the Tg of ring polymers is higher than the linear counter-part, until the polymer chain length becomes long enough to diminish the contribution of the chain end. On the contrary, the hydrodynamic volume or the melt viscosity of ring polymers is inherently smaller than their linear counterparts irrespective of their chain lengths. This indicates the distinctive conception in the topology effect by ring polymers. The latter is regarded as an inherent topology effect by ring polymers, while the former as the depletion effect of the polymer chain ends. Nevertheless, the elimination of the chain ends of polymer molecules inevitably leads to the formation of cyclic constructions to bring the topology effect, now drawing increasing interests to discover unusual properties and functions in polymer materials covering mechanical, thermal, electric, photonic and bio-related applica-tions either in bulk or at surface.

Indeed, a collaborative simulation and experimental study on the liquid chromatography study has been conducted on multi-cyclic polymers, and could provide a basis for the purification and the characterization of polymers having complex topologies.58', 'Scheme 5Various multicyclic and cyclic-linear hybrid polymer topologies constructed by the ESA-CF process.', '1934 | Polym.

These results are consistent with the geometric estimation of the size of the micelles, corresponding to the Nw, rt, and rh, which is dependent on the continuous chain length of the hydrophobic segment in the block copolymers. And, those in the cyclic AB and the linear ABA block copolymers are estimated as a half of that in the linear AB counterpart employed in this study. Moreover, the cyclic AB block copolymer tends to constitute a stiff hairpin-like conformation, resulting in a slightly larger hydrophobic core within the micelle compared to that with the linear ABA coun-terpart having free chain ends. The enthalpy of micellization (DmicH�) was also smaller with the cyclic AB block copolymer than that with the corresponding linear ABA counterpart, presumably because the segmental flip-flop is inhibited in the micelle with the former, in contrast to the motional freedom by the latter having free chain ends. This also agrees with the smaller entropy of micellization (DmicS�) with the cyclic AB block copolymer than with the linear counterpart. More recently, a significant topology effect has been revealed in the thermal stability of the micelle formed with cyclic AB block copolymers in comparison with the linear ABA and even with the linear AB counterparts.68 Notably, a variety of relevant cyclic lipids, thus a type of surfactants, have been discovered in the cell membrane of thermophilic archaea, single-cell microorganisms, surviving in the hostile environment of very high-temperatures located at hot springs and submarine volcanoes.69 Thus, an amphiphilic cyclic AB block copolymer, comprised of poly(butyl acrylate)/poly(ethylene oxide) segments, was prepared. The unimolecular, metathesis polymer cyclization (MPC) process was employed using a linear ABA block copolymer precursor having olefinic end groups (Scheme 9B).21', 'The obtained cyclic and the relevant linear block copolymers were allowed to form the corresponding micelles, in which their cmc’s and the number-average hydrodynamic volumes (Dh) were measured to be closely comparable to each other (Fig. 5).68 The size and morphology of the micelles with either block copolymers were directly observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 6) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 6) to show commonly flower-like spherical shapes possessing the consistent diameters determined by DLS (Scheme 10). Remarkably, the thermal stability of the micelles was drasti-cally enhanced using the cyclic block copolymer. Thus, the', 'corresponding micelle solutions were heated from 20�C in a stepwise fashion (Fig. 7), and the micelle with the linear ABA block copolymer became turbid at around 25 �C, while that with the cyclic AB counterpart was stable till above 70 �C.68', 'Based on the large deviation of the clouding point (Tc) among the micelles either solely with cyclic or with linear block copol-ymers, the tuning of the Tc of the micelle was achieved by the coassembly of both the linear and cyclic block copolymers.68', 'Thus, the Tc was systematically altered along with the relative contents of the cyclic and the linear block copolymer compo-nents in the micelle, as shown in Fig. 7.68 This topology effect will be utilized to design temperature-responsive devices encapsu-lating and releasing appropriate components in and from the micelle.

A number of recent studies are presented in this section, covering a diverse field either by conjugated cyclic oligomers,70 by photo-responsive ring polymers,71,72 by biodegradable ring polyesters,14', 'by temperature-responsive ring polymers,12,13or by pharmaco-logically functional ring polymers.73', 'Conjugated polymers and oligomers have currently been extensively studied primarily due to their potential for diverse electronic and photonic applications.74 Ring-shaped conjugated polymers and oligomers have attracted particular interests as a prototype of the molecularly fabricated electric circuit, since the circulation of electrons/holes might be induced along the ‘‘endless’’ conjugated segments. A wide variety of conjugated ring oligomers possessing the increasing numbers of unsaturated groups have thus been prepared to test their electrochemical properties.70 Fully conjugated large ring polymers, on the other hand, have still been an elusive synthetic challenge. It is notable, moreover, that a twisted, Moebius stripe-like conjugated olig-omer has attracted considerable interests because of their unusual non-H€uckel aromaticity, in contrast to the conventional H€uckel-type aromaticity which is dependent on its planar geometry by conjugated units.75', 'Photo-response behaviors could be influenced by polymer topologies of either ring or linear forms. Thus, a ring polymer having photo-responsive azobenzene units in the main chain was prepared through the bimolecular end-to-end cyclization via click chemistry.71 Upon the irradiation of UV light, both the trans-to-cis and the cis-to-trans isomerization proceeded slightly faster by the ring polymer in comparison with the linear counterpart. This behavior was attributed to the higher topo-logical constraint of the former than the latter counterpart.71 As another example, a ring polystyrene having two photoactive groups, namely fluorene and anthracene units, was prepared through the bimolecular process using a living bifunctional polystyrene produced with an initiator having a fluorene unit and a linking reagent having an anthracene unit.72 The fluo-rescent behavior of the obtained ring polymer was subsequently studied to show the intramolecular energy migration between the two chromophores.72', 'Naturally occurring ring polymers, such as cyclic DNAs, cyclic peptides as well as cyclic polysaccharides,3 and multi-cyclic counterparts like cyclotides,76 are known to exhibit higher stability against biologically induced decomposition. In this relevance, the topology effect of aliphatic biodegradable poly-esters on their decomposition behavior has been investigated.14', 'Thus, ring poly(caprolactone) was prepared through the unim-olecular click polymer cyclization using the corresponding precursor having an azide and an alkyne group. The higher hydrolytic stability was then observed in comparison with the linear counterparts.14 Notably, moreover, such biodegradable ring polyesters by poly(valerolactone) and by poly(lactide) were also prepared.15,30,31,77', 'Temperature-responsivepropertiesofpoly(N-iso-propylacrylamide), poly(NIPAM), have extensively been studied for their eventual uses in the controlled release devices and for the cell–sheet applications.78 The two groups recently reported the topology effects by ring poly(NIPAM)s.12,13 Thus, the two groups prepared linear poly(NIPAM) precursors having alkyne and azide end groups either by a reversible addition–fragmen-tation chain transfer (RAFT) or by an atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) technique, and the unimolecular click process was commonly applied for the subsequent polymer cyclization. The cloud point (TCP) of the obtained ring poly(NIPAM) by one group was several degrees higher than that of the corresponding linear counterpart. In addition, they observed that the phase transition by the ring polymers took place distinctively slower upon heating.12 Another group, on the other hand, observed the ring poly(NIPAM) showing a few degrees lower TCP against the linear counterpart at the higher solution concentration, while higher at the lower solution concentration. Furthermore, they reported the smaller enthalpy change (DH) during the phase transition with the ring poly (NIPAM). These results were accounted for by the suppression of the hydrogen bond interaction between the ring poly(NIPAM) with water molecules due to their topological constraints in comparison with the flexible linear counterpart having free chain ends.13', 'A pharmacological application of ring polymers has recently been demonstrated by elucidating the filtration/elimination mechanism of a kidney through its nanoporous channel.73 Thus, it was anticipated that the ring polymer could remain longer in a body than the linear counterpart, since the former should be reluctant to transform its conformation into a folded shape to traverse through the nanoporous channels of the kidney.73 To test this topology effect, a series of linear and cyclic poly(capro-lactone)s having poly(ethylene glycol) graft segments and having phenolic functionalities for radiolabeling by 125I were prepared. The lower secretion into urine and in turn the higher accumu-lation in various organs was indeed confirmed with the ring polymer having an appropriate molecular weight, corresponding to its hydrodynamic volume.73 These findings may provide new design methodologies for drug carriers and imaging agents via the topology-based control of a blood circulation time.', '7.Conclusions and future perspectives', 'In this review, we have shown a variety of recent achievements in topological polymer chemistry, to focus on novel polymer', 'Fig. 7The thermal stability of the micelles solely with the linear and with the cyclic block copolymers, and also with the coassembly by both components.

R.  China  2 Faculty of Chemistry, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, 130023, P. R.  China     (Received: 21 May, 2007; published: 10 September, 2007)', 'Abstract: We reported a chemical approach for the in-situ preparation of  conducting polyaniline (PANI)/Fe2O3 composite dispersions using dodecylbenzene  sulfonic (DBSA) acid both as dopant and surfactant. The PANI/Fe2O3 composite  dispersions were characterized by X-ray diffraction, UV-vis and FT-IR spectra and  conductivity measurement. The dispersions showed good stability and existed  without precipitate for at least half a year. The gas-sensing behavior of the  composite film to 100 ppm of NH3 was studied through monitoring the change of  the resistance. Keywords: PANI/Fe2O3 composite, dispersions, dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid', 'Introduction', 'Recently, polymeric composites containing metal oxides have attracted a great deal  of attention from researchers because they frequently exhibit unexpected hybrid  properties synergistically derived from both components [1-4]. Meanwhile, they  exhibit interesting properties with many applications such as quantum electronic  devices, gas sensors, capacitors, conducting paints and rechargeable batteries [5-8].  Composites of polyaniline (PANI) have been widely studied in view of their unique  electrical, dielectrical, optical and optoelectrical properties in addition to their easy  preparation and excellent environmental stability [9-12]. However, the poor solubility  limits their application as conducting materials. To overcome this obstacle,  functionalized protonic acids such as dedecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) or  camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) have been used to dope PANI and the obtained  conducting products were soluble in many kinds of solvents [13-14].', 'On the other hand, composite of PANI and iron oxides (Fe2O3 or Fe3O4) has been  extensively investigated because of their unique magnetic properties and application  prospects in technology [15-24]. But most of the composites were in powder state;  therefore, the processes to prepare film for application in devices are complicated. In  our experiment, we prepare the conducting PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions in  aqueous solution by one step, and the so-obtained PANI/Fe2O3 composite  dispersions can be directly used to prepare conducting films and hence make  different devices.', 'In our former work, we have investigated the formation of the PANI dispersions under  different preparation conductions by changing the concentration of surfactant, aniline,  acid and the ratio of aniline to ammonium persulphate (APS) [25]. In this study, we', '1', 'chose the optimum conditions considering the above factors to prepare the  PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions by in-situ polymerization using DBSA both as  dopant and surfactant. The dispersions of PANI/Fe2O3 composite could exist without  any precipitate for at least half a year. In addition, it can be diluted by distilled water  for many times without generation of precipitate, indicating their high stability or  nearly solution characteristic. The structure and conductivity of the composite was  studied by X-ray, UV-vis and FT-IR spectra, and four-probe technology. The gas-sensing behavior of the film prepared by directly spinning the dispersions on silicon  chip was studied.   Results and discussion  Formation', 'As for the formation of the dispersions, we assumed that the Fe2O3 particles were  dispersed in water aqueous solution and it would act as ‘seed’ to induce the  polymerization of aniline. In our experiment, the Fe2O3 particles were homogeneously  dispersed in the reaction system because DBSA with hydrophilic group acted as  surfactant. Then the aniline monomer contacted with Fe2O3 nearly at the same time,  which could accelerate the induction time of polymerization [26]. This effect could be  observed by monitoring the change of the solution temperature as shown in Fig. 1.  From Fig. 1, we can see that the time for the seed polymerization to start was about  300 s (Fig. 1b) while without Fe2O3 particles was about 3300 s along (Fig. 1a).', 'Fig. 1. Temperature change during the induction time.', 'XRD pattern', 'The XRD pattern of PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions is shown in Fig. 2. In the  pattern, the 2θ at 35.6, 43.4, 53.6, 57.3, and 62.8 o are contributed to γ-Fe2O3, and  33.08, 40.78 and 49.42 o are related to α-Fe2O3. The broad peaks at about 19.9 and  24.1 o are characteristic peaks of PANI [27]. These results indicate that the', '2', 'PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions contain two different phases of the Fe2O3  particles, and the PANI is amorphous in the composite.', 'Fig. 2. XRD pattern of the PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions.   UV-vis spectra', 'Fig. 3. UV-vis spectra of PANI (a) and PANI/Fe2O3 composite (b) dispersions.    The UV-vis absorption spectra of PANI and the PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions  are shown in Fig. 3. A typical absorption spectrum of PANI dispersions has three', '3', 'distinct absorption peaks at 351, 436, and 757 nm, respectively (Fig. 3a). The peak  at 351 nm arises from π-π* electron transition within benzenoid segments, the peak  at 436 nm is due to the polaron state and the wide peak at 757 nm is related to the  doping level [28]. Compared to the PANI dispersions, the absorption peak of  PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions show little difference, for example, the peak at  757 nm shifts to 746 nm (Fig. 3b). The shift may be originated from the decreasing  doping level by the addition of Fe2O3.  FT-IR spectra', 'The FT-IR spectra of PANI and PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions are shown in Fig.  4. From Fig. 4a, we can find the characteristic peaks of PANI: the peak at 684 cm-1 is  usually assigned to the C-H out of plane bending in 1, 2 ring in intrinsic PANI; the  peak at 1083 cm-1 stands for the C-H aromatic in-plane bending on 1, 4 ring; the  peak at 1183 cm-1 may be assigned to the carbon skeleton, and the peak of 1311 cm-', '1 is contributed to C-N stretching mode. The strong peak at 1459 cm-1 is related to  C=C stretching mode of the benzenoid ring and a weak peak of quionoid ring at 1548  cm-1 means the high doping degree of the PANI [29]. And from Fig. 4b, we can see  that when the Fe2O3 particles present in the dispersion, the intensity of the peak at  1459 cm-1 is decreased and shift to 1461 cm-1, which represents the decrease of  doping degree of the PANI. There may be some interaction between the lone pair  electrons of N atom in PANI chains with 3d orbit of Fe atom, which could reduce the  energy level interval of aromatic nucleus. This also caused the UV-vis absorption  band of composite dispersions to have a red shift [30].', 'Fig. 4. FT-IR spectra of PANI (a) and PANI/Fe2O3 composite (b) dispersions.   Conductivity', 'Table 1 shows the conductivity values measured by using four-probe technology at  25 0C. Compared to pure PANI, the conductivity of PANI/Fe2O3 composite with Fe2O3  content of 0.05 g increases from 0.98 to 1.07μS/cm. This may be attributed to the  doping effect associated with Fe2O3 particles that are believed to help induce the  formation of a more efficient network for change transport, thus enhancing the', '4', 'conductivity of the composite [31]. However, with increasing the content of Fe2O3, the  relative contents of the conducting polymer are decreased, resulting in the decrease  of the corresponding conductivity. The decrease may be attributed to two factors: (a)  the insulating behavior of the Fe2O3 particles in the core of the composites; (b) a  decrease of doping degree as the UV-vis and FT-IR spectra show [32].

The response time of the composite film is 40 s. It can be applied to the detection of  ammonia, and the further study of the sensitivity to NH3 and other gases is under  way.', '5', 'Stability', 'The stability of the dispersions with different content of Fe2O3 particles was studied.  When the content of Fe2O3 particles in the dispersions was lower than 0.05 g, the  dispersions show good stability and existed without precipitate at least half a year.  However, when the content was beyond 0.05 g, there were some precipitates on the  bottom of the dispersion and the quantity of the precipitates increased with the  content of Fe2O3.   Conclusions', 'PANI/Fe2O3 dispersions were prepared using DBSA both as dopant and surfactant.  The XRD, UV-vis and FT-IR characterization indicated that there is some interaction  between the PANI and Fe2O3. The conductivity of the dispersions increased when a  little of Fe2O3 particles were added and decreased in line when a great quantity of  Fe2O3 were added. The dispersions showed good stability and existed without  precipitate for at least half a year. A film were prepared by directly spinning the  PANI/Fe2O3 dispersions on a chip of silicon to study the gas-sensing of100ppm NH3;  the response time is only 40 s and further study of the sensitivity to the NH3 is under  way.    Experimental  Materials', 'Aniline was freshly distilled under reduced pressure and other chemicals were used  as received without further purification. Fe2O3 particles were synthesized by  coprecipitation.    Preparation of PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersion', 'PANI/Fe2O3 composite dispersions were prepared using an in-situ polymerization  method. A typical experiment was done as follows: 0.465 g of aniline was dispersed  into 100 ml of DBSA aqueous solution (0.2 M) under stirring, after which 0.1 g of  Fe2O3 was added into the above solution under ultrasonic. APS in powder state was  then added into the mixture solution. The dispersions of PANI/Fe2O3 composite were  obtained after stirring for 1 h. The PANI dispersions were prepared by the same  approach in absence of Fe2O3. Acetone damaging dispersions were centrifuged and  washed with distilled water, ethanol and acetone three times, respectively. The  resulting powder were dried under reduced pressure at room temperature and then  used for XRD and conductivity measurements.   Characterization', 'The composite dispersions was spun onto a chip of silicon and dried under 60 oC in  order to remove the solvent and form a film for the UV-vis and FT-IR spectra  measurement and study NH3 gas-sensing behavior. UV-vis and FT-IR spectra were  recorded on a UV 3100 spectrometer and on FT-IR-8400s (Shimadzu) spectrometer,  respectively. The conductivity measurements were made by the conventional four-probe (SDY-5) method on pressed pellets of the composite powders prepared at  ambient temperature (25 oC). The gas-sensing behavior, which could be reflected by  the resistance change of the resulting PANI/Fe2O3 composite film upon exposure to  100 ppm of NH3, was monitored with a digital multimeter (DT9205).', '6', 'References', '[1] Su S.J.; Kuramoto N.

And polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared through radical polymerization of 1-vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface-vinylated nanoparticles. The polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were utilized as a functional additive to prepare PPBI/polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. Imida-zole and sulfonated vinylbenzene groups on the surface of modified nanoparticles forming linkages with PPBI chains, improved the compatibility between PPBI and nanoparticles, and enhanced the mechanical strength of the prepared nanocomposite membranes. The prepared nanocomposite membranes showed higher water uptake and acid doping levels comparing to PPBI. Also, after acid doping with phosphoric acid, nanocomposite membranes exhibited enhanced proton conductivity in comparison to the pristine PPBI and PPBI/un-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. The enhancement in proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes resulted from modified SiO2 nanoparticles showed higher conductivity than modified TiO2 nanoparticles. The above results indicated that the PPBI/modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for medium temperature fuel cells. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.', '1. Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang-', '∗Corresponding author.

Sulfonated polysulfone (PSF) [4], polyetheretherketone (PEEK) [5,6] and polybenzimidazoles (PBIs) [7–11] are among poly-mers which can be used as alternatives for Nafion in PEFCs. Amongpolybenzimidazolederivatives,poly[2,2-5,5(m-phenylene)-bibenzimidazole](PBI),whichisalsocalled commercial polybenzimidazole have been used as a mem-brane material in PEMFCs. Having high chemical as well as thermal resistance and proton conductivity, polybenzimidazoles are great options to be used in the fuel cells with function at elevated temperatures above 100 ◦C [12]. PBIs should have enough proton conductivity so that it could be used as proton exchange membranes in the fuel cells. To achieve this purpose, they are usually doped with a sufficient acid like H3PO4 to an appropriate doping level [13]. Nanocomposite membranes are a new group of membranes which contain nanopar-ticles such as SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 and other compounds [14–21]. The introduction of nanoparticles into the membranes results in a considerable improvement in their features like mechani-cal properties, methanol permeability, but in some cases leads to a decrease in proton conductivity [22–24]. In order to over-come this problem, surface functionalized nanoparticles, which means various compounds with polar groups grafted chemically', '0378-7753/$ – see front matter © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

As men-tioned before, the numerous research works were done concerning grafting various compounds on the SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles which used for different purposes. However, in this work, we have used monomer bearing functional groups like imidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene which can improve the properties of pro-ton conductive membranes. These monomers are polymerized on the surface of the nanoparticles and as a consequence, they can more affect the properties of the membranes than while one functional group is grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. In addition, the polymerization of the selected monomers such as vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface of nanoparticle could cause more compatibility between nanopar-ticles and polymer matrix which finally improve the mechanical properties. In this work, nanocomposite membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles and newly synthesized polybenzimidazole was depicted poly[2,2-5,5-(m-pyrazolidene)-bibenzimidazole] (PPBI). Modification of the mentioned nanoparticles was performed by radical polymerization of some vinyl monomers such as sulfonated styrene and vinylim-idazole on the surface of the nanoparticles to which vinylic group was bounded covalently.

These prove the existence of polymeric chains that are grafted onto the nanoparticle surface. FT-IR spectra of the modified nanoparticles have been measured after complete washing and drying. To be sure of the chemical bonding of all chains (not physical) onto the particle surface, some un-modified nanoparticles were mixed with polymeric solutions of PVI and PSV and were stirred for 1 h. After filtration, the washing method used to wash the modified nanoparticles, was applied to the resulting powder as well. The FT-IR spectrum of the obtained powder did not show any absorbent bands related to PVI and PSV chains. The absorbent bands, which existed in the spectrum of mod-ified nanoparticles, were not observed in this spectrum. So, it was indicated that the polymeric chains have been attached to the par-ticles surface via covalent bonds.', '3.2. Thermal analysis', 'Thermogravimetric analysis diagrams of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 5. Weight loss in 85 ◦C can be related to the release of physically absorbed water. In un-modified nanoparticles, the minor weight loss in elevated temperatures can be attributed to the loss of hydroxyl groups of the particle surface attached by covalent bonds. Weight loss in modified nanoparticles could be a result of thermal degradation of the polymeric chains grafted to the surface of the nanoparti-cles. Also, the weight loss in 230–300 ◦C was due to the thermal decomposition of the sulfonate groups in the grafted PSV chains [30].

The remaining weight percentage in 850 ◦C is related to the modified TiO2 that is less than the added amount of PVI-modified TiO2 nanoparticles when the membrane was prepared. This decrease in weight in comparison with the theoretical amount could be related due to the degradation of the chains grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. Also, in order to obtain the par-ticular weight of the modified nanoparticles, specific amounts of modified and un-modified nanoparticles were weighed after and before complete burning out all the polymers. They were heated to temperatures about 1000 ◦C for 30 min and the obtained nanoparti-cles were weighed immediately.

The obtained results and theoretical amounts are shown in Table 1. The amounts of the obtained results in all cases are more than theoretical values. This could be related to the presence of free water molecules and hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticles surface in which their values are not subtracted from theoretical values. The diagrams of thermogravimetric analysis of both PPBI and nanocomposites prepared from the modified nanoparticles (10% w/w) are shown in Fig. 7. The weight loss observed in the tempera-ture range of 50–140 ◦C is a result of the release of water adsorbed into the membranes which is less significant in nanocomposites in comparison to pure membrane. The second loss in weight, observed at the temperature range of 500–530 ◦C, is also attributed to the thermal degradation of poly-meric backbone of the nanocomposite membranes which is almost identical to the degradation temperature of pure PPBI. As a result, the addition of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles do not have any noticeable effect on thermal stability of the prepared nanocomposites. As it is observed in Fig. 7, the degradation of PVI-modified nanoparticles occurs at 185 ◦C which is lower than the related tem-perature of PSV-modified ones.

Water uptake and doping level', 'Water uptake amount of nanocomposite membranes contain-ing 5, 10 and 15% of modified nanoparticles at 25 ◦C are shown in Fig. 8. Addition of silica nanoparticles to PPBI membranes increased their water uptakes due to the hygroscopic nature of SiO2 and TiO2nanoparticles. The sulfonic and imidazole groups in the nanopar-ticles increased the water uptake to a greater extent. The amount of water uptake for PPBI/TiO2-PSV, PPBI/SiO2-PSV, PPBI/TiO2-PVI and PPBI/SiO2-PVI are 21.6, 22.7, 20.4 and 21.9%, respectively. The effect of sulfonic acid groups of PSV chains grafted onto the nanoparticle surface on the water uptake is more than imidazole groups in PVI chains due to the higher hygroscopic properties of PSV comparing to PVI chains grafted on to the silica nanopar-ticle surface. The water uptake of PPBI/SiO2-PSV is higher than PPBI/TiO2-PSV which can be due to the further increase of the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles in comparison to TiO2 nanoparticle surface. The PPBI-based membranes were doped with 85% H3PO4 to prepare the acid-doped membranes. Fig. 9 shows the acid-doping levels of the PPBI-based nanocomposite membranes.

Among the prepared nanocomposites, the water uptake in PPBI/SiO2-PSV and acid doping in PPBI/SiO2-PVI were the most one. Even in the comparison of these membranes with the simi-lar ones which prepared from modified TiO2 such as PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, the amount of water uptake and doping level were higher.

On the other hand, comparing the pristine PPBI and Nafion®', '117 membranes, the relatively high proton conductivities of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles are noteworthy [32]. Li et al. have used sulfonated organosilica to modify Nafion® membranes and they found that the proton con-ductivities of the modified membranes were still lower than that of the neat Nafion® membrane. The reduction in the proton conductivity was attributed to the silica-induced changes in the tortuous paths and in the dis-tribution of hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains. However, in this work an enhancing effect on the proton conductivity was observed with addition of PSV and PVI grafted nanoparticles to PPBI mem-brane. The sulfonic and imidazole groups of modified nanoparticles also contribute in the acid-doping effect to PPBI polymer so as to enhance the proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles. Moreover, the presence of modified nanoparticles induces proton conductive pathways lead-ing to an increase in the proton conductivities of PPBI/modified nanoparticles membranes [24]. The proton conductivities of the acid-doped nanocompos-ite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 12) were further', 'Fig. 12. Proton conductivities of PPBI based nanocomposite membranes containing SiO2 (a) and TiO2 (b) nanoparticles at dry environment up to 145 ◦C.', 'studied at high temperatures under an anhydrous environment. All the PPBI/modified nanoparticle membranes still exhibited higher proton conductivities than the pristine acid-doped PPBI membrane. Generally, two principle mechanisms of vehicle mechanism and Grotthuss mechanism (hopping) describe proton diffusion through the membrane [33]. It is possible that the bounded water par-ticipates by the Grotthuss mechanism, and the free water takes part mostly by vehicle mechanism [34]. Addition of silica-SO3H to the membranes increases the bounded water content in the membranes (Fig. 13). The bounded water facilitates the proton transport ability through the Grotthuss mechanism, originating by generation of a continuous proton conductive pathway. There-fore, the high proton conductivity of PPBI/modified nanoparticles can be attributed to the high bounded water content in the membrane. Since the Grotthuss-type diffusion mechanism without assis-tance of the vehicle mechanism has been proposed for the protonconductionunderanhydrousenvironments[35,36], theprotonconductivityoftheacid-dopedPPBI/modified nanoparticlemembranescouldbesynergisticallyresulted from their modified nanoparticle contents and the acid-doping levels.

Proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PSV-modified nanoparticles shows significant increase in comparison to PVI-modified ones in low temperature and high rel-ative humidity. But in high temperature and low relative humidity, proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PVI-modified nanoparticles is observed to be more than PSV-modified ones and even at 145 ◦C the proton conductivity of PPBI/SiO2-PVI 15% is more than PPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%. The exis-tence of modified nanoparticles in PPBI nanocomposite membranes results in high proton conductivity in three ways:', '1) With increase in water uptake 2) With increase in the amount of doping level and 3) With increase in the number of proton conductive functional groups such as sulfonic acid group.', 'In PSV-modified nanocomposite membranes, acid doping decreases while the water uptake and the number of sulfonic acid groups shows an increase. Consequently, high proton conductiv-ity can be a result of these changes. It should be mentioned that in temperatures higher than 100 ◦C and in very low relative humidity, water uptake of PSV-modified membranes decreases which leads to low efficiency of the sulfonic groups attached onto the surface of the nanoparticles which in turn results in a decrease in proton conduc-tivity in both membranes, but the increase in proton conductivity resulting from high doping level is significant and also the proton conductivity of PVI-modified nanocomposite membranes increase in high temperatures.

Introduction of modified and un-modified nanoparticles increases the brittleness of the nanocomposite mem-branes with a decrease in their elongations at break. The effects of modified and unmodified nanoparticles on the elongations at break of the nanocomposite membranes were different. The decrease in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness were widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inorganic reinforcement [37–39].

Comparing the brittleness of the nanocomposite membranes of the PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/SiO2-PVI with PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, respectively indicates that the brittleness of the membranes prepared with modified SiO2 nanoparticles is less than the modified TiO2 ones.', '3.6.

In comparison, organic semiconductors can be made using more energy-efficient and cost-effective methods at near ambient conditions, such as roll-to-roll solution printing – a bottom-up processing method by which newspapers are manufactured. Such a solution also enables large-area deposition on plastic substrates and therefore \ue104exible electronic devices. One of the major challenges to achieving solution-processed organic semiconductors is the control of thin \ue103lm morphology during printing/coating processes, which critically in\ue104uences the device performance, o\ue09den by orders of magnitude. With the recent invention of numerous solution-processing methods emerged many elegant approaches for controlling thin-\ue103lm morphology, speci\ue103cally, the control of nucleation, crystal growth, in-plane and out-of-plane domain alignment, etc. In this review, we highlight these recent advancements in morphology control strategies in the context of solution-processed organic semiconductors, and their impact on the electronic properties of the resulting devices. It can be expected that the understanding and control of thin-\ue103lm morphology during solution processing will bring us closer to the future of energy-efficient production of low-cost, high-performance \ue104exible electronic devices.', '1.Introduction', 'Although many of the pioneering studies in the physics of organic semiconductors (OSCs) relied on vapor-grown crystals, there has been a signi\ue103cant interest recently in solution-based deposition techniques. While some of the highest charge carrier mobilities in OSCs have been observed in single crystals obtained by vapor-phase deposition, the performance of devices incorporating solution-grown OSC thin \ue103lms and single crystals have improved dramatically in the past few years. Even though new synthetic routes and design principles have been used to create novel semiconductor molecules, the improvements to device performance largely follow from the elucidation of the role of morphology and alignment in the charge transport efficiency of thin \ue103lms. Indeed, such knowl-edge has cast a light on the importance of a comprehensive', 'understanding of the physical principles underlying various processing mechanisms. An appreciation for fundamental studies along these lines can give us insight into how to control various aspects of these solution deposition techniques to achieve the desired performance of organic electronic devices. The goal of this review is twofold: (1) to survey and introduce a variety of solution-based deposition techniques commonly used in the industry and in research on organic electronics, and (2) to identify strategies used to tune the alignment and morphology of OSC thin \ue103lms. It is our hope that the methods described here can inspire both the application of these meth-odologies to other processing techniques and the development of new approaches for controlling these properties.', '2.Solution-based processing techniques', 'In this section, we will introduce and describe an array of pro-cessing methods that use organic semiconductor solutions.

In the case of dropcasting without a pinner, the solution droplet is free to move about the substrate, and the recession of the contact line is irregular, leading to unsteady, nonuniform deposition.8 At the beginning of solvent evaporation from the droplet, nucleation events occur all along the edge of the droplet and effectively guide the subsequent growth of (single-crystalline) ribbons and needles aligned in the direction of contact line recession.9,10', 'Because patterning is essentially dictated by the position of pinners, large-area deposition of aligned OSC crystals has been demonstrated using multiple pinners. There are also a few implementations of droplet pinning that involve the use of inclined substrates to induce alignment.11–13 So far, the pinning of inclined droplets have allowed for thin \ue103lms to be deposited, in contrast to the multiple crystals formed from droplet pinning on \ue104at substrates.', '2.2Spincoating', 'Spincoating is a commonly used solution method to form OSC thin \ue103lms of effectively uniform thickness. The solution is dropped onto a substrate, and the substrate is accelerated to a high angular velocity to simultaneously spread the liquid and evaporate the solvent. The thickness of the wet \ue103lm is inversely related to the spin speed and also depends on the solution concentration and viscosity. Spincoating is most o\ue09den used to deposit the active layer, but there has also been research look-ing into the simultaneous, one-step deposition of both the semiconductor and the dielectric layer needed for many device applications.14 The vertical phase segregation and self-assembly of OSC/insulator pairs led to improvements in morphology and device performance in several instances.15,16', 'Modi\ue103cations of conventional spincoating have been used to fabricate high performance devices. Yuan et al. used an “off-center” method whereby the target substrate was placed 20 to 40 mm away from the central rotation axis.17 The centrifugal force in this modi\ue103ed technique – unlike the case of on-center spin-coating, where solution is spread radially outward – facilitated unidirectional alignment of the resulting OSC thin \ue103lm. Because of the kinetic nature of the process and the rapid solvent evaporation and \ue103lm formation, a high performance, metastable molecular packing was achieved.', '2.3Meniscus-guided coating', 'Several solution coating techniques use the linear translation of either the substrate or the coating tool to induce aligned crys-tallite growth in the deposited thin \ue103lms. These methods involve the evolution of a solution meniscus, which acts as an air–liquid interface for solvent evaporation. The solution concentrates with the removal of solvent, and once the point of supersaturation is reached, the solute precipitates and is deposited as thin \ue103lm. In many of these techniques, alignment of the growing OSC thin \ue103lm is achieved by virtue of the inherent directionality of the linear motion guiding the solution. 2.3.1Dipcoating. Much like how it sounds, dipcoating involves the vertical withdrawal of a substrate dipped in a bath of OSC solution. Here, key parameters such as withdrawal velocity and substrate/solution temperature in\ue104uence the development of concentration gradients and \ue104uid \ue104ow within the meniscus. Depending on the solvent evaporation rate and the substrate speed, wet \ue103lms of varying thicknesses are achievable and can produce aligned crystalline domains in the dried \ue103lms. The free (liquid–air) and \ue103xed (liquid–solid) inter-faces are also relevant boundary conditions when considering the \ue104uid mechanics of these systems. Solvent choice is espe-cially important because of its effect on the rate of solvent', 'Fig. 1A schematic summary of the solution-based deposition techniques discussed.', 'This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014Energy Environ.

Binary azeotropic solvent mixtures, for example, have been exploited, yielding improvements to both the \ue103lm morphology and the performance of devices incorporating deposited OSC thin \ue103lms.18', "2.3.2Zone casting. The name of this technique is derived from the familiar zone re\ue103ning (or \ue104oating zone) process, which is commonly used to create high purity inorganic semi-conductor single crystals. Zone re\ue103ning was also shown to be possible for organic materials using a heating wire to melt pre-crystallized thin \ue103lms.19 Zone casting, in contrast, involves the deposition and evaporation of OSC solution, which \ue104ows through a nozzle that is passed over a (typically) temperature-controlled substrate. The solution is thus continuously fed to the solution droplet as it is dragged beneath the nozzle. 2.3.3Hollow-pen writing. Also known as “capillary pen printing,” this method makes use of the principles behind the common ink pen. Just as a normal pen deposits a solution of pigments onto paper, hollow pen writing instead uses OSC solutions that can be deposited and patterned on a desired substrate. Typical implementations of this method rely on motorized control to move the vertically mounted pen in all three directions. Normal, commercially available ink pens can be readily adapted for this process. 2.3.4Blading. There are a variety of so-called “blading” techniques including doctor blading, bar coating, and knife-over-edge methods, and the differences between them are o\ue09den vague. A solid substrate – a knife's edge, for example – is passed over a solution reservoir, leaving behind a uniform wet layer, a\ue09der which solvent evaporation is allowed to occur, aided or unaided. In some cases, this process is performed manually, although many are mechanically controlled. As its name suggests, bar coating uses a cylindrical bar that is either smooth20 or patterned with grooves or wrapped with wires.21,22 A key difference between these blading methods and other similar ones is that the entire solution reservoir is typically exposed to the ambient during coating. The coating speed is generally higher than in other techniques, up to of tens of cm s�1.23 As a facile way to simply spread a solution over a substrate, blading methods have been adapted to roll-to-roll processes24,25 and are amenable to the production of complex, multi-layered organic devices.26,27", 'Edge-casting is similar to other blading techniques in that a solution is simply coated over the substrate by the motion of solid surface above the droplet. Developed by Soeda et al., this method uses a \ue104at, rectangular edge of a coating blade and can produce single-crystalline thin \ue103lms by using slow solvent evaporation.28 A blade is moved at speeds on the order of tens of micrometers per second while sustaining a solution droplet in the gap between the rectangular blade and the substrate, which in ref. 28 was chosen to be 200 mm. The rectangular solution droplet was continuously fed with fresh solution so that the overall volume remained constant. High boiling point solvents (180 and 206 �C) were used with a moderate substrate temper-ature (80 �C) to deposit the \ue103lms. To our knowledge, this technique has not been applied to OSC systems other than the ones from the \ue103rst report, but the ability to form single crystals is quite attractive.', '2.3.5Slot-die coating. The use of slot dies for coating processes is o\ue09den associated with the extrusion of polymers and paint coatings. Very simply, an ori\ue103ce (the slot) permits the \ue104ow of material through a shaping device (the die) onto a moving substrate below. Slot-die coating is heavily used in industry and has been adapted to roll-to-roll processes.29 Curtain coating, for example, is a slot-die process where an uninterrupted stream of liquid material coats continuous substrate sheets, like photo-graphic \ue103lm, or discrete three-dimensional objects, like ice cream bars and doughnuts. The combination of slot-die schemes with roll-to-roll pro-cessing has mostly been applied to solar cells30,31 and light-emitting diodes32 so far. The processing parameters that affect the previously discussed methods like zone casting and dip-coating are applicable here as well. 2.3.6Solution shearing. Solution shearing is a highly versatile coating technique where a movable top shearing blade holds an OSC solution droplet above a temperature-controlled substrate.33,34 The blade is moved relative to the substrate at a \ue103xed speed, exposing the solution meniscus and allowing for solvent evaporation and the deposition of aligned thin \ue103lms. Compared to other blading techniques, the solution droplet is covered by the blade so that solvent evaporation is con\ue103ned to only the edges of the droplet. Because of the kinetic nature of the method, previously unobserved metastable molecular packing motifs – so-called “lattice-strained” crystal structures – were successfully formed using this method.35 The potential to tune molecular packing is valuable, given that altering the intermolecular p–p stacking distance between OSCs can dramatically enhance charge transport.36–38', 'A modi\ue103ed solution shearing technique developed by Diao et al. recently demonstrated the deposition of organic semi-conductor single crystals.39 Named “\ue104uid-enhanced crystal engineering”, or FLUENCE, the method introduced two features to rationally control solute nucleation and crystal growth during deposition: (1) a shearing blade patterned with pillars to induce mixing within the sheared solution droplet and (2) a selectively wetting substrate with specially designed shapes. In the latter, the coffee-ring effect40 was used to induce nucleation, a\ue09der which growing crystallites were \ue103ltered out so that only one could continue to grow. Mixing within the solution droplet served to reduce the mass transport limitations during crystallization.', '2.4Printing', 'The term “printing” is somewhat loosely de\ue103ned, and while some may use the word to refer to a very speci\ue103c type of depo-sition process, for the purposes of this review we categorize printing processes as those that are amenable to large-area deposition with spatial deposition control and that do not primarily rely on meniscus-driven coating. 2.4.1Brush painting. Much like hollow pen writing, brush painting draws inspiration from the common usage and applications of brushes to paint or coat solutions or suspen-sions of pigments. A typical brush is simply dipped into an OSC solution and brushed across the target substrate to coat the surface. In the deposition of polymer OSCs, it was found that', '2148 | Energy Environ.

The use of polymer stamps for the depo-sition of OSC thin \ue103lms has been studied and implemented in a variety of contexts. Stamps made of elastomeric poly(dimethyl-siloxane) (PDMS) and \ue104uoropolymers have been used to either facilitate solvent evaporation (through absorption into the stamp)43 or reduce it,44 respectively. Because polymer molds can be patterned during their fabrication, features can be designed, in turn, to pattern OSC thin \ue103lms. Sometimes referred to as a “lithographic” process, stamping spatially con\ue103nes OSC solu-tions under45,46 or between47 protrusions to simultaneously facilitate patterning and controlled solvent evaporation. In some reports, plastic pillar arrays were used,11 and patterned silicon molds have been shown to align conjugated polymers.48', '2.4.3Inkjet printing. Inkjet printing is a mature research area and has many commercial and scienti\ue103c applications. It involves the ejection of a jet of ink from a chamber via a piezoelectric or thermal process and the deposition of the so-formed droplet onto a desired substrate. Parameters such as ink viscosity, ink surface tension, and substrate surface energy are crucial for the effective ejection and deposition of droplets, and a delicate balance among processing parameters must be struck so that \ue104uid momentum transfer and droplet spreading are precisely controlled.49,50 A\ue09der contacting the substrate, droplets are then allowed to dry like in normal dropcasting methods. The printing of polymer solutions, for example, to form precisely patterned arrays is relatively complex, requiring an understanding of the \ue104uid \ue104ow involved.51 In many cases, inhomogeneities in the dried OSC \ue103lms arise from differential solvent evaporation or surface tension gradients in mixed solvent systems. Despite some of these complexities, precise control of these variables have allowed for the deposition of high-performing OSC \ue103lms.52–54', '2.4.4Spray coating. Similar to inkjet printing, spray coating deposition operates by ejection of solution droplets from a nozzle. However, in the latter, the small droplets are formed by aerosolization with an inert carrier gas to coat a substrate. For this method, the spray nozzle shape and size, the atomizing gas pressure, and key solution properties like surface tension and viscosity are highly relevant processing parameters in addition to typical ones like temperature and concentra-tion.55 Solution droplets typically hit the substrate and dry rapidly, or in some cases, they form very thin, contiguous wet \ue103lms. Spray coating setups can be controlled either manually or digitally with motorized manipulators. Standard spray coating methods have been used to fabricate organic solar cells56 and photodiodes, among others.57', 'Several variations of the basic spray coating technique have been used for organic electronics applications. For example, multiple spray nozzles have been used in sequence to deposit different OSCs in a layer-by-layer fashion.58 Bulk heterojunction', 'organic solar cells59 and LEDs60 have been fabricated using an evaporative spray technique, whereby very dilute solutions are \ue103rst aerosolized into a heated chamber and then funnelled through a nozzle into a second chamber containing the target substrate.61 Ultrasonic spray nozzles have been used to atomize solutions to droplets on the scale of micrometers, as well as to prevent solution clogging within the nozzle.62–64 Lastly, electro-spray deposition, where electricity is used to atomize the solu-tion, was shown to effective for the selective deposition of organic materials on metal surfaces.65', '3.Morphology control strategies for solution processing', 'As summarized in the previous section, recent years have wit-nessed rapid progress in the development of solution process-ing methods towards achieving the vision of low-cost, high-throughput, large-area fabrication of organic electronics. A key challenge in the area of solution-processed organic electronics lies in the precise control of thin \ue103lm morphology during solution deposition. The critical role of thin \ue103lm morphology in charge transport has been detailed in recent reviews.66–70', 'There has been a long-held perception that most OSCs, when solution deposited, exhibit lower charge carrier mobilities than their vapor-deposited single crystal forms. In the last few years, such a perception has been frequently challenged by the rapid developmentinmorphologycontrolmethodsduring solutionprocessing,suchasinthecaseof6,13-bis-(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene (TIPS-pentacene)71–73 and dioctylbenzothienobenzothiophene (C8-BTBT).17,53 Thanks to the unique characteristics of solution processing methods, new avenues have been explored for controlling thin \ue103lm morphology that are not easily implemented during vapor deposition, if at all possible. These new strategies include, but are not limited to, controlling the \ue104uid \ue104ow,72,74 tuning the solvent composition by addition of an antisolvent or soluble additives,2,53,75 controlling evaporation rate using asymmetric patterns,7,53 contact line engineering,72 alignment control via meniscus guide,46,76 etc. These recently developed morphology control strategies will be discussed in the following sections, which pertains to solution-processed organic \ue103eld-effect transistors. The discussion will focus on three aspects: control of nucleation, crystal growth, and domain alignment, with special emphasis on methods that exploit the unique characteristics of solution processing.', '3.1Control of nucleation', 'Crystallization of OSCs is composed of two steps, nucleation and crystal growth. Nucleation involves overcoming of a free energy barrier and is intrinsically stochastic.77,78 Such properties o\ue09den lead to random distribution of domain boundaries and domain sizes. This issue is not unique to solution processing and is also observed during vapor deposition. It is particularly important to control nucleation for the fabrication of single crystal arrays. Thus far, there have been relatively few methods reported on the control of OSC nucleation from solution, as summarized below.', 'This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2014Energy Environ.

The key to controlling nucleation lies with the control over solvent evaporation, which provides the driving force for nucleation during the coating process. One effective approach is to use asymmetric surface patterns to de\ue103ne asymmetric solution volumes. The region with lower solution volume serves as the nucleation control region due to faster solvent evaporation, and therefore faster rate of supersaturation generation. Recently, Goto et al.7', 'reported large single crystal arrays formed by inducing nucle-ation at patterned, small solution volume regions where solvent evaporation was faster (Fig. 2a–d). The faster solvent evapora-tion rate in the nucleation control region was veri\ue103ed using', 'computational \ue104uid dynamics simulations. Using this method combined with controlling the solvent vapor pressure during growth, the authors fabricated single-crystal arrays of 3,9-bis(4-ethylphenyl)-peri-xanthenoxanthene (C2Ph-PXX). In addition, the authors demonstrated that preferred crystal orientation could be partially induced by narrowing the width of the nucleation control region from 10 mm to 5 mm. Minemawari et al.53 developed a method for controlling nucleation during double-shot ink-jet printing of C8-BTBT single crystals. In this method, asymmetric patterns were also employed to induce nucleation where the solution volume was lower (Fig. 2e and f). When such patterns were employed, the crystal morphology was drastically improved, with a single-crystal yield of approximately 50%.Incomparison,onlypolycrystallinepatternswere obtained using simply rectangular shaped patterns of various aspect ratios, wherein nucleation primarily occurred from the edges. 3.1.2Contact line curvature. Another approach to control solvent evaporation is tuning of the contact line curvature. Inspired by the mechanism behind the coffee ring effect,40 we recently introduced a new strategy for controlling nucleation using this method using solution shearing as the platform, whereby nucleation is anchored at spots where the curvature of the contact line is the highest (Fig. 3). In this method, the shape of the contact line was modulated by patterning the substrate with solvent-wetting and dewetting regions. The initial parts of the wetting regions are shaped as triangles. As the meniscus passes, the contact line is temporarily pinned at the boundary of the triangles, until nucleation occurs at the sharp tips. The triangular design is also bene\ue103cial in that it de\ue103nes a wedge shaped meniscus that funnels the convective supply of solute towards the tip, which facilitates nucleation anchoring by lowering the nucleation induction time. In addition, the trian-gles are designed to be asymmetric to eliminate twin boundary formation. Following the triangles is a series of very narrow neck regions in the pattern whose purpose is to arrest the growth of undesired crystallites, which are otherwise difficult to', 'Fig. 2Nucleation controlled by solution volume asymmetry.

When combined with crystal growth control, this method enabled high probability of single-crystalline domains (>90% with 200 mm wide patterns, Fig. 3c) for the OSCs tested (TIPS-pentacene and 4T-TMS). This method is expected to be applicable to other deposition processes other than solution shearing, given the generality of curvature-modulated solvent evaporation. One drawback of this method is the relatively long ‘runway’ before the single-crystal growth ‘takes off’, which may limit the its use in \ue103ne-detail patterning. 3.1.3Nucleation-inducing agents. In addition to tuning the solvent evaporation rate by designing substrate patterns, nucleation can also be controlled using soluble additives. Such approach has been utilized to enable systematic studies of the impact of domain sizes on charge transport in solvent–vapor annealed TES-ADT thin \ue103lms.2 The understanding of how additives impact nucleation also has implications on dopant design,79 whereby dopant molecules come into play as soluble additives during \ue103lm morphology evolution.73 However, the role of dopant on morphology of solution-processed OTFT remains to be further explored. Recently, two inert additives (DMDBS, BTA; Fig. 4a), origi-nally designed for melt solidi\ue103cation of isotactic polypropylene (i-PP), were shown to effectively induce nucleation of a diverse set of OSCs by Stingelin, Chabinyc and coworkers.75 These two', 'electrically insulating compounds initially dissolve at the molecular level in the molten polymer or solution, and, on cooling or solvent removal, form well-dispersed, nanoscopic surfaces for heterogeneous nucleation of the host material. The authors found that the presence of the additive DMDBS in polymer P3DDT led to an increase of up to 50% in carrier yield compared with the neat polymer (Fig. 4a), which is attributed to the creation of a larger interfacial area between crystalline and amorphous domains through heterogeneous nucleation. A minute amount of DMDBS also reduced the domain sizes of annealed PCBM without adversely affecting the electron mobility. This effect was further explored as a patterning method by controlled deposition of the additive. With the nucleation agents, the authors also improved the device yield of bottom-contact TIPS-pentacene devices fabri-cated via ink-jet printing. The dielectric surface was function-alizedwithoctadecyltrichlorosilane,aself-assembled monolayer shown extensively to improve charge transport in vapor deposited active layers.80 However, its low surface energy leads to dewetting of most organic solvents. Upon addition of DMDBS, the area coverage of TIPS-pentacene \ue103lm greatly improved (Fig. 4c), whereas without the nucleation agent, the crystallization preferentially occurred on the Au electrodes. The yield of bottom contact transistor devices was therefore increased upon addition of the nucleating agent DMDBS. The hole mobility of the transistors was on the order of 10�2 cm2 V�1', 's�1. These examples show that enhanced nucleation using additives can greatly improve the device area coverage and can potentially enable device patterning by placing additives at pre-de\ue103ned locations on the substrate. However, the addition of nucleation-inducing agents inevitably leads to reduction in domain sizes, which is o\ue09den undesirable for transistor appli-cations due to lowered charge carrier mobilities in cases where domain boundaries are rate-limiting – especially in the case of high-angle domain boundaries.81 Nonetheless, the reduction in domain size may prove bene\ue103cial to organic photovoltaic applications in some cases. Other methods towards achieving nucleation control in vapor deposition or melt processing methods include the use of patternedroughsurfaces,82,83the useofchevron-shaped patterns for controlling silicon nucleation from its melt during laser annealing,84 etc. Nonetheless, there is a very limited number of approaches developed for controlling nucleation of OSCs, largely due to the challenge of attempting to control an intrinsically stochastic process.', '3.2Control of crystal growth', 'Crystal growth control impacts the level of crystallinity/struc-tural perfection, domain size distributions, substrate coverage, OSC-dielectric interface quality, etc., all of which are key to controlling the charge carrier mobility.

Crystal growth defects are commonly observed during rapid solution coating.85,86 Mass transport limitations during the coating process o\ue09den leads to', 'void formation and dendritic growth, both of which hinder efficient charge transport due to charge carrier trapping at the prevalent grain boundaries. To address this issue, we developed a technique that involves patterning of the coating blade with micropillars to enhance mass transport by re-directing the \ue104uid \ue104ow (Fig. 6).72 With the insight from \ue104uid dynamics simula-tions, we designed the following patterns. The pillar spacing (period) is sub-100 microns to match the typical domain size in the reference \ue103lm prepared without using micropillars. The cross-section of the micropillars is crescent-shaped, arching against the \ue104ow direction to encourage \ue104ow separation from the surface of the micropillars. This design is intended to generate recirculation behind the pillars. The narrow pillar spacing is designed to induce rapid \ue104ow expansion following acceleration through the gap, so as to facilitate mass transport in direction transverse to the coating direction where diffusive mass trans-port dominates. This method was implemented on the solution shearing platform. The use of micropillar-patterned shearing blades signi\ue103cantly improved the thin-\ue103lm morphology of TIPS-pentacene and 4T-TMS. The TIPS-pentacene domain size increased from micron-sized to as large as millimeter-sized, and the dendritic growth was eliminated in both cases.

In addition to directing the \ue104uid \ue104ow using structured printing blades, another elegant approach has been developed by Cho and coworkers wherein Marangoni \ue104ow was induced using mixed solvents to overcome the coffee ring effect frequently observed during inkjet printing.74 Marangoni \ue104ow is a type of \ue104ow caused by a surface tension gradient, and the', 'Fig. 7Crystal growth controlled by inducing Maragoni flow.

The convective \ue104ow that transports the solute to the contact line can be counterbalanced or enhanced, depending on the direction of the Marangoni \ue104ow. When adding a co-solvent of higher boiling point and lower surface tension, a Marangoni \ue104ow with a direction opposite that of the convective \ue104ow can be induced. On the other hand, the Marangoni \ue104ow can also enhance the convective \ue104ow if a low boiling point solvent with high surface tension is added as the minor component. Based on this strategy, the evaporation-induced \ue104ow in droplets can be controlled by varying the composition of the solvent mixture. The authors demonstrated this concept during ink-jet printing of TIPS-pentacene using chlorobenzene as a major solvent. When adding 25 vol% hexane (with lower boiling point and lower surface tension than the major solvent) as a minor solvent, the coffee-ring effect was found enhanced due to increased outward convective \ue104ow. When adding 25 vol% dodecane (with higher boiling point and lower surface tension', 'than the major solvent), the coffee-ring effect was signi\ue103cantly reduced instead, thanks to the inward Marangoni \ue104ow (Fig. 7). Using this approach, both the \ue103lm uniformity and the out-of-planealignmentweremarkedlyimproved,resultingin improved charge carrier mobility from 1.18 �10�3 (hexane) to 0.12 cm2 V�1 s�1 (dodecane). Although currently only demon-strated with ink-jet printing, this approach may be educational to other printing methods for alleviating meniscus pinning, which causes uneven \ue103lm morphology at times. 3.2.3Solvent vapor annealing. The solvent vapor annealing method, \ue103rst applied to organic semiconductors by Bulovi´c and coworkers for growing tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminum (Alq3) crystals,87 is a simple yet powerful post-processing technique for drastically improving \ue103lm morphology and even for obtaining single crystals following vapor deposition or spin coating. Using this method, spin-coated amorphous \ue103lms of triethylsilyle-thynyl anthradithiophene (TES-ADT) was transformed into polycrystalline \ue103lms with domain sizes of several hundred microns.88 As a result, the hole mobility in bottom contact bottom gate devices increased by two orders of magnitude to 0.1 cm2 V�1 s�1. Solvent selection was found to be critical in this method, which in\ue104uences both the partitioning of solvent molecules in the active layer and the proper substrate wetting during vapor annealing.88 In addition, substrates were also found to play an important role in controlling crystal growth.89,90', 'Crystal size and morphology of C8-BTBT was improved when the \ue103lm was solvent vapor annealed on poly(methyl methacry-late) (PMMA) substrate, but not on SiO2 substrates.90 When the vertically phase-separated \ue103lm of C8-BTBT/PMMA was prepared in one step during spin coating, subsequent vapor annealing yielded even larger C8-BTBT single crystals, and correspond-ingly, the hole mobility measured in top contact and bottom gate geometry reached as high as 9 cm2 V�1 s�1. However, the alignment of C8-BTBT single crystals remains random in this method, yielding a wide distribution of charge carrier mobil-ities. Recently, Loo and coworkers have elegantly shown that by tuning the surface energy of the substrates, crystal growth in as-spun TES-ADT \ue103lms during vapor annealing can be directed along pre-speci\ue103ed paths over arbitrarily large areas, therefore controlling the grain orientation and achieving patterning during solvent vapor annealing.89 To shed light on the solvent vapor annealing process, in-situ techniques based on quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction have recently been developed to monitor both solvent mass uptake and changes in the mechanical rigidity of the \ue103lm during solvent vapor annealing of spin-cast \ue103lms of TIPS-Pentacene.91 Through this study, the important role of solvent vapor pressure on the \ue103nal \ue103lm morphology and device performance was elucidated.

Within a single-crystalline domain, the mobility anisotropy is frequently on the order of 1– 10.102–105 Across a polycrystalline \ue103lm, the mobility anisotropy can range from a few times to several orders of magnitude depending on the nature of grain boundaries.81,86,93,106 Such sensitivity of charge transport to in-plane crystal orientation highlights the importance of controlling domain alignment. Over the past decade, many techniques have been developed to achieve in-plane alignment.68,70 This review will mainly focus on alignment methods newly developed within the past \ue103ve years, which took advantage of the unique characteristics of solution processing, such as molecular assembly in a moving meniscus and under a \ue104ow \ue103eld. 3.3.1Alignment using meniscus guide. The meniscus, in particular the solution–substrate–vapor triple phase contact line, is where a dynamic molecular assembly process takes place in the majority of the solution processing methods (when \ue103lm deposition occurs in the evaporation regime107). By guiding the meniscus in a particular direction, alignment of crystalline domains has been achieved using a variety of methods (Fig. 8 and 9). As diverse as these methods may appear, the mechanisms of achieving \ue103lm alignment are similar in that the direction of the convective \ue104ow towards the meniscus front is guided using static or moving surfaces. The underlying force directing the meniscus motion can be attributed to the capillary force.', 'Fig. 8 highlights two methods in which static meniscus guides were employed during solvent evaporation: drop-pinned crystallization76 and edge casting.46 In the \ue103rst method, the OSC solution droplet is pinned using a small piece of silicon wafer. The authors also pointed out another important requirement for achieving alignment: high nuclei density (i.e., high solution concentration). Using this method, the authors have fabricated a variety of organic thin \ue103lm transistors and inverters and demonstrated high charge carrier mobilities, enabled by improved alignment and crystal–dielectric interface.10,76 Partic-ularly, aligned C60 single-crystal arrays prepared using this method yielded unprecedented electron mobilities as high as 11 cm2 V�1 s�1. In the method of edge casting, the meniscus is guided using inclined surfaces that cover the solution droplet during solvent evaporation (Fig. 8b). Using this method, the authors demonstrated aligned crystal arrays of 2,9-alkyl-dinaphtho[2,3-b:20,30-f]thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (C10-DNTT) with highest hole mobility exceeding 10 cm2 V�1 s�1. Both methods offeradditionaladvantagesbesidesalignment,suchas patterned deposition over large area and the ability to handle low solubility organic semiconductors.

One major advantage of moving meniscus guides as compared to static ones lies with the wide tunability of coating/printing speeds, which offers accessibility to a range of morphology features, from aligned polycrystalline thin \ue103lms to spherulite forma-tion.71,100,108 It also offers accessibility to nonequilibrium molecular packing, which was proved bene\ue103cial to enhancing charge carrier mobilities in the case of TIPS-pentacene.71,72 In fact, roll-to-roll printing methods frequently employ moving meniscus guides as well,25,31 and in those cases the fundamental molecular assembly processes are similar to those in the methods mentioned above. 3.3.2Alignment using non-contact forces. In addition to using static or moving meniscus guide, \ue103lm alignment has also been achieved using non-contact, built-in forces speci\ue103c to each solution processing method. These forces include gravitational forceduringdip-coating85,106anddropcastingontilted substrates,109,110 drag force exerted by gas \ue104ow during drop-casting,6 etc. Use of other external forces not unique to solution processing is covered elsewhere.70', 'Recently, Bao, Huang, and coworkers described the growth of highly aligned C8-BTBT from a blended solution of C8-BTBT and polystyrene using an off-center spin-coating method.17 In this method, the \ue103lm alignment was achieved by guiding the meniscus motion using centrifugal force by placing the substrate in an off-center position (Fig. 10). The resulting C8-BTBT \ue103lm was highly aligned and exhibited a metastable crystal packing.Thesemorphologicalfeaturescombinedwith improved dielectric interface attained via vertical phase sepa-ration led to an ultrahigh hole mobility up to 43 cm2 V�1 s�1 (25 cm2 V�1 s�1 on average), which is the highest value reported to date for all organic molecules. 3.3.3Post-formation alignment using \ue104ow \ue103elds. Another method to achieve alignment over a large area is to orient existing single crystals carried in the solution using \ue104ow \ue103eld.111–114 The crystals aligned in this fashion are o\ue09den highly anisotropic in their shape, such as in the form of microwires. For example, a \ue103ltration-and-transfer (FAT) method was devel-oped, which allows for efficient alignment of organic wires with controllable density over a large area (Fig. 11).115 Brie\ue104y, microwires synthesized by the non-solvent nucleation method are dispersed in a poor solvent such as methyl alcohol or ethyl alcohol. Microwires are aligned by \ue104uid \ue104ow through a mask in a modi\ue103ed, simple vacuum \ue103ltration setup. Individual single-crystalline PTCDI microwire-OFETs showed electron mobilities up to 1.4 cm2 V�1 s�1, among the highest solution-processed n-channel organic semiconducting wire devices at the time when this research was conducted, while high-density microwire-OFETs only exhibited mobilities around 0.14 cm2 V�1 s�1.115', 'Post-alignment using \ue104ow \ue103eld is a promising method that exploits the unique characteristics of solution processing.

Commonly used approaches for fabricating polymer-based micellar carriers utilize block copolymers, which assemble into nanosized aggregates in aqueous media and thus encap-sulate the hydrophobic drugs in their interior. Although the past years have seen remarkable advances in the synthesis of block copolymers, their synthesis is still not trivial. Instead of using a hydrophobic second block, we envisioned employing a host moiety to encapsulate the hydrophobic drug and increase hydrophobic interactions leading to micellar aggregates. For this purpose, beta-cyclodextrin (β-CD), a cyclic oligosaccharide composed of glucose units, emerges as a viable candidate. It is well established that β-CD is a valuable excipient for enhancing the solubility and bioavailability of hydrophobic drugs.11–14', 'Previous studies have demonstrated β-CD’s utility in enhan-cing curcumin’s solubility and stability, making it an ideal candidate for formulating curcumin-based therapeutics.14–21', 'However, most of these studies solubilize curcumin in mole-cular form. Thus, the size of the complex usually falls much below the domain of nanosize necessary for drug delivery with passive targeting mediated by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.22 Apart from using CDs in molecular form, a variety of macromolecular constructs with CDs have been reported,23–25 To date, the CD moiety has been conju-gated to the chain end,26,27 as side chain residues,28 or utilized as a core motif in star-like multiarm polymers.29 In most cases, the CD moiety is non-reversibly conjugated to the poly-meric scaffolds, and thus, the encapsulated guest molecule is releasedpredominantlybyreversiblehost–guest interactions.30,31 In this study, we aimed for conjugation with a disulfide-based reversible linkage so that the encapsulated hydrophobic guest molecule remains soluble upon release from the polymer-based aggregate. In recent years, it has been established that the incorpor-ation of redox-responsive linkage in the drug delivery platform further enhances the cytotoxicity in cancerous cells with increased levels of glutathione (GSH).32–39 Thus, we targeted constructing a hydrophilic polymer containing a chain end β-CD unit linked with a redox-responsive linker. To obtain such a polymer in a modular fashion, we envisioned that a thiol–disulfide exchange using a benzothiazole disulfide (BDS) chain-terminated polymer could be utilized. The BDS group is known to undergo the thiol–disulfide exchange reaction with high efficiency, and we recently employed it for the functionali-zation of side chain residues of polymers, polymer-coated sur-faces and hydrogels.40–44 Until now, the usage of the BDS group as a thiol-reactive group on a polymer chain end has remained unexplored. The present work demonstrates the ver-satility of polymers containing the BDS group as a chain end moiety, along with demonstrating their utilization for obtain-ing β-CD-terminated polymers. Herein, we aimed to fabricate curcumin-loaded micellar nanoparticles using a redox-responsive polymeric construct in', 'which the CD moiety is linked to the end of the polymer chain through a redox-responsive disulfide linkage (Scheme 1). We employed a BDS-based linker at the chain end of a PEG-based hydrophilic polymer to obtain such constructs in a modular fashion. We report here the synthesis and functionalization of BDS group terminated polymers and show that the CD moiety could be efficiently added to the polymer chain end through a redox-responsive disulfide linkage. Thus the obtained β-CD-containing polymers are used to fabricate drug-loaded aggre-gates upon complexation with curcumin. It is also demon-strated that peptide-based cell targeting groups can be incor-porated at the other chain end of the β-CD-containing polymer. Drug loading and release studies, as well as cyto-toxicity and cellular internalization studies, suggest these poly-mers as promising candidates for the delivery of curcumin. Although the study here is undertaken with curcumin, one could expect that the modular approach reported here could be adapted for the delivery of other hydrophobic drugs to can-cerous cells in a targeted fashion.', 'Experimental section', 'Materials', 'Poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMEMA, Mn = 300 gmol−1) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used after purification through activated aluminum oxide filtration.

Commonly used approaches for fabricating polymer-based micellar carriers utilize block copolymers, which assemble into nanosized aggregates in aqueous media and thus encap-sulate the hydrophobic drugs in their interior. Although the past years have seen remarkable advances in the synthesis of block copolymers, their synthesis is still not trivial. Instead of using a hydrophobic second block, we envisioned employing a host moiety to encapsulate the hydrophobic drug and increase hydrophobic interactions leading to micellar aggregates. For this purpose, beta-cyclodextrin (β-CD), a cyclic oligosaccharide composed of glucose units, emerges as a viable candidate. It is well established that β-CD is a valuable excipient for enhancing the solubility and bioavailability of hydrophobic drugs.11–14', 'Previous studies have demonstrated β-CD’s utility in enhan-cing curcumin’s solubility and stability, making it an ideal candidate for formulating curcumin-based therapeutics.14–21', 'However, most of these studies solubilize curcumin in mole-cular form. Thus, the size of the complex usually falls much below the domain of nanosize necessary for drug delivery with passive targeting mediated by the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.22 Apart from using CDs in molecular form, a variety of macromolecular constructs with CDs have been reported,23–25 To date, the CD moiety has been conju-gated to the chain end,26,27 as side chain residues,28 or utilized as a core motif in star-like multiarm polymers.29 In most cases, the CD moiety is non-reversibly conjugated to the poly-meric scaffolds, and thus, the encapsulated guest molecule is releasedpredominantlybyreversiblehost–guest interactions.30,31 In this study, we aimed for conjugation with a disulfide-based reversible linkage so that the encapsulated hydrophobic guest molecule remains soluble upon release from the polymer-based aggregate. In recent years, it has been established that the incorpor-ation of redox-responsive linkage in the drug delivery platform further enhances the cytotoxicity in cancerous cells with increased levels of glutathione (GSH).32–39 Thus, we targeted constructing a hydrophilic polymer containing a chain end β-CD unit linked with a redox-responsive linker. To obtain such a polymer in a modular fashion, we envisioned that a thiol–disulfide exchange using a benzothiazole disulfide (BDS) chain-terminated polymer could be utilized. The BDS group is known to undergo the thiol–disulfide exchange reaction with high efficiency, and we recently employed it for the functionali-zation of side chain residues of polymers, polymer-coated sur-faces and hydrogels.40–44 Until now, the usage of the BDS group as a thiol-reactive group on a polymer chain end has remained unexplored. The present work demonstrates the ver-satility of polymers containing the BDS group as a chain end moiety, along with demonstrating their utilization for obtain-ing β-CD-terminated polymers. Herein, we aimed to fabricate curcumin-loaded micellar nanoparticles using a redox-responsive polymeric construct in', 'which the CD moiety is linked to the end of the polymer chain through a redox-responsive disulfide linkage (Scheme 1). We employed a BDS-based linker at the chain end of a PEG-based hydrophilic polymer to obtain such constructs in a modular fashion. We report here the synthesis and functionalization of BDS group terminated polymers and show that the CD moiety could be efficiently added to the polymer chain end through a redox-responsive disulfide linkage. Thus the obtained β-CD-containing polymers are used to fabricate drug-loaded aggre-gates upon complexation with curcumin. It is also demon-strated that peptide-based cell targeting groups can be incor-porated at the other chain end of the β-CD-containing polymer. Drug loading and release studies, as well as cyto-toxicity and cellular internalization studies, suggest these poly-mers as promising candidates for the delivery of curcumin. Although the study here is undertaken with curcumin, one could expect that the modular approach reported here could be adapted for the delivery of other hydrophobic drugs to can-cerous cells in a targeted fashion.', 'Experimental section', 'Materials', 'Poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMEMA, Mn = 300 gmol−1) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used after purification through activated aluminum oxide filtration.

This monomer is typically produced as an isomeric mixture of 3- and 7-(prop-2-ynyl)oxepan-2-ones (3- and 7-isomers) containing 30% of the 3-isomer and it has been widely used in biomedical appli-cations of the respective (co)polymers.29–36', 'In cancer therapy, conventional low-molecular therapeutics exhibit unfavorable pharmacokinetics, suboptimal biodistribu-tion, short blood half-life and prominent off-target, resulting in severe side effects.

The half-life can be further improved by coating the nanoparticles with stealth polymers. Notably, poly(ethylene glycol) coatings are extensively used to prevent aggregation and opsonization with plasma proteins.37', 'Several types of boron-containing compounds are frequently considered for cancer treatment, such as boronic acids and boron clusters.38 Boronic acids (BAs) are inherently electron-deficient organoboron compounds due to a vacant p-orbital on the boron atom. In aqueous media, hydroxyl groups act as Lewis bases interconverting the sp2-hybridized form of BAs to a tetrahedral sp3 hydroxyboronate anion in a pH-dependent equilibrium. Although both forms bind to 1,2- and 1,3-diols, boronate esters formed by the latter are more hydrolytically stable.39 Despite being highly reactive, BAs show remarkable stability and a very low toxicology profile.40 Owing to these pro-perties, BAs are employed as stimuli-responsive groups, as tar-geting ligands, and as therapeutics. In BA-containing materials for drug delivery, not only pH but also reactive oxygen species (ROS) and diols such as sugars and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) can be used as release triggers.41–43', 'Boron clusters are polyhedral boron hydrides whose high boron content makes them suitable for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT).38 Upon irradiation with thermal neutrons, boron-10 atoms yield recoiling lithium-7 nuclei and alpha par-ticles which destroy biologically active molecules, such as DNA, RNA, and proteins. The short path of these particles (approxi-', 'mately one cell in diameter – 10–14 μm) and the weak hydrogen and nitrogen capture cross-section limit damage to normal tissue.44 Nevertheless, delivering boronated compounds to a tumor while avoiding significant uptake in normal tissues and adsorption to plasma proteins remains a challenge.45 A promis-ing strategy for overcoming these drawbacks is integrating boron clusters with polymeric delivery systems.38', 'Thus, we prepared several diblock copolymers mPEG-b-P(ε-CL-co-PgCL) bearing propargyl pendant groups. The sub-sequent modification of reactive triple bonds via a thiol–yne click reaction with 1-thioglycerol yielded copolymers bearing vicinal diols, which can reversibly bind to boronic acid deriva-tives. Additionally, we studied the kinetic profile of ε-CL/PgCL copolymerization and characterized the self-assembled nano-particles by static and dynamic light scattering. The formation of small, homogeneous spherical micelles was visualized using conventional (negatively stained samples) and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy.

At the beginning, we performed the pre-liminary screening to map the effect of the reaction time and irradiation intensity on the molar mass, its distribution and the DS of the resulting polymers. Minimal degradation and the highest functionalization were observed after 65 minutes at 9 mW cm−2, which were taken as standard conditions (Table 2). The adopted reaction conditions resulted in negligible degradation within the modification of diblock copolymers 1a and 1b2 (Table 1). Only a slight decrease of molar mass accompanied by mild broadening of its distribution was observed (Table 2), as shown in Fig. S1(A and B).† The only exception was sample 2c10, containing the longest hydro-phobic block, that showed twice lower molar mass with the increase of dispersity from 1.27 to 1.70 after UV exposure (C, Fig. S1†). This behavior is in line with the previously published data, describing that longer PCL chains are more inclinable to undergo UV degradation.46 However, all diblock copolymers modified with 1-thioglycerol (Table 2) exhibited the same degree of substitution as the starting copolymers (Table 1). Moreover, no double bonds were detected in the 1H NMR spectra (B, Fig. 1). This indicates that each alkyne functional group was reacted with two thiol species, generating a dithioether. These findings are in line with previous obser-vations, upon monitoring the concentration of functional groups by IR spectroscopy.47', 'Kinetics and modeling of the copolymerization of ε-CL and 7-(prop-2-ynyl)oxepan-2-one', 'Furthermore, we thoroughly separated both PgCl isomers (3/7-(prop-2-ynyl)oxepan-2-ones) and performed (co)polymerization kinetic experiments with unsubstituted ε-CL to reveal the mutual reactivity of these species. Having in mind that the syn-thesized PgCl contains only 30% of the 3-isomer,29 we mainly focused on the copolymerization of ε-CL with the 7-isomer, as the content of the 3-isomer is further decreased upon addition of ε-CL (3 eq. of ε-CL towards PgCL in our experiments) and does not have a vast impact on the resulting copolymer struc-', 'ture. Despite the FDA-approval of tin(II) ethylhexanoate,8 we decided to study the (co)polymerization kinetics via a metal-free reaction pathway, using the organocatalyst TBD under milder reaction conditions (30 °C), as ROP catalyzed by Sn (Oct)2 at 110 °C is highly energetically demanding. Lineardependency ofln([M0]/[Mt])(Fig.2)ontime showed that the propagation reaction of ε-CL and 7-isomer copolymerization is first order with respect to the monomer concentration, confirming the controlled character of copoly-merization (Fig. 2).

The reactivity ratio of both como-nomers was identified by 1H NMR analysis of the reaction mixtures that provided the total monomer conversion and the evolution of monomer feed composition within the copoly-merization reaction. This set of experimental data was pro-cessed with the Integrated Ideal Model (A, Fig. 3). The Integrated Ideal Model was developed by Frey et al.49 and it is derived from Wall’s non-terminal (“ideal”) model,50 describ-ing the ideal copolymerization (r1·r2 = 1). The calculated copolymerization parameters of the ε-CL and 7-isomer couple obtained from the Integrated Ideal Model (rε-CL = 0.36; r7-is = 2.79) confirmed the higher reactivity of the 7-isomer (A, Fig. 3). The same data set (total conversion vs. monomer feed com-position) was also evaluated with the more complex terminal model originally proposed by Mayo and Lewis.51 The differen-tial Mayo–Lewis equation was combined with the Skeist relation52 and converted to the integrated model by Meyer and Lowry.53 The Meyer–Lowry model (Fig. S3†) provided similar copolymerization parameters (rε-CL = 0.28; r7-is = 2.05) to the Integrated Ideal Model (rε-CL = 0.36; r7-is = 2.79, Fig. 3A) without a significant change in the fit quality. Overall, the Integrated Ideal Model can sufficiently describe the experi-mental data, which clearly indicates the ideal copolymeriza-tion of ε-CL with the 7-isomer. The similar copolymerization behavior has been already studied for different monomer systems.49,54,55', 'Copolymerization parameters obtained from the Integrated Ideal Model49 enabled the calculation and further precise display of structural composition along the polymer chain by applying the Skeist model (Table S2† and Fig. 3B).52 The result-ing gradient copolymer showed a lightly tapered composition profile with an increase of the ε-CL consumption at higher conversions where the more reactive 7-isomer is almost ener-vated (B, Fig. 3).

Then, the struc-ture I3 relaxes to its conformers I3r and I3r2. The free energy of the last transition state TS34 is comparable to that of the first transition state TS12. In toluene solution, the last tran-sition state TS34 is the highest one in energy on the whole reaction path. Thus, similarly to the 7-isomer,55 ε-CL may undergo several forward and reverse reactions between the initial state I1 and the intermediate state I3r2 before crossing the TS34 transition state. However, the energy difference between the first transition state TS12 and the highest tran-sition state on the whole reaction path is only ca. 0.3 kcal mol−1 for ε-CL (in toluene), while it is 1.1 kcal mol−1 for the 7-isomer. Thus, we expect that the reverse reaction and its impact on the polymerization rate are much less significant for ε-CL than for the 7-isomer which is in agreement with the homopolymerization kinetic study (left, Fig. 2). Note that for ε-CL under vacuum, TS12 is the highest transition state.

The exothermic reaction from the I4 state to the I5 state consists of straightening of the opened ε-CL ring after cleavage of the weak NH–O hydrogen bond. The free energy of the final state I5 is −1.5 kcal mol−1 under vacuum and 1.2 kcal mol−1 in toluene, respectively, with respect to the ground state. Thus, the entire reaction from I1 to I5 is exothermic with a reaction energy of −3 to −4 kcal mol−1. It should be pointed out that in a solution, the hydro-gen bond cleaved in the reaction I4 →I5 can be replaced by a hydrogen bond to surrounding molecules, which further decreases the reaction energy and disfavors the reverse reac-tion I5 →I1.

The only exception was sample 2a2; however, the second distribution is minor, as it is intensity weighted (C, Fig. 5). Their hydrodynamic radii were rather small (in agreement with the angle-independent scattering observed in SLS), increasing slightly with the length of the hydrophobic block (Table 4). The average nanoparticle density was deter-mined according to the following relationship: ρ = 3Mw/ (4πNARh3), where Mw stands for the molar mass of the nano-particles determined by SLS, Rh stands for the corresponding', 'hydrodynamic radius of the nanoparticles, and NA is the Avogadro number. The average densities of the nanoparticles were relatively low. Small hydrodynamic radii accompanied by low aggregation numbers indicate the formation of “fluffy” solvent-swollen nanoparticles. It can be concluded that 2a2, 2b2, and 2c10 formed small spherical micelles. In light scattering, particle size and shape are determined indirectly. Thus, we visualized the prepared nanoparticles for direct and unambiguous size and shape determination via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). We performed TEM using negative staining with uranyl acetate to improve the TEM contrast65 and we also performed cryo-TEM.

The value obtained from cryo-TEM is in a good agreement with the hydrodynamic radius determined by DLS (RH = 14 nm, Table 4), as it corresponds to the whole core–shell nanoparticle, while the PEG hydrophilic corona cannot be visualized by TEM techniques, as soft materials with low atomic numbers do not deflect electron beam sufficiently and exhibit poor scattering contrast.66,67', 'Encapsulation of the model drug', 'As the results of the self-assembly investigation were promising, we further studied the encapsulation of a novel redox probe, COSAN-pyridinium-3-boronic acid conjugate (CosBA). As high-lighted in the Introduction section, both boron clusters and boronic acids are highly relevant for cancer therapy. In the model drug, the high boron content of a boron cluster required for BNCT is combined with pH-responsive binding to 1,2- and 1,3-diols characteristic of boronic acids. Thus, together with the vicinal diol-containing polymeric DDS, significant uptake in normal tissues and adsorption to plasma proteins could be avoided while achieving microenvironment-triggered release. A solution of polymer 2a2, the redox probe CosBA and pyri-dine in dry acetonitrile-d3 was prepared and analyzed using 1H and DOSY NMR in order to investigate the CosBA binding to the diol-decorated polymer. Pyridine was added as a ligand that facilitates the formation of boronic acid ester.68 DOSY signals of the polymer and CosBA were integrated manually for each experiment and fitted with the exponential decay of signal intensities, demonstrating that CosBA is attached to polymer 2a2 (A, Fig. 7). Furthermore, we added glycerol (20 eq. with respect to CosBA) to the solution of the polymer and CosBA. Glycerol has a higher binding affinity towards CosBA in comparison with the diol-decorated polymer,41 resulting in CosBA release from the polymer, as visualized in Fig. 7B. This process was also monitored by 1H NMR (C, Fig. 7), showing the disappearance/ shift of the characteristic CosBA signal at 4.66 ppm when attached to the polymer (black and red curves, Fig. 7). The same signal was observed again after the addition of glycerol (blue curve, Fig. 7C). Finally, we studied how the encapsulation of CosBA affects the nanoparticle characteristics. We dissolved 2a2, 2b2, and 2c10 (1 eq.) and CosBA (0.7, 0.5 and 0.4 eq. per diol-modified ε-CL unit respectively) in THF and then proceeded according to the previously used protocol to prepare nanoparticle solu-tions (Experimental section). The THF/water solutions contain-ing CosBA were intensively yellow. During the dialysis, the dia-lysate remained colorless while the sample inside the dialysis membrane retained its yellow color. No precipitation occurred when the solvent was gradually changed from THF-rich to de-ionized water and for at least two weeks after the nanoparticle preparation. These observations visually confirmed the encap-sulation of CosBA into polymeric micelles as the small mole-', 'cules did not diffuse through the porous membrane or precipi-tate due to its limited solubility. The SLS and DLS experiments of the loaded nanoparticles are summarized in Table 4. Apparent distributions of hydro-dynamic radii at 130° were calculated from the corresponding autocorrelation functions (Fig. S4†). The dispersity of loaded nanoparticles is higher in compari-son with neat ones (C, Fig. 5 vs. Fig. S4†) and, interestingly, significantly decreases with nanoparticle size (Fig. S4†). We observed virtually no effect of drug loading on the smallest micelles (P2a2, Table 4); however, the asymmetric shape of the distribution curve indicates the presence of a particle fraction with larger hydrodynamic radii, unresolved by the applied fit (size ratio below 2 is beyond the resolution of DLS).62', 'Conversely, loading with CosBA significantly affects the other samples. Regarding P2b2 and P2c10, CosBA incorporation results in approximately 20% and 100% increase of hydrodyn-amic radii and the molecular weight with the corresponding aggregation number, respectively. The growth of the micelle does not compensate fully the increase in the number of chains; consequently, the micellar density also increases by approximately 50% (Table 4).', 'Conclusion', 'In conclusion, we prepared diblock copolymers mPEG-b-P(ε-CL-co-PgCL) bearing vicinal diols by the copolymerization of ε-CL with PgCL, followed by the transformation of alkyne moi-etiesviaathiol–yneclickreactionwith1-thioglycerol. Additionally, we studied the kinetic profile of the copolymeri-zation of ε-CL and 7-(prop-2-ynyl)-oxepan-2-one, showing the higher reactivity of the 7-isomer in this comonomer couple which was further verified by quantum chemical calculations. The synthesized amphiphilic diblock copolymers mPEG-b-P (ε-CL-co-PgCL) decorated with vicinal diols allowed the prepa-ration of self-assembled nanoparticles in water, which were characterized by static and dynamic light scattering. The for-mation of small, homogeneous spherical micelles was visual-ized by using conventional and cryogenic transmission elec-tron microscopy. Finally, we encapsulated a newly synthesized model drug, COSAN-pyridinium-3-boronic acid conjugate, into spherical micelles and investigated the effect of drug loading on these particles. The interplay between the model drug and our diblock copolymer was observed by DOSY NMR and light scat-tering methods. Ultimately, these findings will lead to the reproducible preparation of fine-tuned amphiphilic block copolymers capable of binding to boronic acid-based anti-cancer agents.', 'Author contributions', 'All authors wrote the manuscript and approved the final version of the manuscript.

A series of poly(N-isopropylmethacrylamide) (PNIPMAM) polymer, poly(N-isopropylmeth-acrylamide)-b-poly(acrylic acid) (PNIPMAM-b-PAA) diblock, and poly(acrylic acid)-b-poly(N-isopropylmethacrylamide)-b-poly(acrylic acid) (PAA-b-PNIPMAM-b-AA) triblock copolymer samples were synthesized via ATRP. A facile post-functionalization route was developed that uses an activated ester functionality to convert poly(N-methacryloxysuccinimide) (PMASI) blocks to LCST capable polyacrylamide, while poly(t-butyl acrylate) (PtBA) blocks were converted to water-soluble poly(acrylic acid) (PAA). The post-functionalization was monitored via 1H NMR and ATR-FTIR. The aqueous solution properties were explored and the PNIPMAM polymers were shown to have a LCST phase transition varying from 35 to 60 �C. The ability to synthesize block copolymers that are thermoresponsive and water-soluble will be of great benefit for broader applications in drug delivery, bioengineering, and nanotechnology.�2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction', 'Many polymers show a reversible phase transition in response to an increase in temperature, known as a lower critical solution temperature (LCST). This LCST transition has been studied for many polyacrylamides including poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) and poly(N-isopropylmethacrylamide) (PNIPMAM) [1,2]. Recently, there has been increasing interest in polymers exhibiting LCST properties for the design of ‘‘intelligent’’ or ‘‘smart’’ materials [3e17]. The thermoresponsive nature of these polymers has led to applications in drug delivery [13e 16], bioengineering [5,8,9,11], nanotechnology [6,7,10,12,17], and a promising future for applications in the areas of biosensors and membranes.', 'The LCST transition is driven by an increase in entropy upon heating, due to the loss of both the hydration of the hy-drophilic amide group and the hydrophobic interactions of the alkyl pendant group, where entropy of the pendant group out-weighs the enthalpic contribution [18]. Typically the cloud point of a dilute polymer solution is reported as an indicator of the polymer sample’s thermoresponsive nature, rather than the LCST minimum of a polymer/water phase diagram [19]. The cloud point (T50%) is defined as the temperature at which normalized transmittance is reduced to 50% during the phase transition. For polyacrylamides, the cloud point has been shown to be dependent on concentration [20e22], end group composition [19,23,24], and molecular weight (MW) [2,21,22,25e34]. The majority of these studies used conventionally polymerized samples without well-defined polymers of low polydispersity (PDI), which prevented precise examination of the LCST transition. These previous studies showed that the well-controlled synthesis of LCST polymers,', '* Corresponding author. E-mail address: tew@mail.pse.umass.edu (G.N.

The synthesis of polyacrylamides has been approached us-ing many techniques. The most commonly used polymeriza-tion method is controlled free radical polymerization (CFRP) includingatomtransferradicalpolymerization(ATRP)', '[18,19,23,35e39], reversible addition fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization [24,40e44], and nitroxide mediated polymerization (NMP) [45,46]. In most cases, these polymerization techniques prove to be difficult for acrylam-ides, yielding higher polydispersities, low MWs, or requiring special reaction conditions [18,19,35e46]. For the ATRP of polyacrylamides, control over polydispersity is difficult due to several reasons: deactivation of the copper catalyst due to complexation with the amide group, a cyclization reaction of the bromine end with the penultimate amide nitrogen, and an inadequate redox potential of the catalysts causing in-creased radical concentration and thus biradical termination. All of the above factors result in difficult to control polymer-izations for the ATRP of acrylamides and thus polydispersity index (PDI) values ranging from approximately 1.1 to 3 oc-curred [35,37e39]. Good control for the ATRP of PNIPAM homopolymers has been achieved, using more dynamic cata-lyst/initiator pairs and various polar solvents tuned specifically for the conditions [18,19,35]. This paper discusses the synthesis of PNIPMAM via a post-functionalization route. An activated ester, N-metha-cryloxysuccinimide (MASI), was polymerized via ATRP. MASI has been shown to polymerize in a controlled ‘‘living’’ fashion via ATRP and is able to initiate a second monomer [47]. MASI has been used previously by our group to synthe-size well-controlled block copolymers that can later be func-tionalized with various groups to achieve polymers with different properties [48,49]. Here, poly(N-methacryloxysucci-nimide) (PMASI) homopolymer and block copolymers were functionalized to create PNIPMAM samples with thermores-ponsive solution properties. The controlled synthesis of poly-mer and block copolymer samples of PNIPMAM with low polydispersity will be discussed in this paper.

PNIPMAM polymer synthesis', 'We reported previously the controlled homopolymerization of PMASI to MWs ranging from w8 to 15 kDa [49]. For this study, PNIPMAM was synthesized via a novel post-function-alization approach of the activated ester, MASI, as shown in Scheme 1. The known problematic controlled polymerization of amides was avoided using this approach [18,19,35e46]. ATRP was used to synthesize a series of PMASI homopoly-mers with controlled MWs and polydispersity (Table 1). The samplesofPMASIwerethenfunctionalizedtoform PNIPMAM through reaction of the activated ester functional group. The conversion of PMASI to PNIPMAM was analyzed us-ing 1H NMR and ATR-FTIR. In the 1H NMR (DMSO-d6) spectra of the homopolymer, the MASI group has a distinct broad singlet at 2.79 ppm. The complete disappearance of this peak was seen in the spectrum of PNIPMAM after reac-tion, along with the simultaneous appearance of the NeH am-ide singlet, the methyne singlet, and the methyl doublet from the isopropylamide functional group as shown in Fig. 1. These spectral changes are consistent with the conversion of MASI to isopropylamide. In addition, the ATR-FTIR spectrum of PMASI has three distinct bands (1808, 1778, 1732 cm�1) cor-responding to the MASI functional group [49]. After reaction with isopropylamine, the ATR-FTIR spectrum shows that the characteristic MASI bands have been replaced with bands at 1630 and 1529 cm�1, which are consistent with amide', 'functionality (Fig. 2). Therefore, the post-functionalization of PMASI to PNIPMAM was confirmed to be greater than 99% by 1H NMR and ATR-FTIR. Putnam and Wong recently published a report detailing side reactions associated with PMASI precursor polymers [50]. The report outlines amines reacting with MASI to form the de-sired amides as well as a ring-opened amide and glutarimide side products (see Scheme 2). Putnam shows the reduction of these side products with increasing temperature between 25, 50, and 75 �C, while changing time or concentration had little effect on side product yield. Here, PMASI was reacted with isopropylamine at 60 �C. The ring-opened amide side product was found to be present via 1H NMR, with peaks at 7.26 and 6.71 ppm corresponding to the two ring-opened am-ide protons, with a 1:1 ratio of integrated area (Fig. 1). The to-tal ring-opened amide ratio was determined to be 23 mol% in the polymer samples. Putnam and Wong do not report the amido ester peak (e00 in Fig. 1) in the ring-opened structure due to overlapping benzyl peaks in their NMR spectra. The ring-opened amide side product may also be visible in the FTIR spectrum which would be consistent with a ring-opened amide I stretch at 1708 cm�1 (Fig. 2). In addition, this IR sig-nal is weaker than the two other bands at 1529 and 1630 cm�1, consistent with the 1H NMR integration of w23 mol % ring-opened amide. Interestingly, careful examination of the 1H NMR spectrum shown in Fig. 1 does not show any evidence for the glutarimide side product. Specifically, Putnam and Wong reported a small downfield shoulder on the peak of the methylene adjacent to the amide nitrogen. The methylene shown in Fig. 1 at 3.79 ppm does not have a shoulder expected for the glutarimide. Neither of these side products have been observed by our group with the use of poly(N-succinimide p-vinylbenzoate) (PNSVB), a styrene based activated ester uti-lizing the same succinimide functionality [51].', '4.

Although control over MW and polydispersity was demon-strated with the ATRP of MASI monomer to form well-defined PMASI, then converted to PNIPMAM samples, higher conversion of larger MW PMASI targets was difficult to obtain. For the reaction of MASI with the molar ratio of [M]0:[I]0: [C]0 ¼ 350:1:1, a conversion of only 33% (Mn,GPC ¼ 13.0 kDa) was obtained after 1 h (Table 1). Using the same reaction ratios, longer reaction times (up to 48 h) yielded similar conversions with approximately the same MW, but typically accompanied by higher PDI (>1.3). Lowering the monomer to initiator ratio (from [M]0:[I]0:[C]0 ¼ 350:1:1 to [M]0:[I]0:[C]0 ¼ 175:1:1 and [M]0:[I]0:[C]0 ¼ 100:1:1) yielded similar results where a MW threshold of approximately 14 kDa was achieved, regardless of reaction time. We speculate that the threshold of MW is due', 'to aggregation of the polymer chains as they grow in size during polymerization [52]. The aggregation makes the chains less ac-cessible to available monomer in solution and polydispersity in-creases due to the aggregation of chains and side reactions from this concentrated aggregate, while free chains continue to prop-agate in solution. Further work is required to elucidate the exact cause of the observed MW limit; however, it is known that ani-sole is not a good solvent for PMASI. This MW threshold of PMASI corresponds to approximately 9 kDa for functionalized PNIPMAM polymer.

The ring-opened side product is apparent in all samples, making the role of the side product on changes in the cloud point difficult to elucidate. Further studies are needed with samples of varied side product composition to understand the influence of the side product on the cloud point. However, the apparent Mn of the polymers in solution is also affected by the polydispersity of the polymer. As shown in Fig. 6b, the cloud points decrease with increasing PDI. Due to the relatively low MW ranges of the PNIPMAM series studied here, a broader PDI gives rise to a larger contribution from higher MW polymer chains, thus the cloud point temperature is reduced. This effect of PDI on cloud point is exaggerated for low MW samples and is likely to greatly alter the Mn versus cloud point trend shown in Fig. 6a, for the relatively low Mn series. The cloud point values for the diblock and triblock copol-ymers were both lower than the cloud point values for the PNIPMAM polymers having similar PNIPMAM molecular', 'weight. Furthermore, the PNIPMAM blocks in the diblock and triblock copolymers have similar MW, yet the cloud point value of the triblock copolymer is much lower than the diblock copolymer cloud point (38.8 and 45.6 �C, respectively). Deter-mining the effect of PAA content in the block copolymers on the cloud point is difficult due to the many molecular param-eters that effect the LCST transition such as composition of the block copolymers and their structure. However, these re-sults suggest that PAA is responsible for making aggregation of the block copolymers more favorable, thus reducing the temperature of the cloud point transition. The cloud point of LCST polymer solutions has been reported to be pH sensitive as well [18,55,56]. All of the PNIPMAM polymer as well as diblock and triblock copolymer solution samples showed a cloud point transition upon going from a neutral solution (Milli-Q purified water pH ¼ 5.4) to an acidic solution with addition of HCl. This transition was re-versible and reproducible many times.

Conclusions', 'PNIPMAM and PNIPMAM block copolymers were synthe-sized using a post-functionalization approach with relatively narrow polydispersities. A series of PMASI homopolymers were synthesized and functionalized to PNIPMAM, although an upper MW limit was observed due to solubility. The aque-ous solution properties of the series were studied and the PNIPMAM polymers were shown to have an LCST phase transition through turbidity measurements. The cloud point transition of the PNIPMAM polymer series is shown to be weakly correlated to MW and has an inverse dependence on polydispersity. The correlation between cloud point and MW was difficult to determine due to the narrow and relatively low MW of the PNIPMAM polymer samples. The ability to synthesize well-defined block copolymers that are thermores-ponsive and water-soluble will be of benefit for future applica-tions in drug delivery, bioengineering, and nanotechnology. Although PMASI is shown here with a side reaction (ring-opened amide), our previous work and that from Putnam shows how to avoid these by-products. Also, we recently re-ported PNSVB which is a styrene based activated ester that showed no side products. These approaches will continue to make post-functionalization a reasonable method for complex architectures and monomers which are difficult to polymerize.', 'Acknowledgments', 'The authors thank the Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) and the Army Research Office for the Young Investigator Award and their generous support for this work.', 'References', '[1] Djokpe E, Vogt W.

And polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were prepared through radical polymerization of 1-vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface-vinylated nanoparticles. The polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were utilized as a functional additive to prepare PPBI/polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. Imida-zole and sulfonated vinylbenzene groups on the surface of modified nanoparticles forming linkages with PPBI chains, improved the compatibility between PPBI and nanoparticles, and enhanced the mechanical strength of the prepared nanocomposite membranes. The prepared nanocomposite membranes showed higher water uptake and acid doping levels comparing to PPBI. Also, after acid doping with phosphoric acid, nanocomposite membranes exhibited enhanced proton conductivity in comparison to the pristine PPBI and PPBI/un-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. The enhancement in proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes resulted from modified SiO2 nanoparticles showed higher conductivity than modified TiO2 nanoparticles. The above results indicated that the PPBI/modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for medium temperature fuel cells. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang-', '∗Corresponding author.

Sulfonated polysulfone (PSF) [4], polyetheretherketone (PEEK) [5,6] and polybenzimidazoles (PBIs) [7–11] are among poly-mers which can be used as alternatives for Nafion in PEFCs. Amongpolybenzimidazolederivatives,poly[2,2-5,5(m-phenylene)-bibenzimidazole](PBI),whichisalsocalled commercial polybenzimidazole have been used as a mem-brane material in PEMFCs. Having high chemical as well as thermal resistance and proton conductivity, polybenzimidazoles are great options to be used in the fuel cells with function at elevated temperatures above 100 ◦C [12]. PBIs should have enough proton conductivity so that it could be used as proton exchange membranes in the fuel cells. To achieve this purpose, they are usually doped with a sufficient acid like H3PO4 to an appropriate doping level [13]. Nanocomposite membranes are a new group of membranes which contain nanopar-ticles such as SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 and other compounds [14–21]. The introduction of nanoparticles into the membranes results in a considerable improvement in their features like mechani-cal properties, methanol permeability, but in some cases leads to a decrease in proton conductivity [22–24]. In order to over-come this problem, surface functionalized nanoparticles, which means various compounds with polar groups grafted chemically', '0378-7753/$ – see front matter © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

As men-tioned before, the numerous research works were done concerning grafting various compounds on the SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles which used for different purposes. However, in this work, we have used monomer bearing functional groups like imidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene which can improve the properties of pro-ton conductive membranes. These monomers are polymerized on the surface of the nanoparticles and as a consequence, they can more affect the properties of the membranes than while one functional group is grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles.

After filtration, the washing method used to wash the modified nanoparticles, was applied to the resulting powder as well. The FT-IR spectrum of the obtained powder did not show any absorbent bands related to PVI and PSV chains. The absorbent bands, which existed in the spectrum of mod-ified nanoparticles, were not observed in this spectrum.

Thermal analysis', 'Thermogravimetric analysis diagrams of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 5. Weight loss in 85 ◦C can be related to the release of physically absorbed water. In un-modified nanoparticles, the minor weight loss in elevated temperatures can be attributed to the loss of hydroxyl groups of the particle surface attached by covalent bonds. Weight loss in modified nanoparticles could be a result of thermal degradation of the polymeric chains grafted to the surface of the nanoparti-cles. Also, the weight loss in 230–300 ◦C was due to the thermal decomposition of the sulfonate groups in the grafted PSV chains [30].

They were heated to temperatures about 1000 ◦C for 30 min and the obtained nanoparti-cles were weighed immediately.

The obtained results and theoretical amounts are shown in Table 1. The amounts of the obtained results in all cases are more than theoretical values. This could be related to the presence of free water molecules and hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticles surface in which their values are not subtracted from theoretical values. The diagrams of thermogravimetric analysis of both PPBI and nanocomposites prepared from the modified nanoparticles (10% w/w) are shown in Fig. 7. The weight loss observed in the tempera-ture range of 50–140 ◦C is a result of the release of water adsorbed into the membranes which is less significant in nanocomposites in comparison to pure membrane. The second loss in weight, observed at the temperature range of 500–530 ◦C, is also attributed to the thermal degradation of poly-meric backbone of the nanocomposite membranes which is almost identical to the degradation temperature of pure PPBI. As a result, the addition of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles do not have any noticeable effect on thermal stability of the prepared nanocomposites. As it is observed in Fig. 7, the degradation of PVI-modified nanoparticles occurs at 185 ◦C which is lower than the related tem-perature of PSV-modified ones.

Addition of silica nanoparticles to PPBI membranes increased their water uptakes due to the hygroscopic nature of SiO2 and TiO2nanoparticles. The sulfonic and imidazole groups in the nanopar-ticles increased the water uptake to a greater extent. The amount of water uptake for PPBI/TiO2-PSV, PPBI/SiO2-PSV, PPBI/TiO2-PVI and PPBI/SiO2-PVI are 21.6, 22.7, 20.4 and 21.9%, respectively. The effect of sulfonic acid groups of PSV chains grafted onto the nanoparticle surface on the water uptake is more than imidazole groups in PVI chains due to the higher hygroscopic properties of PSV comparing to PVI chains grafted on to the silica nanopar-ticle surface. The water uptake of PPBI/SiO2-PSV is higher than PPBI/TiO2-PSV which can be due to the further increase of the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles in comparison to TiO2 nanoparticle surface.

On the other hand, comparing the pristine PPBI and Nafion®', '117 membranes, the relatively high proton conductivities of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles are noteworthy [32]. Li et al. have used sulfonated organosilica to modify Nafion® membranes and they found that the proton con-ductivities of the modified membranes were still lower than that of the neat Nafion® membrane. The reduction in the proton conductivity was attributed to the silica-induced changes in the tortuous paths and in the dis-tribution of hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains. However, in this work an enhancing effect on the proton conductivity was observed with addition of PSV and PVI grafted nanoparticles to PPBI mem-brane. The sulfonic and imidazole groups of modified nanoparticles also contribute in the acid-doping effect to PPBI polymer so as to enhance the proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles. Moreover, the presence of modified nanoparticles induces proton conductive pathways lead-ing to an increase in the proton conductivities of PPBI/modified nanoparticles membranes [24].

All the PPBI/modified nanoparticle membranes still exhibited higher proton conductivities than the pristine acid-doped PPBI membrane. Generally, two principle mechanisms of vehicle mechanism and Grotthuss mechanism (hopping) describe proton diffusion through the membrane [33]. It is possible that the bounded water par-ticipates by the Grotthuss mechanism, and the free water takes part mostly by vehicle mechanism [34]. Addition of silica-SO3H to the membranes increases the bounded water content in the membranes (Fig. 13). The bounded water facilitates the proton transport ability through the Grotthuss mechanism, originating by generation of a continuous proton conductive pathway. There-fore, the high proton conductivity of PPBI/modified nanoparticles can be attributed to the high bounded water content in the membrane. Since the Grotthuss-type diffusion mechanism without assis-tance of the vehicle mechanism has been proposed for the protonconductionunderanhydrousenvironments[35,36], theprotonconductivityoftheacid-dopedPPBI/modified nanoparticlemembranescouldbesynergisticallyresulted from their modified nanoparticle contents and the acid-doping levels.

Proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PSV-modified nanoparticles shows significant increase in comparison to PVI-modified ones in low temperature and high rel-ative humidity.

Consequently, high proton conductiv-ity can be a result of these changes. It should be mentioned that in temperatures higher than 100 ◦C and in very low relative humidity, water uptake of PSV-modified membranes decreases which leads to low efficiency of the sulfonic groups attached onto the surface of the nanoparticles which in turn results in a decrease in proton conduc-tivity in both membranes, but the increase in proton conductivity resulting from high doping level is significant and also the proton conductivity of PVI-modified nanocomposite membranes increase in high temperatures.

Introduction of modified and un-modified nanoparticles increases the brittleness of the nanocomposite mem-branes with a decrease in their elongations at break. The effects of modified and unmodified nanoparticles on the elongations at break of the nanocomposite membranes were different. The decrease in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness were widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inorganic reinforcement [37–39].

Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) of the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25�C exhibit a nanostructure which can be approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering (Percus Yevick approximation) and large scale water pockets. The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at 25 �C increased with increasing degree of sulfonation. SPTES-80 with highest degree of sulfonation (71.6%) showed a Guinier plateau at the very low q range (q < 1 �10�4 1/Å) indicating presence of isolated large scale morphology (Rg ¼ 1.3 �0.18 micron). The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to 55 �C, but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to 63.3% and 71.6% (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature (55 �C). The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by significant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of �4 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers. �2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction', 'Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [1,2]. Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through proton', 'exchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Nafion�as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18]. Transport properties and nanostructure of sulfonated polyimide (SPI) membranes have been studied using pulsed field gradient NMR and NMR quadrupolar relaxation rates determinations [19,20], and small angle scattering methods (SAXS and SANS), respectively [21,22].', '* Corresponding author.

We recently reported a class of ionomers based on aromatic hydrocarbon copolymers with high proton conductivity and excellent thermal mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states [22e29]. Sulfonated poly-arylenethioethersulfone(SPTES)copolymershavefollowing chemical structures (Fig. 1). SPTES copolymers including SPTES-50, SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80, have equivalent weight (EW) and IEC (mequiv./g) values of 610, 515, 459, 417, and 1.64, 1.94, 2.18, and 2.4, respectively [22]. They exhibited proton conductivity of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm respectively, at 65 �C and 85% relative humidity [22]. Their excellent proton conductivity at high temperatures combined with their high glass transition temperature (w200 �C) and mechanical stability (both in the dry and hydrated states) make them excellent potentials as high temperature PEM materials for fuel cells. SPTES-50 copolymer membrane has successfully been fabricated to membrane electrode assemblies and exhibited polarization curves and durability up to 400 h [29]. Their successful operations at 90e100 �C were limited by boiling point of water (100 �C at 1 atm). Replacing water molecules with heterocycles such as imidazolium where the charge carrier has a very low vapor pressure can result in proton conductivity at higher temperatures. Despite excellent electrochemical properties, excessive water uptake of SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes provide difficulties to be made as membrane electrode assembly [22,27] The proton transport and performance of SPTES copolymers highly depend on the presence of water molecules. In addition to the number of sulfonic groups, their acidity (pKa) ability to dissociate water molecules to proton, water activity coefficient, and number of water molecules associated with each sulfonic group, the supermolecular structure of the hydro-phobic and hydrophilic phases is also defined by polymer chain characteristics such as chain persistent length, and presence of sulfonic group on the backbone or in the side chains. We reported the presence of ionic nanodomains containing water molecules in the SPTES-70 using in-situ x-ray scattering [27]. The morphology and the nanostructure of SPTES-50 were approximated by corre-lated polydisperse spherical aggregates and a larger scale water domain network and were quantified by modeling of the SANS spectra with polydisperse hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [29]. This study reports the nanostructure and morphology of sulfonated polyarylenethioethersulfone (SPTES) copolymer membranes which is directly related to the proton transport through the membrane in terms of their degree of sulfonation and temperature dependency.', '2. Materials and methods', '2.1. Materials', 'Visually observed defect free films of SPTES copolymers were prepared by dissolving the purified copolymer in dimethyl acet-amide (DMAc, Sigma Aldrich) (5e10 wt%) filtering, placing in a flat dish in a vacuum oven with a gradual temperature rise to 100 �C for 24 h and 120 �C for 2 h. The resulting uniform flat films were immersed for 2 h in deionized water and dried under vacuum (24 h, 80 �C) after they were acidified in sulfuric acid (4 M, 24 h) to ensure complete conversion of sulfonic groups to their protonated forms.', '2.2. Characterization', 'SANS experiments were performed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Neutron Center for Research using 30 m NG-7 SANS instrument with a neutron wavelength, l, of 6 Å (Dl/l ¼ 10%) and three sample-to-detector distance of 1.5 m, 10 m (l ¼ 6 Å), and 15 m (l ¼ 8 Å), 0.001 < q < 0.3168 Å�1 at 25, and 55 �C (accuracy of 0.5 �C). Hydrated membranes were placed in demountable 1 mm thick titanium liquid cells filled with D2O after equilibrium in D2O (24 h). Scattered intensities were reduced, corrected for the transmission and background and placed on absolute scale. Then, circularly averaged to produce absolute scale scattering intensity, I(q), as a function of the wave vector, q, where q ¼ (4p/l)sin(q/2) and q is the scattering angle. Calculations were performed using Igor Pro�software [30,31]. USANS experiments covered a q-range of 0.00005 < q (Å�1) < 0.01, corresponding to a real-space length scale of 0.1 microne10 micron.', '3. Results and discussions', '3.1. Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 25 �C', 'SPTES copolymers have high proton conductivity at high relative humidities and elevated temperatures; e.g. 65 �C and 85% RH of 100, 145, 175, and 215 mS/cm for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers, respectively [27]. The degree of sulfonation increases for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6%, respectively. SPTES-50 copolymer has the lowest the degree of sulfonation and SPTES-80 copolymer has the highest degree of sulfonation in this class of copolymers [22,27]. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers at 25 �C show a scattering behavior of a two phase structure (Fig. 2a). The contribution of sulfonic groups to the scattering is considered to be negligible due to their small volume compared to the polymer and the water phase volume. It was visually observed that membranes do not dissociate when fully hydrated in the examined temperature. It was also determined by weight measurement that the membranes maintain the weight after deswelling. Therefore, the hydrophobic polymeric structure is the supporting network even at high water content and increased temperatures. Fig. 2a presents enhanced scattering intensity data (vertically shifted) for the hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copol-ymer membranes in the order of 20X, 1000X, and 2 �105X for the clarity of data presentation. The absolute scale scattering intensities in the medium q range of 0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1 are almost in the same intensity range for all SPTES copolymers. The high q scattering spectra for all copolymers exhibit a feature which is attributed to the presence of ionic domains containing water molecules. According to the scattering results, the morphology of all hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C can be approximated as correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates with liquid-like ordering (P.Y. ordering) and a power law decay [29]. The scattering data for the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 �C were compared and quantified using polydisperse (Schulz polydispersity) hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [32e34] and a low q power law decay [29]. The modeling of the SPETS 50 nanostructure and its properties have been reported elsewhere but presented here for', 'Fig. 1.

Yoonessi et al. / Polymer 52 (2011) 5615e56215616', 'clarity and completeness of the SPTES series analysis [29]. Fig. 2b shows the experimental scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 25 �C compared with the theoretical calculations of the model (solid line). The results of the comparison of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes scattering data with the model are summarized in Table 1. According to this modeling the domain radius increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 13.45,14.9,15.4, and 16.9 Å for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes. The hard sphere packing density increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 19.8%, 23%, 25%, 29% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. This could indicate that ionic domains are capable of holding more water molecules with the presence of more sulfonic groups on the polymer backbone (increasing the degree of sulfonation). The high-q scattering spectra exhibits onset of a peak formation when the degree of sulfonation was increased to 71.6% for SPTES-80 copolymer. Pres-ence of scattering maxima can be due to the scattering from an ordered structure (periodicity) or the oscillations resulted from the structural factor effects or the excluded volume effect arising from short range liquid-like ordering. The onset of peak formation is attributed to the excluded volume effects related to the liquid-like ordering [33e35]. The low-q power law decay of nearly �3 was observed for all SPTES copolymers in the range of 1 �10�4 < q (1/ Å) < 3 �10�3. The power law decay of �3 is attributed to the presence of interacting three-dimensional fractal morphology. In addition, a Guinier plateau [35] was present for the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer at the very low q (q (1/Å) < 9 �10�5). This is in addition to the nearly identical scattering intensity in the inter-mediate q-range (0.02 < q (1/Å) < 0.1). It can be concluded that the change in the degree of sulfonation had little or no effect on the intermediate and low angle scattering wave vector. The low-q power law decay was nearly �3 �0.1 for all SPTES copolymers. The presence of sharp interface between hydrophobic and hydro-philic domains was deduced from the power law decay of �4 at large angle wave vectors for all hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes. All scattering data presented in Fig. 2a shows a power slope of �3.85 to �4.15 which is approximated as w �4. The presence of Porod behavior (decay of �4) has been attributed to the two immiscible phase with a sharp boundary [35e37]. This shows that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are separated with a distinct interface containing sulfonic groups. Presence of a plateau in the scattering spectra is characteristics of isolated scatterers [35]. The radius of gyration (Rg) of the isolated scatterers can be approximated by IðqÞ ¼ I0expðð�q2R2gÞ=3Þ, where I0 is the extrapolated zero scattering intensity (Guinier approxi-mation) [35]. Presence of the Guinier plateau in the q range of 4.3 �10�5 < q (1/Å) < 8.2 �10�5 for SPTES-80 copolymer suggests segregation of the isolated large scale hydrophilic water pockets when the degree of sulfonation increased to 71.6%.

Hydrated SPTES copolymers at 55 �C', 'Based on the physical observations, water saturated membranes at 55 �C were swollen films without visual dissociation. Fig. 3 exhibits the scattering spectra of the fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes at 55 �C. The inter-mediate scattering intensity decreased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes start to form scattering maxima at high q range when the degree of sulfonation increased. This indicated the increase in the excluded volume due to the increase in the volume of the scatterers at higher degree of sulfonation and increased temperature (55 �C). The presence of scattering maxima is more significant for SPTES-70 copolymer and SPTES-80 copolymer with 63.3 and 71.6% degree of sulfonation. The large angle scattering feature shows scattering maxima at qmax of 0.103 and 0.1108 1/Å for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers which correspond to spatial characteristics lengths (l ¼ 2p/qmax) of 60.97 and 56.7 Å due to concentration fluctuations of hydrated domains (hard spheres). The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes changed significantlywith increasing degree of sulfonation. This indicates a substantial change in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology with increasing degree of sulfonation at 55 �C which is more pronounced for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers (degree of sulfonation 63.3 and 71.6%, respectively). Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are segregated distinctly by the sulfonic groups at the interface which is repre-sented by the Porod behavior, asymptotic behavior of w �4 for all SPTES copolymers [35e37]. The morphology of these membranes is complex and controlled by interfacial phenomena. The number of sulfonic groups per repeat unit volume and their acidity com-plemented with the chain persistent length and chain mobility are governing factors in the formed morphology. This study approxi-mates the morphology of the fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55 �C are approximated as spherical nanodomains containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering similar to their morphology at 25 �C. It is also proposed that this morphology changedtofractalmorphologywithincreasing temperature (increasing the intermediate scattering decay). The domain radius and the sphere packing density were increased from 26.4 Å and 28% for SPTES-50 copolymer to 32 Å and 33% for SPTES-60copolymerwhiletheintermediatescatteringintensity decreased. The domain radius and packing density of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane increased from 13.45 Å and 19.8% to 26.4 Å and 28% when the temperature increased from 25 �C to 55 �C with this approximation. The same increasing trend of 14.9 Åe32 Å for the average domain radius and 23%e33% of the sphere packing density was observed. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane compared to the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane is attributed to the disruption of the large scale morphology. The low q power law decay of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane was close to the decay of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane. The increase in the degree of sulfonation of SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymers from 54.9, to 63.3 and 71.6% resulted in a shift in the position of the high q scattering maxima of the hydrated membranes toward the large angle scattering regime. This peak formation is more prominent for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copoly-mers with higher sulfonation degree. The decrease in the inter-mediate scattering intensity in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70 and', '-80 copolymers is attributed to the loss of the large scale water network, intermediate fractal morphology within the polymer and onset of a morphology change to a two large scale phase morphology. The closed domain morphology of polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with fractal network were present for fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at 55�C (Figs. 3 and 4a). However, substantialchangesinthemorphologyoffullyhydrated membranes occurred when the degree of sulfonation is increased to 63.3 and 71.6% for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers at higher temperature of 55 �C. Combination of high temperature, high density of sulfonic groups, and significant amount of water mole-cules within the polymer backbone could have resulted in the coalescence of the small spherical ionic domains and fractal water network into a larger scale bicontinuous network of intermeshed hydrophobic and hydrophilic morphology for fully hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane at 55 �C. The bicontinuous model origi-nally proposed for micro-emulsion of two immiscible phases of water and oil with comparable amount based on Landau theory [38,39]. This model describes two irregular shapes with distinct boundary and has been used for intermesh of hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure when the particle shape is not well-defined [40,41]. This model proposes I(q) ¼ (a2þc1q þ c2q2)�1 for a2 > 0, c1 < 0, and c2 > 0, a single broad scattering maxima, and power law decay of �4 at large scattering angles. Two characteristics lengths of d and x are deduced from this analysis having a2, c1, and c2[39,40], d is the domain periodicity or interdomain distance and x is the correlation length which has been attributed to the dispersion of d. According to this theory, c1 is negative due to the surfactant. The absolute values of c1 and the ratio of x/d should increase with increasing surfactant. The specific internal surface area can be derived from the ratio of S/V ¼ 44(1�4)/x [38,39]. The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane has a low-q upturn, a lower intermediate scattering intensity compared to the hydrated SPTES-60 and SPTES-50 copolymers, and a large angle maxima followed by a power law decay of �4. This indicates the onset of the coalescence of the ionic aggregates, disruption of the fractal water network, and the formation of the two irregular large scale bicontinuous phase morphology. The high q range (q > 0.037 1/Å) of the scattering', 'Fig. 3. Scattering spectra of fully hydrated (D2O) SPTES copolymers at 55 �C. The high q scattering exhibit a power law decay of �4. High q range maxima position of hydrated SPTES-60, SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 shifts toward higher q with increasing degree of sulfonation.', 'M. Yoonessi et al. / Polymer 52 (2011) 5615e56215618', 'spectra of the hydrated SPTES-70 copolymer membrane at 55 �C was compared with the T.S. bicontinuous model (Fig. 4b). This simulation resulted in a periodicity, d, of 59.9 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima position, 60.97 Å. According to this simulation, the correlation length (x) is 31.14 Å. The medium-q range scattering still exhibits the larger scale morphology which is not completely converted to the bi-continuous phase morphology. However, they are partially collapsed characterized by a lower scattering intensity in the intermediate q range. The high q maxima followed by a power law decay of �4 is approximated as bicontinuous morphology. The low and medium q (q < 0.037 1/Å) scattering spectra of the SPTES 70 is due to the presence of fractal network of waters which have not coalesce yet. The scattering spectra of the SPTES-80 copolymer are consistent with a bicontinuous two phase structure of irregular shapes with sulfonic groups as interfacial ionic region. The scattering experi-mental data of the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer membrane was compared with this model (q > 0.015 1/Å), (Fig. 4c and Table 2). The periodicity of the water domains (or hydrophobic domains), d, predicted by this model is w54 Å which is in excellent agreement with the one obtained from the scattering maxima (qmax), 56.7 Å. This value is the distance between water domains. The correlation length (x) obtained from this model is 37.86 Å which is a measure of dispersion. The distance between the water phases, periodicity, was decreased from 59.9 Å to 54 Å with increasing degree of sulfona-tion. The correlation length, x, was increased from 31.14 Å to 37.86 Å when the degree of sulfonation increased. Increasing the interfacial area results in an increase in the x/d ratio. The presence of the upturn in the low range of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 at 55 �C (Fig. 4b and c) is attributed to the fractal morphology of the large scale features.', '3.3. Discussions', 'Scattering data of series of SPTES membranes were obtained in the full hydration state with increasing the sulfonation degree in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and 71.6% for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. Complete study was performed to provide understanding membranes morphology with increasing the temperature of the hydrated membranes from 25 �C to 55 �C. Proposed model assumes spherical nanodomains containing water molecules forming from clustering of the sulfonation groups. This assumption was performed based on previously reported study which showed spherical nanodomains in the dry SPTES 50 membrane under HR-TEM [29]. The scattering spectra of the membranes with high degree of sulfonation (SPTES 70, and 80) changed significantly when the temperature increased to 55 �C.

This model predicted that the increase in the degree of sulfonation resulted in an increase in the radius of ionic domains and an increase in the volume packing density of water in the aggregates. It was assumed that the same morphology of polydisperse correlated spherical ionic domains were present in the SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymers when the temperature increased to 55 �C.

The polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles were utilized as a functional additive to prepare PPBI/polymer-grafted SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. Imida-zole and sulfonated vinylbenzene groups on the surface of modified nanoparticles forming linkages with PPBI chains, improved the compatibility between PPBI and nanoparticles, and enhanced the mechanical strength of the prepared nanocomposite membranes. The prepared nanocomposite membranes showed higher water uptake and acid doping levels comparing to PPBI. Also, after acid doping with phosphoric acid, nanocomposite membranes exhibited enhanced proton conductivity in comparison to the pristine PPBI and PPBI/un-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanocomposite membranes. The enhancement in proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes resulted from modified SiO2 nanoparticles showed higher conductivity than modified TiO2 nanoparticles.

Introduction', 'In recent years, polymeric electrolytes based on hydrocarbons have been considered as an alternative for Nafion® membranes for high temperature polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Due to its high proton conductivity, Nafion® is an appropriate option to use in polymeric electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). The great proton conduc-tivity of Nafion® membranes can be resulted from the presence of sulfonate groups in polymer structure and its adsorbed water. Because of water removal at temperatures above 80 ◦C, the pro-ton conductivity of membranes decreases dramatically leading to a poor performance in fuel cells. In addition, the reason for the scientific enthusiasm for utilizing the fuel cells at elevated temper-atures is that there is no need to use high-purity hydrogen at higher temperatures; besides, CO-existing in the H2 fuel does not load to the poisoning of electro-catalysts. Furthermore, at higher temper-atures, the rate of red-ox reaction on electrolytes increases. On the other hand, there would be less need for the use of heat exchang-', '∗Corresponding author.

Sulfonated polysulfone (PSF) [4], polyetheretherketone (PEEK) [5,6] and polybenzimidazoles (PBIs) [7–11] are among poly-mers which can be used as alternatives for Nafion in PEFCs. Amongpolybenzimidazolederivatives,poly[2,2-5,5(m-phenylene)-bibenzimidazole](PBI),whichisalsocalled commercial polybenzimidazole have been used as a mem-brane material in PEMFCs. Having high chemical as well as thermal resistance and proton conductivity, polybenzimidazoles are great options to be used in the fuel cells with function at elevated temperatures above 100 ◦C [12]. PBIs should have enough proton conductivity so that it could be used as proton exchange membranes in the fuel cells. To achieve this purpose, they are usually doped with a sufficient acid like H3PO4 to an appropriate doping level [13]. Nanocomposite membranes are a new group of membranes which contain nanopar-ticles such as SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 and other compounds [14–21]. The introduction of nanoparticles into the membranes results in a considerable improvement in their features like mechani-cal properties, methanol permeability, but in some cases leads to a decrease in proton conductivity [22–24]. In order to over-come this problem, surface functionalized nanoparticles, which means various compounds with polar groups grafted chemically', '0378-7753/$ – see front matter © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

As men-tioned before, the numerous research works were done concerning grafting various compounds on the SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles which used for different purposes. However, in this work, we have used monomer bearing functional groups like imidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene which can improve the properties of pro-ton conductive membranes. These monomers are polymerized on the surface of the nanoparticles and as a consequence, they can more affect the properties of the membranes than while one functional group is grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. In addition, the polymerization of the selected monomers such as vinylimidazole and sulfonated vinylbenzene on the surface of nanoparticle could cause more compatibility between nanopar-ticles and polymer matrix which finally improve the mechanical properties. In this work, nanocomposite membranes were prepared using various amounts of modified TiO2 and SiO2 nanoparticles and newly synthesized polybenzimidazole was depicted poly[2,2-5,5-(m-pyrazolidene)-bibenzimidazole] (PPBI). Modification of the mentioned nanoparticles was performed by radical polymerization of some vinyl monomers such as sulfonated styrene and vinylim-idazole on the surface of the nanoparticles to which vinylic group was bounded covalently.

The absence of absorbent peak related to amine group proton (N–H) in the area of 4.0–5.0 ppm and an absorbent related to amide group in the area of 10.3–10.6 ppm show the complete closure of imidazole rings during the polycondensation reaction. In FT-IR characteristics of PPBI, the presence of absorbent bands in 800 cm−1 is related to the vibration of C–H bond of imida-zole, a band in about 1300 cm−1 is related to the vibration of C–N', 'Fig. 3. The 1H NMR spectrum of PPBI.', '2576H. Namazi, H. Ahmadi / Journal of Power Sources 196 (2011) 2573–2583', 'Fig. 4.

All the above absorbent bands confirm the synthesis of PPBI. Furthermore, the absence of the absorbent band related to the carbonyl group in the vicinity of 1760 cm−1 can be confirmed as an evidence of the completion of cyclization reaction. The FT-IR spectra of modified and un-modified SiO2 nanoparti-cles are shown in Fig. 4(a and b, c), respectively. The presence of the absorbent bands in 3050 cm−1 and 3100 cm−1 can be related to aromatic C–H bonds and also the existence of bands in the area of 2950 cm−1 can be attributed to aliphatic C–H bonds. Also the peaks in 1619 and 1419 cm−1 can be due to C C and C N bonds. In', 'Fig. 4(c), the presence of the absorbent band in 1257 cm−1 is cor-responded to S O bond of the sulfonic acid group. These prove the existence of polymeric chains that are grafted onto the nanoparticle surface. FT-IR spectra of the modified nanoparticles have been measured after complete washing and drying. To be sure of the chemical bonding of all chains (not physical) onto the particle surface, some un-modified nanoparticles were mixed with polymeric solutions of PVI and PSV and were stirred for 1 h. After filtration, the washing method used to wash the modified nanoparticles, was applied to the resulting powder as well. The FT-IR spectrum of the obtained powder did not show any absorbent bands related to PVI and PSV chains. The absorbent bands, which existed in the spectrum of mod-ified nanoparticles, were not observed in this spectrum. So, it was indicated that the polymeric chains have been attached to the par-ticles surface via covalent bonds.', '3.2. Thermal analysis', 'Thermogravimetric analysis diagrams of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles are shown in Fig. 5. Weight loss in 85 ◦C can be related to the release of physically absorbed water. In un-modified nanoparticles, the minor weight loss in elevated temperatures can be attributed to the loss of hydroxyl groups of the particle surface attached by covalent bonds. Weight loss in modified nanoparticles could be a result of thermal degradation of the polymeric chains grafted to the surface of the nanoparti-cles. Also, the weight loss in 230–300 ◦C was due to the thermal decomposition of the sulfonate groups in the grafted PSV chains [30]. Thermograms of PVI modified nanocomposite with 5, 10 and 15% of TiO2 are shown in Fig. 6. As it is observed, the thermal prop-erties of the nanocomposites prepared with various amounts of TiO2 are almost similar. For this reason, in order to compare the thermal properties of other nanocomposites which prepared with', 'Fig. 5. TGA thermograms of modified and un-modified a) SiO2 and b) TiO2.', 'H. Namazi, H.

The remaining weight percentage in 850 ◦C is related to the modified TiO2 that is less than the added amount of PVI-modified TiO2 nanoparticles when the membrane was prepared. This decrease in weight in comparison with the theoretical amount could be related due to the degradation of the chains grafted onto the surface of the nanoparticles. Also, in order to obtain the par-ticular weight of the modified nanoparticles, specific amounts of modified and un-modified nanoparticles were weighed after and before complete burning out all the polymers. They were heated to temperatures about 1000 ◦C for 30 min and the obtained nanoparti-cles were weighed immediately. The difference between the weight of un-modified nanoparticles before and after heating shows the amount of lost water which was either physically absorbed or pro-duced from the condensation reaction of the hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticle surface.

The obtained results and theoretical amounts are shown in Table 1. The amounts of the obtained results in all cases are more than theoretical values. This could be related to the presence of free water molecules and hydroxyl groups on the nanoparticles surface in which their values are not subtracted from theoretical values. The diagrams of thermogravimetric analysis of both PPBI and nanocomposites prepared from the modified nanoparticles (10% w/w) are shown in Fig. 7. The weight loss observed in the tempera-ture range of 50–140 ◦C is a result of the release of water adsorbed into the membranes which is less significant in nanocomposites in comparison to pure membrane. The second loss in weight, observed at the temperature range of 500–530 ◦C, is also attributed to the thermal degradation of poly-meric backbone of the nanocomposite membranes which is almost identical to the degradation temperature of pure PPBI. As a result, the addition of both modified and un-modified nanoparticles do not have any noticeable effect on thermal stability of the prepared nanocomposites. As it is observed in Fig. 7, the degradation of PVI-modified nanoparticles occurs at 185 ◦C which is lower than the related tem-perature of PSV-modified ones. Therefore, the former one can be used in fuel cells with performance under 150 ◦C, but PSV-modified membrane is more suitable in high temperature fuel cells.', 'Fig. 7.

Water uptake and doping level', 'Water uptake amount of nanocomposite membranes contain-ing 5, 10 and 15% of modified nanoparticles at 25 ◦C are shown in Fig. 8. Addition of silica nanoparticles to PPBI membranes increased their water uptakes due to the hygroscopic nature of SiO2 and TiO2nanoparticles. The sulfonic and imidazole groups in the nanopar-ticles increased the water uptake to a greater extent. The amount of water uptake for PPBI/TiO2-PSV, PPBI/SiO2-PSV, PPBI/TiO2-PVI and PPBI/SiO2-PVI are 21.6, 22.7, 20.4 and 21.9%, respectively. The effect of sulfonic acid groups of PSV chains grafted onto the nanoparticle surface on the water uptake is more than imidazole groups in PVI chains due to the higher hygroscopic properties of PSV comparing to PVI chains grafted on to the silica nanopar-ticle surface. The water uptake of PPBI/SiO2-PSV is higher than PPBI/TiO2-PSV which can be due to the further increase of the surface of SiO2 nanoparticles in comparison to TiO2 nanoparticle surface. The PPBI-based membranes were doped with 85% H3PO4 to prepare the acid-doped membranes. Fig. 9 shows the acid-doping levels of the PPBI-based nanocomposite membranes. Acid-doping level (H3PO4 molecules per PPBI repeating unit) of pristine PPBI membrane was 13.5, which decreased to 11.8 for PPBI/SiO2, 12.0 for PPBI/SiO2-PSV, 11.7 for PPBI/TiO2 and 12.2 for PPBI/TiO2-PSV', 'Fig. 9.

Some of the amino groups in PPBI chains were blocked with the sulfonic acid groups of TiO2-PSV and SiO2-PSV, to decrease the binding ability of PPBI chains to H3PO4molecules. Among the prepared nanocomposites, the water uptake in PPBI/SiO2-PSV and acid doping in PPBI/SiO2-PVI were the most one. Even in the comparison of these membranes with the simi-lar ones which prepared from modified TiO2 such as PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, the amount of water uptake and doping level were higher. This shows that using modified SiO2 nanoparticles in fuel cells is more appropriate.', '3.4.

Then, the MEA (Mem-brane Electrolyte Assembly) was inputted in the steam autoclave equipped with temperature controller. For measurement of pro-ton conductivity, the steam autoclave supplied with steam from a house generator for exposure to saturated steam at desired temperature. As an example, for saturated steam the pressure cor-responding to 120 ◦C is 205 kPa. The time of exposure to saturated steam at 120 ◦C was 30 min that this value for temperature of 140 ◦C was increased to 50 min.', 'Fig. 10 shows the Nyquist plot and equivalent circuit of studied membranes at 25 ◦C and RH 100% for some membranes. After fitting the EIS experimental data on the electrical equiv-alent circuit, the membrane proton conductivity was determined from the intercept of EIS data with real impedance Z′ axis (as the value of Rm element).

Proton conductivities of PPBI based nanocomposite membranes containing SiO2 (a) and TiO2 (b) nanoparticles at 100% relative humidity up to 80 ◦C.', 'other nanocomposite membranes like Nafion®/silica membranes and PBI/silica membranes [31]. On the other hand, comparing the pristine PPBI and Nafion®', '117 membranes, the relatively high proton conductivities of the nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles are noteworthy [32]. Li et al. have used sulfonated organosilica to modify Nafion® membranes and they found that the proton con-ductivities of the modified membranes were still lower than that of the neat Nafion® membrane. The reduction in the proton conductivity was attributed to the silica-induced changes in the tortuous paths and in the dis-tribution of hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains. However, in this work an enhancing effect on the proton conductivity was observed with addition of PSV and PVI grafted nanoparticles to PPBI mem-brane. The sulfonic and imidazole groups of modified nanoparticles also contribute in the acid-doping effect to PPBI polymer so as to enhance the proton conductivity of nanocomposite membranes prepared from modified nanoparticles. Moreover, the presence of modified nanoparticles induces proton conductive pathways lead-ing to an increase in the proton conductivities of PPBI/modified nanoparticles membranes [24]. The proton conductivities of the acid-doped nanocompos-ite membranes containing SiO2 and TiO2 (Fig. 12) were further', 'Fig. 12. Proton conductivities of PPBI based nanocomposite membranes containing SiO2 (a) and TiO2 (b) nanoparticles at dry environment up to 145 ◦C.', 'studied at high temperatures under an anhydrous environment. All the PPBI/modified nanoparticle membranes still exhibited higher proton conductivities than the pristine acid-doped PPBI membrane. Generally, two principle mechanisms of vehicle mechanism and Grotthuss mechanism (hopping) describe proton diffusion through the membrane [33]. It is possible that the bounded water par-ticipates by the Grotthuss mechanism, and the free water takes part mostly by vehicle mechanism [34]. Addition of silica-SO3H to the membranes increases the bounded water content in the membranes (Fig. 13). The bounded water facilitates the proton transport ability through the Grotthuss mechanism, originating by generation of a continuous proton conductive pathway. There-fore, the high proton conductivity of PPBI/modified nanoparticles can be attributed to the high bounded water content in the membrane. Since the Grotthuss-type diffusion mechanism without assis-tance of the vehicle mechanism has been proposed for the protonconductionunderanhydrousenvironments[35,36], theprotonconductivityoftheacid-dopedPPBI/modified nanoparticlemembranescouldbesynergisticallyresulted from their modified nanoparticle contents and the acid-doping levels. Consequently, the highest proton conductivity was obtained withtheacid-dopedPPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%membraneathigh humidity and low temperatures and PPBI/SiO2-PVI-15% mem-brane in high temperatures and low humidity, which possesses the moderate modified nanoparticles content and acid-doping level.

Also, according to Fig. 8, water uptake of the membrane shows an increase when using higher amounts of modified nanoparticles. This increase in PSV-modified nanocomposite membranesishigherinPVI-modified one. Proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PSV-modified nanoparticles shows significant increase in comparison to PVI-modified ones in low temperature and high rel-ative humidity. But in high temperature and low relative humidity, proton conductivity of the nanocomposite membranes obtained from PVI-modified nanoparticles is observed to be more than PSV-modified ones and even at 145 ◦C the proton conductivity of PPBI/SiO2-PVI 15% is more than PPBI/SiO2-PSV-15%. The exis-tence of modified nanoparticles in PPBI nanocomposite membranes results in high proton conductivity in three ways:', '1) With increase in water uptake 2) With increase in the amount of doping level and 3) With increase in the number of proton conductive functional groups such as sulfonic acid group.', 'In PSV-modified nanocomposite membranes, acid doping decreases while the water uptake and the number of sulfonic acid groups shows an increase. Consequently, high proton conductiv-ity can be a result of these changes. It should be mentioned that in temperatures higher than 100 ◦C and in very low relative humidity, water uptake of PSV-modified membranes decreases which leads to low efficiency of the sulfonic groups attached onto the surface of the nanoparticles which in turn results in a decrease in proton conduc-tivity in both membranes, but the increase in proton conductivity resulting from high doping level is significant and also the proton conductivity of PVI-modified nanocomposite membranes increase in high temperatures. It is noteworthy that Nafion® 117 shows relatively low pro-ton conductivities under anhydrous conditions and almost lacks its proton conductivities at high temperatures. Comparing to Nafion®', '117 membranes, the high proton conductivities of PBI/SiO2-PVI 10% indicate that this membrane could be utilized as proton exchange membranes for fuel cell at high temperatures and dry conditions.', '3.5.

Pristine', 'PPBI membrane showed an elongation at break of 38%. Mod-ification of nanocomposites with SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles results in an increase in the tensile strengths and a subse-quent decrease in the elongations at break for the PPBI-based membranes. For PPBI/modified nanoparticles nanocomposites membranes (PPBI/modified nanocomposite consists of the PPBI and surface-modified SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles by PVI and PSV chains and PPBI/unmodified nanocomposite includes PPBI and SiO2 and TiO2 nanoparticles without any treatment), the presence of ionic linkages between PPBI and silica particles can be assigned to their high Young’s modulus. Introduction of modified and un-modified nanoparticles increases the brittleness of the nanocomposite mem-branes with a decrease in their elongations at break. The effects of modified and unmodified nanoparticles on the elongations at break of the nanocomposite membranes were different. The decrease in the elongation at break and increase in the brittleness were widely observed with polymer nanocomposites and could be attributed to the presence of inorganic reinforcement [37–39]. Moreover, the ionic linkages in nanocomposite membranes prepared from modi-fied nanoparticles are higher than hydrogen bonding in PPBI/SiO2and PPBI/TiO2.', 'Fig. 14.

The brittleness of membranes pre-pared from TiO2-PVI and SiO2-PVI are less than PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PSV membranes which are perhaps due to more com-patibility of PVI grafted chains onto the nanoparticles surface with PPBI backbone. Comparing the brittleness of the nanocomposite membranes of the PPBI/SiO2-PSV and PPBI/SiO2-PVI with PPBI/TiO2-PSV and PPBI/TiO2-PVI, respectively indicates that the brittleness of the membranes prepared with modified SiO2 nanoparticles is less than the modified TiO2 ones.', '3.6.

As seen in Fig. 15, TiO2-PSV nanoparticles are dispersed homo-geneously in PPBI matrixes and are increased with increasing of the percentage of TiO2-PSV nanoparticles.

The compatibility between PPBI and unmodified nanoparticles and the homogene-ity of the PPBI/SiO2 or PPBI/TiO2 membranes are somewhat poor [32]. However, the dispersion homogeneity of silica nanoparticles in PPBI membranes could be significantly improved with using surface modified nanoparticles as the additives. As shown in Fig. 16(b), the dispersion homogeneity of modified nanoparticles is observed in the TEM micrograph of PPBI/PSV-SiO2 nanocomposite membrane, which demonstrates high compatibility between PPBI polymer and PSV-SiO2 nanoparticles and the high dispersion abil-ity of PSV-SiO2 in PPBI matrix.
