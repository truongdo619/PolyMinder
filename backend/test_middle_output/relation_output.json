In this work , we investigate the effect of polymer crystallinity on the dopant distribution along the thickness direction of sequentially solution - doped conjugated polymer films . Using regioregular poly ( 3 - hexylthiophene ) ( P3HT ) as a model conjugated polymer , we characterized the dopant distribution by varying the crystallinity of the polymer film via thermal annealing . Under the same conditions of sequential solution doping , it was found that while the overall dopant content within two polymer films with different degrees of crystallinity was almost similar , the distribution of dopants along the depth direction was different . The film with higher crystallinity exhibited greater nonuniformity in dopant distribution , with the ratio of dopant content between the film surface and bulk being higher in the film with greater crystallinity compared to the film with lower crystallinity .

Both P3HT - A and P3HT - T films showed similar changes in spectral shapes upon doping . In the undoped state , they showed an absorption band in the visible - wavelength range at around 300 \u2013 650 nm , with a maximum absorption at 550 nm . The higher crystallinity of the P3HT - T film compared to that of the P3HT - A film could be confirmed again by the more pronounced absorption shoulder at ~ 600 nm in the P3HT - T film [ 33 ] . Upon doping the polymer films with F4TCNQ , a decrease in the initial absorption at around 500 nm and the emergence of a broad absorption peak between 1000 and 2000 nm were observed , due to the formation of positive polarons in P3HT [ 27 , 35 ] . Additionally , distinct peaks at 413 , 770 , and 870 nm appeared in the spectra of doped polymer films , which are well known to be associated with the F4TCNQ anions formed by the electron transfer from P3HT to F4TCNQ upon doping [ 27 ] . The decrease in the initial absorption intensity and the increase of newly formed absorption peaks due to doping became more pronounced as the dopant concentration in solution increased , indicating a higher doping level of P3HT for the film doped with the dopant solution of greater concentration . When comparing the spectra of P3HT - A and P3HT - T films doped at the same dopant concentration , the intensities of P3HT positive polarons and F4TCNQ anions were slightly greater in P3HT - T than in P3HT - A ; this was observed for all dopant concentrations tested . The greater polymer positive polaron and dopant anion intensities in P3HT - T than in P3HT - A , despite nearly the same dopant contents within them , suggested that the ionization of the dopant was slightly more efficient in the P3HT - T film than in the P3HT - A film , likely due to its greater degree of crystallinity and charge delocalization [ 36 ] .

According to previous studies on the swelling of semicrystalline polymers , polymer crystallites are hardly penetrable to solvents , and thus , swelling occurs predominantly in the amorphous phase of the polymer films [ 42 , 43 ] . Therefore , the trend of decreasing swelling ratio with respect to increasing polymer crystallinity can be understood as a result of the greater content of polymer crystallites within the film with higher crystallinity than that within the film with lower crystallinity . Based on this knowledge , we speculated that the swellability of P3HT thin films would change as a result of varied crystallinity of the films via thermal annealing ; that is , the P3HT - T film would exhibit a smaller swelling ratio than the P3HT - A film when they reached swelling equilibrium with ACN due to its greater crystallinity . This speculation was shown to be valid by directly measuring the thickness of P3HT - A and P3HT - T films before and after swelling ( Fig. 4 ) . Film thicknesses were measured using an ellipsometer , fitting the recorded spectral data using the Cauchy model . In the fitting process , only the wavelength region of 860 \u2013 1000 nm was used to avoid the excitonic absorption peaks of the polymer films . In swelling the polymer films , pure ACN was used as the swelling agent , because it is the solvent of the F4TCNQ dopant solution used in our sequential solution doping process . The detailed procedure for swelling polymer films is provided in the Experimental section . After dipping the P3HT - A and P3HT - T polymer films in pure ACN for 5 min , the thickness of the films increased considerably compared to the initial ( i.e. , dried - state ) thickness , indicating the uptake of ACN molecules in the polymer films . While the thicknesses of the dried P3HT - A and P3HT - T films are almost identical at ~ 47 nm , the thicknesses of the swelled films were significantly different , showing 53 ( \u00b1 1.5 ) and 49 ( \u00b1 0.2 ) nm for P3HT - A and P3HT - T , respectively ( Fig. 4a ) . The corresponding percent increase in the film thickness was 11.3 % for P3HT - A and 4.0 % for P3HT - T ( Fig. 4b ) . These results clearly show that the swellability of the P3HT films depends significantly on their crystallinities .

When the two films were sequentially doped with a dopant solution under the same conditions , they showed nearly the same dopant content over the entire film but had different dopant distributions along the depth direction ; the film with greater crystallinity exhibited a more uneven distribution of the dopant compared to that with lower crystallinity , with a higher composition of the dopant at the surface than in the bulk . The difference in the dopant distributions was attributed to the different degree of swelling between the two films . That is , the film with higher crystallinity swelled less by the dopant solvent , which likely resulted in a relatively less efficient diffusion of the dopant from the surface into the bulk , leading to a higher concentration of dopant near the surface compared to the bulk .
