The ionic domain radius and the volume packing density of the aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes at $25~^{\\circ}C$ increased with increasing degree of sulfonation.

The radius of spherical ionic aggregates present in the hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes increased with increasing temperature to $55~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ , but the large scale morphology changed to a fractal network. Further increase of the sulfonation degree to $63.3\\%$ and $71.6\\%$ (SPTES-70 and SPTES-80) resulted in a substantial morphology change of the spherical aggregates to an irregular bicontinuous hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology for the hydrated SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes at $55~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . Presence of ionic maxima followed by a power law decay of $-4$ for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes was attributed to the bicontinuous phase morphology at high degree of sulfonation and elevated temperature $(55^{\\circ}C)$ . The disruption of the larger scale fractal morphology was characterized by significant decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity. Hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains were separated distinctly by sulfonic groups at the interface showing as power law decay of \u00044 for all hydrated SPTES copolymers. ",

Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells. Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [3e5]. Therefore, transport of protons and hydronium ions through proton exchange membrane (PEM) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell. High proton conductivity, impermeability to reactant gases, high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states, water uptake, dimensional stability, and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells. The structure, dynamics, and transport characteristics of Nafion\u0003 as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering (SANS) [6e11], small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) [12e16], quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) [17], and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) [18].

They exhibited proton conductivity of 100, 145, 175, and $215\\:\\mathrm{mS/cm}$ respectively, at $65^{\\circ}{\\mathsf{C}}$ and $85\\%$ relative humidity [22]. Their excellent proton conductivity at high temperatures combined with their high glass transition temperature $(\\sim200^{\\circ}C)$ and mechanical stability (both in the dry and hydrated states) make them excellent potentials as high temperature PEM materials for fuel cells. SPTES50 copolymer membrane has successfully been fabricated to membrane electrode assemblies and exhibited polarization curves and durability up to $400\\mathrm{~h~}$ [29]. Their successful operations at $90{-}100^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ were limited by boiling point of water ( $100^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ at 1 atm). Replacing water molecules with heterocycles such as imidazolium where the charge carrier has a very low vapor pressure can result in proton conductivity at higher temperatures. Despite excellent electrochemical properties, excessive water uptake of SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymer membranes provide difficulties to be made as membrane electrode assembly [22,27] The proton transport and performance of SPTES copolymers highly depend on the presence of water molecules. In addition to the number of sulfonic groups, their acidity $\\left(\\mathsf{p K}_{\\mathsf{a}}\\right)$ ability to dissociate water molecules to proton, water activity coefficient, and number of water molecules associated with each sulfonic group, the supermolecular structure of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic phases is also defined by polymer chain characteristics such as chain persistent length, and presence of sulfonic group on the backbone or in the side chains. We reported the presence of ionic nanodomains containing water molecules in the SPTES-70 using in-situ x-ray scattering [27]. The morphology and the nanostructure of SPTES-50 were approximated by correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates and a larger scale water domain network and were quantified by modeling of the SANS spectra with polydisperse hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [29]. This study reports the nanostructure and morphology of sulfonated polyarylenethioethersulfone (SPTES) copolymer membranes which is directly related to the proton transport through the membrane in terms of their degree of sulfonation and temperature dependency.

        "text": "SPTES copolymers have high proton conductivity at high relative humidities and elevated temperatures; e.g. $65~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and $85\\%$ RH of 100, 145, 175, and $215\\mathrm{m}S/\\mathrm{cm}$ for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers, respectively [27]. The degree of sulfonation increases for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and $\\scriptstyle-80$ copolymers in the order of 45.04, 54.9, 63.3, and $71.6\\%$ respectively. SPTES-50 copolymer has the lowest the degree of sulfonation and SPTES-80 copolymer has the highest degree of sulfonation in this class of copolymers [22,27]. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated $(\\mathrm{D}_{2}\\mathrm{O})$ SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers at $25~^{\\circ}C$ show a scattering behavior of a two phase structure (Fig. 2a). The contribution of sulfonic groups to the scattering is considered to be negligible due to their small volume compared to the polymer and the water phase volume. It was visually observed that membranes do not dissociate when fully hydrated in the examined temperature. It was also determined by weight measurement that the membranes maintain the weight after deswelling. Therefore, the hydrophobic polymeric structure is the supporting network even at high water content and increased temperatures. Fig. 2a presents enhanced scattering intensity data (vertically shifted) for the hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes in the order of 20X, 1000X, and $2\\times10^{5}\\mathrm{X}$ for the clarity of data presentation. The absolute scale scattering intensities in the medium q range of $0.02<q(1/\\mathring{\\mathsf{A}})<0.1$ are almost in the same intensity range for all SPTES copolymers. The high $q$ scattering spectra for all copolymers exhibit a feature which is attributed to the presence of ionic domains containing water molecules. According to the scattering results, the morphology of all hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at $25~^{\\circ}C$ can be approximated as correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates with liquid-like ordering (P.Y. ordering) and a power law decay [29]. The scattering data for the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes at $25~^{\\circ}C$ were compared and quantified using polydisperse (Schulz polydispersity) hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid-like ordering [32e34] and a low $q$ power law decay [29]. The modeling of the SPETS 50 nanostructure and its properties have been reported elsewhere but presented here for clarity and completeness of the SPTES series analysis [29]. Fig. 2b shows the experimental scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES70 copolymer membrane at $25~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ compared with the theoretical calculations of the model (solid line). The results of the comparison of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes scattering data with the model are summarized in Table 1. According to this modeling the domain radius increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 13.45, 14.9, 15.4, and $16.9\\mathring{\\mathrm{A}}$ for SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes. The hard sphere packing density increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of $19.8\\%$ , $23\\%$ , $25\\%$ , $29\\%$ for SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes. This could indicate that ionic domains are capable of holding more water molecules with the presence of more sulfonic groups on the polymer backbone (increasing the degree of sulfonation). The high-q scattering spectra exhibits onset of a peak formation when the degree of sulfonation was increased to $71.6\\%$ for SPTES-80 copolymer. Presence of scattering maxima can be due to the scattering from an ordered structure (periodicity) or the oscillations resulted from the structural factor effects or the excluded volume effect arising from short range liquid-like ordering. The onset of peak formation is attributed to the excluded volume effects related to the liquid-like ordering [33e35]. The low-q power law decay of nearly $^{-3}$ was observed for all SPTES copolymers in the range of $1\\times10^{-4}<q(1/$ $\\mathring{\\mathbf{A}})<3\\times10^{-3}$ . The power law decay of $^{-3}$ is attributed to the presence of interacting three-dimensional fractal morphology. In addition, a Guinier plateau [35] was present for the hydrated SPTES-80 copolymer at the very low $q(q(1/\\mathring{A})<9\\times10^{-5})$ . This is in addition to the nearly identical scattering intensity in the intermediate $\\mathbf{q}.$ -range $(0.02<q(1/\\mathring{\\mathsf{A}})<0.1)$ . It can be concluded that the change in the degree of sulfonation had little or no effect on the intermediate and low angle scattering wave vector. The low-q power law decay was nearly $-3\\pm0.1$ for all SPTES copolymers. The presence of sharp interface between hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains was deduced from the power law decay of $-4$ at large angle wave vectors for all hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes. All scattering data presented in Fig. 2a shows a power slope of $-3.85$ to $-4.15$ which is approximated as $\\sim-4$ . The presence of Porod behavior (decay of \u00044) has been attributed to the two immiscible phase with a sharp boundary [35e37]. This shows that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are separated with a distinct interface containing sulfonic groups. ",

Fig. 3 exhibits the scattering spectra of the fully hydrated $(\\mathrm{D}_{2}\\mathrm{O})$ SPTES50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymer membranes at $55~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . The intermediate scattering intensity decreased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymers. The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes start to form scattering maxima at high $q$ range when the degree of sulfonation increased. This indicated the increase in the excluded volume due to the increase in the volume of the scatterers at higher degree of sulfonation and increased temperature $(55~^{\\circ}C)$ . The presence of scattering maxima is more significant for SPTES-70 copolymer and SPTES-80 copolymer with 63.3 and $71.6\\%$ degree of sulfonation. The large angle scattering feature shows scattering maxima at $q_{\\mathrm{max}}$ of 0.103 and $0.11081/\\mathring{\\mathsf{A}}$ for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers which correspond to spatial characteristics lengths $(l=2\\pi/q_{\\mathrm{max}})$ of 60.97 and $56.7\\mathrm{~\\AA~}$ due to concentration fluctuations of hydrated domains (hard spheres). The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES-50, -60, -70, and -80 copolymer membranes changed significantly with increasing degree of sulfonation. This indicates a substantial change in the hydrophobic/hydrophilic morphology with increasing degree of sulfonation at $55~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ which is more pronounced for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers (degree of sulfonation 63.3 and $71.6\\%$ respectively). Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are segregated distinctly by the sulfonic groups at the interface which is represented by the Porod behavior, asymptotic behavior of $\\sim-4$ for all SPTES copolymers [35e37]. The morphology of these membranes is complex and controlled by interfacial phenomena. The number of sulfonic groups per repeat unit volume and their acidity complemented with the chain persistent length and chain mobility are governing factors in the formed morphology. This study approximates the morphology of the fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES60 copolymer membranes at $55~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ are approximated as spherical nanodomains containing water molecules with liquid-like ordering similar to their morphology at $25~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}.$ It is also proposed that this morphology changed to fractal morphology with increasing temperature (increasing the intermediate scattering decay). The domain radius and the sphere packing density were increased from $26.4\\mathring{\\mathbf{A}}$ and $28\\%$ for SPTES-50 copolymer to $32\\mathring{\\mathbf{A}}$ and $33\\%$ for SPTES60 copolymer while the intermediate scattering intensity decreased. The domain radius and packing density of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane increased from $13.45\\mathring{\\mathrm{~A~}}$ and $19.8\\%$ to $26.4\\mathring{\\mathsf{A}}$ and $28\\%$ when the temperature increased from $25~^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}$ to $55~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ with this approximation. The same increasing trend of $14.9\\textrm{\\AA}-32\\textrm{\\AA}$ for the average domain radius and $23\\%-33\\%$ of the sphere packing density was observed. The decrease in the intermediate scattering of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane compared to the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane is attributed to the disruption of the large scale morphology. The low $q$ power law decay of the hydrated SPTES-60 copolymer membrane was close to the decay of the hydrated SPTES-50 copolymer membrane. ",

        "text": "The increase in the degree of sulfonation of SPTES-60, -70, and -80 copolymers from 54.9, to 63.3 and $71.6\\%$ resulted in a shift in the position of the high $q$ scattering maxima of the hydrated membranes toward the large angle scattering regime. This peak formation is more prominent for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers with higher sulfonation degree. The decrease in the intermediate scattering intensity in the order of SPTES-50, -60, -70 and -80 copolymers is attributed to the loss of the large scale water network, intermediate fractal morphology within the polymer and onset of a morphology change to a two large scale phase morphology. The closed domain morphology of polydisperse spherical aggregates containing water molecules with fractal network were present for fully hydrated SPTES-50 and SPTES-60 copolymer membranes at $55~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ (Figs. 3 and 4a). However, substantial changes in the morphology of fully hydrated membranes occurred when the degree of sulfonation is increased to 63.3 and $71.6\\%$ for SPTES-70 and SPTES-80 copolymers at higher temperature of $55~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ . Combination of high temperature, high density of sulfonic groups, and significant amount of water molecules within the polymer backbone could have resulted in the coalescence of the small spherical ionic domains and fractal water network into a larger scale bicontinuous network of intermeshed hydrophobic and hydrophilic morphology for fully hydrated SPTES80 copolymer membrane at $55~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ The bicontinuous model originally proposed for micro-emulsion of two immiscible phases of water and oil with comparable amount based on Landau theory [38,39]. This model describes two irregular shapes with distinct boundary and has been used for intermesh of hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure when the particle shape is not well-defined [40,41]. This model proposes $\\bar{\\mathrm{I}(q)}=(a_{2}{+}c_{1}\\bar{\\bf q}+c_{2}q^{2})^{-1}$ for $a_{2}>0$ $c_{1}<0$ , and $c_{2}>0$ , a single broad scattering maxima, and power law decay of $-4$ at large scattering angles. Two characteristics lengths of $d$ and $\\xi$ are deduced from this analysis having $a_{2},\\enspace c_{1},$ and $c_{2}$ [39,40], $d$ is the domain periodicity or interdomain distance and $\\xi$ is the correlation length which has been attributed to the dispersion of d. According to this theory, $c_{1}$ is negative due to the surfactant. The absolute values of $c_{1}$ and the ratio of $\\xi/\\mathrm{d}$ should increase with increasing surfactant. The specific internal surface area can be derived from the ratio of ${\\mathsf{S}}/{\\mathsf{V}}={4\\varphi(1-\\varphi)}/{\\upxi}$ [38,39]. ",

Complete study was performed to provide understanding membranes morphology with increasing the temperature of the hydrated membranes from $25~^{\\circ}C$ to $55~^{\\circ}C$ Proposed model assumes spherical nanodomains containing water molecules forming from clustering of the sulfonation groups. This assumption was performed based on previously reported study which showed spherical nanodomains in the dry SPTES 50 membrane under HR-TEM [29]. The scattering spectra of the membranes with high degree of sulfonation (SPTES 70, and 80) changed significantly when the temperature increased to $55^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}.$ . The morphology is approximated as bi-continuous system where the hydrocarbon is the main support network containing water. This model has been recently proposed by Wnek et al. [40], Gebel [8], and Kreuer [12], Wnek also provided visualization of the hydrophobic cluster using SYBYL version 6.7 (Tripos) and HINT (Hydropathic INTeractions) computational modeling software [40]. Despite the support of the transport studies of this model [42], there is no direct visualization method for this proposed approximation. The T. S. model is also supported by high proton conductivity of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 membranes at $55~^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ where a larger number of hydronium ions in a larger domain can facilitate proton transport. A summary of the structural evolution of the SPTES membranes as a function of temperature and degree of sulfonation is illustrated in Table 3. This study attempted to study a full range of SPTES membrane nanostructure for the first time and provide an understanding of large membrane water uptakes, and their morphology and their relation with high conductivity of the membranes using both liquid like ordering of polydisperse nanospheres and bi-continuous T.S. model approximation.
