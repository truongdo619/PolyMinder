Effects of diamine chain lengths on kinetics evolution as well as on the thermal, physical and mechanical properties of the different polyamides synthesized were investigated. DAPAo was found to be the most reactive diamine because of its higher nucleophilic character. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) combined with X-ray diffraction revealed a low-order semi-crystalline structure for all polyamides. A tentative schema for the structural organization of these DAPA is proposed and shows a specific organization with local semi-crystalline segregation domains. DAPAe was found to possess the higher melting temperature likely due to higher crystal cohesion, which was confirmed by higher Young modulus in stress-strain experiments. Rheological data showed an increase of the glass transition temperature concomitantly with the increase of diamine chain length. They also revealed an increase of complex viscosity with the diamine chain length. Investigation of thermal stability showed that DAPAe degrades before DAPAh and DAPAo in connection with the number of methylene units per diamine. ",

With two reactive functions per molecule, they are good candidates to elaborate thermoplastic polyamides by polycondensation [8e10]. DA are obtained by condensation of two unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic $56\\%$ in rapeseed oil) and linoleic acids $26\\%$ in rapeseed oil), for example. They are environmentally friendly chemicals, liquid at room temperature, noncrystalline, and have high molecular weights. Polyamides synthesized from these biobased dimer acids are less crystalline than conventional polyamides and are more flexible. Then they are widely used in printing inks, as varnishes and heat-seal coatings [11e13]. ",

[13] have also worked on non-reactive fatty polyamides from dimer acid prepared with a mixture comprising polymeric fatty acids, diamines such as ethylenediamine and hexamethylenediamine, and an aliphatic monobasic acid or amine. They studied the degree and extent of reaction, the numberaverage molecular weight and the viscosity. More recently, Fan et al. [17] have investigated the thermal and swelling behaviour of soy-based-polyamides synthesized with and without $\\alpha\\cdot$ -aminoacid (L-tyrosine). Differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) showed that increasing L-tyrosine concentration in polyamides induced a significant decrease of the glass transition and melting temperatures, and of the copolyamides crystallinity tendency. As reported by Cavus et al. [8], monofunctional reactant such as acidic acid, oleic acid and propyl amine were used as comonomers to produce new dimer acid-based-polyamides. These comonomers greatly modified the final thermal properties. The influence of aromatic and aliphatic diamines in the physical properties was also investigated by Fan et al. [9]. It was found that polyamides inserting aromatic segments exhibited higher thermal performance. Very recently, a French team has developed an amazing self-healing and thermoreversible rubber by supramolecular assembly [18e21]. A mixture of fatty diacid and triacid was condensed first with diethylene triamine and then reacted with urea giving a mixture of oligomers with complementary hydrogen bonding groups such as amidoethyl imidazolidone, di(amidoethyl) urea and diamido tetraethyl triurea. Oligomers associate together to form both chains and cross-links via hydrogen bonds with recoverable extensibility. ",

This distance is characteristic of the average separation between amorphous chains in liquid-like short-range interaction [28]. Comparing the three compounds, this signal comprises, in fact, two peaks for DAPAe, not discernible for DAPAh and DAPAo. The presence of the second maximum (DAPAe) is indicative of short-range interaction between neighboured DA cycles. Additional broad and weak signals are observed at about $2\\theta=9.6\\substack{-10.2^{\\circ}}$ or $d_{\\mathrm{h3}}=8.7\\mathrm{-}9.2\\mathring{\\mathrm{A}}$ for DAPAh and DAPAo and $2\\theta=5.8\\substack{-6.6^{\\circ}}$ or $d_{2}=14.7\\mathrm{-}15.8\\mathring{\\mathrm{A}}$ for the three polymers.

        "text": "However, for DAPAh and DAPAo, $d_{1}$ increases and the corresponding peak becomes larger and presents a weaker intensity, which clearly indicates that the segregation decreases and that the number of quasi-periodic conformation increases, due to the increase of flexibility of the diamine chains. The high intensity of the peaks at $2\\theta=1.4^{\\circ}$ is in agreement with large amount of defects at the boundaries. It induces defects (grain boundaries), which are responsible of the superstructure (sp). As seen in Scheme 1, a polyamide chain is not strictly linear. Flexibility is possible by long alkyl chains. As mentioned above from the different observation, possible interpretation of $\\mathsf{X}$ -ray signals is to consider the formation of embryos of a pseudo-lamellar arrangement of the polyamides as proposed in Scheme 2. Two ideal organizations likely co-exist; the first implies stretched chains and the second, withdrawn chains, as seen in Scheme 2a and b, although these structures should be analyzed with care. Taking into account the peak line-shape, it is obvious that each family of planes is spaced from a distance d which can vary substantially. The intermediate organization, represented in Scheme 2c is thus more probable. The width of the peaks also indicates that each conformation is built with only few repetitions, which is characteristic for local intermolecular H-bond semi-crystalline segregation. Thus, the supramolecular models, presented in Scheme 2 (a and b) represent only very local arrangement of the chains; these small domains are not correlated over too long distances. Considering to the interaction present in these material, it is possible to generate “transient networks”, as already observed in the literature [18]. However, regarding to the distance $d_{1}$ of DAPAo and DAPAh, this is obvious that chains are not well packed (high conformational entropy), which could facilitate the orientations of pendant chains present in DA along the aliphatic chains, leading to various degrees of organization in the amorphous part and to higher fusion enthalpy, as observed in Table 3. On the contrary, because of the observation of a higher intensity for this peak with a lower $d_{1}$ , we can imagine that hard domains brought by short chains of ethylenediamine chains force the formation of hydrogen bonds and the phase segregation of amide groups and DA. The organization of the pendant chains on DA is thus more difficult, resulting in lower melting enthalpy and higher free volume (lower $T_{\\mathrm{g}}$ ) as previously noticed. Lower $T_{\\mathrm{g}}$ values can also be explained by the better segregation of DAPAe. Dispersion of hard segments (amides groups) in soft segments (DA) is limited (compared to DAPAo) and motion of amorphous chains is thus higher. ",

Values of $G^{\\prime}$ are similar on the rubber plateau for DAPAe and DAPAh $(1.2\\mathrm{E}{+}8\\mathrm{MPa})$ and slightly lower for DAPAo $\\mathrm{(3.4E+7MPa_{,}^{\\circ}}$ ). Moreover, before the fusion, damping values are higher for DAPAo, DAPAh and DAPAe. Thus, DAPAe is the stiffest of the three materials and DAPAo, the most flexible one. This high stiffness of DAPAe is due to the high concentration of hydrogen bonds between the amide units. Moreover, as already shown before, longer chains bring higher mobility for DAPAo, making it softer [29]. Additionally, higher polydispersity increases stress relaxation and plays a key role in the low stiffness of DAPAo [30]. The storage modulus values after $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$ decreases sharply, indicating higher macromolecular motions. However, $G^{\\prime}$ and $G^{\\prime\\prime}$ (directly linked to the complex viscosity, $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{Eta}}^{*}$ ), decrease with the diamine chain length, which is unexpected considering the higher concentration of amide units in DAPAe. Complementary studies of the evolution of $G^{\\prime}$ as a function of the frequency at $T_{\\mathrm{m+20^{\\circ}C}}$ for the three polyamides showed that the values obtained at $1\\mathrm{Hz}$ correspond to the viscous flow region and not to the rubber plateau. Then the chains entanglements cannot explain the evolution of $G^{\\prime}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{Eta}}^{*}$ . Moreover, observation of the sample by polarized light optical microscopy did not highlight any birefringence, thus confirming that there is no reminiscence of low temperature organization. This plateau could thus be explained by the persistence of hydrogen bonds at high temperature. Moreover, the higher mobility of hexane diamine allows more numerous conformations and favour interactions between chains. Another effect, which could weight in these modulus values, is the difference of numberaverage molecular weight, especially for DAPAe. The low $M_{\\mathrm{n}}$ could be responsible of the corresponding low $G^{\\prime}$ and $G^{\\prime\\prime}$ values. ",

Thermal decomposition of PA 6 starts with homolytic scission of the $N\\cdot$ -alkylamide bond so that primary amide, nitrile, vinyl and alkyl chain ends are generated [32,36]. Thermal decomposition of PA 6e6 has also been extensively studied. It has been suggested that the main PA 6e6 degradation is based on the adipic acid fragmentation to undergo cyclisation results in the formation of some cyclic products as well as carbon dioxide [32]. Even if the polyamides studied in this paper have not the same structures, compared to PA 6 and PA 6e6, we can expect equivalent degradation mechanisms especially for the alkylamide bond. Polyamides thermal degradation begins by the ruin of this last bond. DAPAe starts to degrade first because it has a higher amide units concentration. The degradation of the alkyl units, which are the major components of the chains, occurs at a higher and common temperature for all polyamides. This last phenomenon explains the similar degradation temperatures, which are determined at the maximum DTG peaks. ",

A systematic investigation of the chemical reaction kinetics, thermal, physical and mechanical properties of the corresponding products enables us to evaluate the influence of the chain length of the diamine on the properties of the polyamides. Because of its greater chain length, 1,8-diaminooctane shows a higher nucleophilic character. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction revealed low organization for the three polyamides, with local semi-crystalline segregation, stabilized by the formation of “transient networks”. $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is higher with DAPAe due to the higher proportion of amide units, which are bonded by strong hydrogen bonds. This is in agreement with higher Young modulus. Moreover, due to a higher free volume brought by pendant aliphatic chain on DA combined to lower molecular weight and better phase segregation, lower $T_{\\mathrm{{g}}}$ is observed for DAPAe then DAPAh and finally for DAPAo. Investigation of thermal stability revealed that DAPAe degrades before DAPAh and DAPAo likely because of the higher amide concentration. Rheological data revealed higher modulus values after $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$ for higher diamine chain length. ",
