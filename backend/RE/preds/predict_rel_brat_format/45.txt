Fig. 4 . Experimental SANS data of fully hydrated ( D2O ) SPTES - 60 ( lower degree of sulfonation ) , SPTES - 70 and SPTES - 80 ( highest degree of sulfonation ) membranes at 55 C. High q scattering spectra exhibits a power law decay of 4 indicating a sharp ionic interface for all hydrated polymer membranes . 4a ) SANS spectra of hydrated SPTES - 60 at 55 C ( B ) is comparedwiththe polydispersehardsphere model withliquid - like ordering and a power law decay . 4b ) SANS spectra of the SPTES - 70 indicates that the domain aggregates and fractal domains start to collapse and form bicontinuous irregular two immiscible phase morphology . Bicontinuous model was compared with SANS spectra in the q range of ( q > 0.0371 / Ã… ) . 4c ) Experimental scattering data of fullyhydrated SPTES - 80 ( B ) at 55 C compared with Tuebner Strey bicontinuous phase model .
