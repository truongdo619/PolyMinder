Table 3 Summary of membrane structural changes ( SPTES 50 , 60 , 70 , and 80 at 25 C , and SPTES 50 and 60 at 55 C ) as a function of degree of sulfonation and temperature by polydisperse hard sphere model with liquid - like ordering ( P.Y. ordering ) . T.S. bi-continuous model was approximated for higher sulfonation degree copolymers , SPTES 70 and 80 , at 55 C.
