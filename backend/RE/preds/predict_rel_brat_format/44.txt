Scattering data of series of SPTES membranes were obtained in the full hydration state with increasing the sulfonation degree in the order of 45.04 , 54.9 , 63.3 , and 71.6 % for SPTES - 50 , -60 , -70 , and -80 copolymer membranes . Complete study was performed to provide understanding membranes morphology with increasing the temperature of the hydrated membranes from 25 C to 55 C. Proposed model assumes spherical nanodomains containing water molecules forming from clustering of the sulfonation groups . This assumption was performed based on previously reported study which showed spherical nanodomains in the dry SPTES 50 membrane under HR - TEM [ 29 ] . The scattering spectra of the membranes with high degree of sulfonation ( SPTES 70 , and 80 ) changed signiÔ¨Åcantly when the temperature increased to 55 C . The morphology is approximated as bi-continuous system where the hydrocarbon is the main support network containing water . This model has been recently proposed by Wnek et al. [ 40 ] , Gebel [ 8 ] , and Kreuer [ 12 ] , Wnek also provided visualization of the hydro - phobic cluster using SYBYL version 6.7 ( Tripos ) and HINT ( Hydro - pathic INTeractions ) computational modeling software [ 40 ] . Despite the support of the transport studies of this model [ 42 ] ,
