SANS experiments were performed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) , Neutron Center for Research using 30 m NG - 7 SANS instrument with a neutron wavelength , l , of 6 Å ( Dl / l 1/4 10 % ) and three sample - to - detector distance of 1.5 m , 10 m ( l 1/4 6 Å ) , and 15 m ( l 1/4 8 Å ) , 0.001 < q < 0.3168 Å 1 at 25 , and 55 C ( accuracy of 0.5 C ) . Hydrated membranes were placed in demountable 1 mm thick titanium liquid cells ﬁlled with D2O after equilibrium in D2O ( 24 h ) . Scattered intensities were reduced , corrected for the transmission and background and placed on absolute scale . Then , circularly averaged to produce absolute scale scattering intensity , I ( q ) , as a function of the wave vector , q , where q 1/4 ( 4p / l ) sin ( q / 2 ) and q is the scattering angle . Calculations were performed using Igor Pro software [ 30,31 ] . USANS experiments covered a q - range of 0.00005 < q ( Å 1 ) < 0.01 , corresponding to a real - space length scale of 0.1 microne10 micron .
