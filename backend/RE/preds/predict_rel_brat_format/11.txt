exchange membrane ( PEM ) is the key factor on the performance of a hydrogen fuel cell . High proton conductivity , impermeability to reactant gases , high thermal and mechanical stability both in the dry and hydrated states , water uptake , dimensional stability , and low cost are fundamental characteristics of PEM for hydrogen fuel cells . The structure , dynamics , and transport characteristics of Naﬁon as commercially utilized PEM have been studied by small angle neutron scattering ( SANS ) [ 6e11 ] , small angle x-ray scattering ( SAXS ) [ 12e16 ] , quasi-elastic neutron scattering ( QENS ) [ 17 ] , and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( NMR ) [ 18 ] . Transport properties and nanostructure of sulfonated polyimide ( SPI ) membranes have been studied using pulsed ﬁeld gradient NMR and NMR quadrupolar relaxation rates determinations [ 19,20 ] , and small angle scattering methods ( SAXS and SANS ) , respectively [ 21,22 ] .
