clarity and completeness of the SPTES series analysis [ 29 ] . Fig. 2b shows the experimental scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES - 70 copolymer membrane at 25 C compared with the theoretical calculations of the model ( solid line ) . The results of the comparison of the hydrated SPTES - 50 , -60 , -70 and -80 copolymer membranes scattering data with the model are summarized in Table 1 . According to this modeling the domain radius increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 13.45,14.9,15.4 , and 16.9 Å for SPTES - 50 , -60 , -70 and -80 copolymer membranes . The hard sphere packing density increased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of 19.8 % , 23 % , 25 % , 29 % for SPTES - 50 , -60 , -70 , and -80 copolymer membranes . This could indicate that ionic domains are capable of holding more water molecules with the presence of more sulfonic groups on the polymer backbone ( increasing the degree of sulfonation ) . The high - q scattering spectra exhibits onset of a peak formation when the degree of sulfonation was increased to 71.6 % for SPTES - 80 copolymer . Pres - ence of scattering maxima can be due to the scattering from an ordered structure ( periodicity ) or the oscillations resulted from the structural factor effects or the excluded volume effect arising from short range liquid - like ordering . The onset of peak formation is attributed to the excluded volume effects related to the liquid - like ordering [ 33e35 ] . The low - q power law decay of nearly 3 was observed for all SPTES copolymers in the range of 1 10 4 < q ( 1 / Å ) < 3 10 3 . The power law decay of 3 is attributed to the presence of interacting three - dimensional fractal morphology . In addition , a Guinier plateau [ 35 ] was present for the hydrated SPTES - 80 copolymer at the very low q ( q ( 1 / Å ) < 9 10 5 ) . This is in addition to the nearly identical scattering intensity in the inter - mediate q - range ( 0.02 < q ( 1 / Å ) < 0.1 ) . It can be concluded that the change in the degree of sulfonation had little or no effect on the intermediate and low angle scattering wave vector . The low - q power law decay was nearly 3 0.1 for all SPTES copolymers . The presence of sharp interface between hydrophobic and hydro - philic domains was deduced from the power law decay of 4 at large angle wave vectors for all hydrated SPTES copolymer membranes . All scattering data presented in Fig. 2a shows a power slope of 3.85 to 4.15 which is approximated as w 4 . The presence of Porod behavior ( decay of 4 ) has been attributed to the two immiscible phase with a sharp boundary [ 35e37 ] . This shows that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains are separated with a distinct interface containing sulfonic groups . Presence of a plateau in the scattering spectra is characteristics of isolated scatterers [ 35 ] . The radius of gyration ( Rg ) of the isolated scatterers can be approximated by IðqÞ 1/4 I0expðð q2R2 gÞ = 3Þ , where I0 is the extrapolated zero scattering intensity ( Guinier approxi - mation ) [ 35 ] . Presence of the Guinier plateau in the q range of 4.3 10 5 < q ( 1 / Å ) < 8.2 10 5 for SPTES - 80 copolymer suggests segregation of the isolated large scale hydrophilic water pockets when the degree of sulfonation increased to 71.6 % . Radius of gyration of the isolated larger scale water pockets in fully hydrated
