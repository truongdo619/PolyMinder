Ionomers are important class of polymeric materials with ionizable groups on the polymer backbone or in the pendant which can phase separate to hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains [ 1,2 ] . Ionomers with ionizable acidic groups have potential application as polyelectrolyte membranes in fuel cells . Hydrogen fuel cell is an electrochemical reactor in which the proton transport from anode to cathode leads to a reaction at the cathode catalyst interface [ 3e5 ] . Therefore , transport of protons and hydronium ions through proton
