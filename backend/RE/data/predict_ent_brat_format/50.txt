there is no direct visualization method for this proposed approxi - mation . The T. S. model is also supported by high proton conduc - tivity of the hydrated SPTES 70 and 80 membranes at 55 C where a larger number of hydronium ions in a larger domain can facilitate proton transport . A summary of the structural evolution of the SPTES membranes as a function of temperature and degree of sulfonation is illustrated in Table 3 . This study attempted to study a full range of SPTES membrane nanostructure for the Ô¨Årst time and provide an understanding of large membrane water uptakes , and their morphology and their relation with high conductivity of the membranes using both liquid like ordering of polydisperse nano - spheres and bi-continuous T.S. model approximation .
