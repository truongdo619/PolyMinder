Visually observed defect free ﬁlms of SPTES copolymers were prepared by dissolving the puriﬁed copolymer in dimethyl acet - amide ( DMAc , Sigma Aldrich ) ( 5e10 wt % ) ﬁltering , placing in a ﬂat dish in a vacuum oven with a gradual temperature rise to 100 C for 24 h and 120 C for 2 h . The resulting uniform ﬂat ﬁlms were immersed for 2 h in deionized water and dried under vacuum ( 24 h , 80 C ) after they were acidiﬁed in sulfuric acid ( 4 M , 24 h ) to ensure complete conversion of sulfonic groups to their protonated forms .
