A series of SPTES copolymers with high proton conductivity of 100e215 mS / cm at 65 C and 85 % relative humidity as potential fuel cells membranes were studied . SANS studies of fully hydrated membranes showed that the nanostructure of the fully hydrated SPTES - 50 , -60 , -70 , and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 C in agreement with ionic aggregates containing water molecules with a large scale morphology network of water pockets morphology . This model predicted that the increase in the degree of sulfonation resulted in an increase in the radius of ionic domains and an increase in the volume packing density of water in the aggregates . It was assumed that the same morphology of polydisperse correlated spherical ionic domains were present in the SPTES - 50 and SPTES - 60 copolymers when the temperature increased to 55 C. Increase in the degree of sulfonation for fully hydrated SPTES - 70 and SPTES - 80 copolymer at 55 C led to a substantial reorganization of the membrane morphology which was described by a bi-continuous hydrophobic / hydrophilic network .
