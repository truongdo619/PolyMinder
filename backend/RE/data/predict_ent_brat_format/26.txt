SPTES copolymers have high proton conductivity at high relative humidities and elevated temperatures ; e.g. 65 C and 85 % RH of 100 , 145 , 175 , and 215 mS / cm for SPTES - 50 , -60 , -70 , and -80 copolymers , respectively [ 27 ] . The degree of sulfonation increases for SPTES - 50 , -60 , -70 and -80 copolymers in the order of 45.04 , 54.9 , 63.3 , and 71.6 % , respectively . SPTES - 50 copolymer has the lowest the degree of sulfonation and SPTES - 80 copolymer has the highest degree of sulfonation in this class of copolymers [ 22,27 ] . The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated ( D2O ) SPTES - 50 , -60 , -70 , and -80 copolymers at 25 C show a scattering behavior of a two phase structure ( Fig. 2a ) . The contribution of sulfonic groups to the scattering is considered to be negligible due to their small volume compared to the polymer and the water phase volume . It was visually observed that membranes do not dissociate when fully hydrated in the examined temperature . It was also determined by weight measurement that the membranes maintain the weight after deswelling . Therefore , the hydrophobic polymeric structure is the supporting network even at high water content and increased temperatures . Fig. 2a presents enhanced scattering intensity data ( vertically shifted ) for the hydrated SPTES - 60 , -70 , and -80 copol - ymer membranes in the order of 20X , 1000X , and 2 105X for the clarity of data presentation . The absolute scale scattering intensities in the medium q range of 0.02 < q ( 1 / Å ) < 0.1 are almost in the same intensity range for all SPTES copolymers . The high q scattering spectra for all copolymers exhibit a feature which is attributed to the presence of ionic domains containing water molecules . According to the scattering results , the morphology of all hydrated SPTES - 50 , -60 , -70 , and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 C can be approximated as correlated polydisperse spherical aggregates with liquid - like ordering ( P.Y. ordering ) and a power law decay [ 29 ] . The scattering data for the hydrated SPTES - 50 , -60 , -70 , and -80 copolymer membranes at 25 C were compared and quantiﬁed using polydisperse ( Schulz polydispersity ) hard sphere model with Percus Yevick liquid - like ordering [ 32e34 ] and a low q power law decay [ 29 ] . The modeling of the SPETS 50 nanostructure and its properties have been reported elsewhere but presented here for
