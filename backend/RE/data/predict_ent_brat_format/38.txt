Based on the physical observations , water saturated membranes at 55 C were swollen ﬁlms without visual dissociation . Fig. 3 exhibits the scattering spectra of the fully hydrated ( D2O ) SPTES - 50 , -60 , -70 and -80 copolymer membranes at 55 C . The inter - mediate scattering intensity decreased with increasing degree of sulfonation in the order of SPTES - 50 , -60 , -70 , and -80 copolymers . The scattering spectra of the fully hydrated SPTES - 60 , -70 , and -80 copolymer membranes start to form scattering maxima at high q range when the degree of sulfonation increased . This indicated the increase in the excluded volume due to the increase in the volume of the scatterers at higher degree of sulfonation and increased temperature ( 55 C ) . The presence of scattering maxima is more signiﬁcant for SPTES - 70 copolymer and SPTES - 80 copolymer with 63.3 and 71.6 % degree of sulfonation . The large angle scattering feature shows scattering maxima at qmax of 0.103 and 0.1108 1 / Å for SPTES - 70 and SPTES - 80 copolymers which correspond to spatial characteristics lengths ( l 1/4 2p / qmax ) of 60.97 and 56.7 Å due to concentration ﬂuctuations of hydrated domains ( hard spheres ) . The scattering spectra of the hydrated SPTES - 50 , -60 , -70 , and -80 copolymer membranes changed signiﬁcantly with increasing degree of sulfonation . This indicates a substantial change in the hydrophobic / hydrophilic morphology with increasing degree of sulfonation at 55 C which is more pronounced for SPTES - 70 and SPTES - 80 copolymers ( degree of sulfonation 63.3 and 71.6 % , respectively ) . Hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions are segregated distinctly by the sulfonic groups at the interface which is repre - sented by the Porod behavior , asymptotic behavior of w 4 for all SPTES copolymers [ 35e37 ] . The morphology of these membranes is complex and controlled by interfacial phenomena . The number of sulfonic groups per repeat unit volume and their acidity com - plemented with the chain persistent length and chain mobility are governing factors in the formed morphology . This study approxi - mates the morphology of the fully hydrated SPTES - 50 and SPTES - 60 copolymer membranes at 55 C are approximated as spherical nanodomains containing water molecules with liquid - like ordering similar to their morphology at 25 C . It is also proposed that this morphology changed to fractal morphology with increasing temperature ( increasing the intermediate scattering decay ) . The domain radius and the sphere packing density were increased from 26.4 Å and 28 % for SPTES - 50 copolymer to 32 Å and 33 % for SPTES - 60 copolymer while the intermediate scattering intensity decreased . The domain radius and packing density of the hydrated SPTES - 50 copolymer membrane increased from 13.45 Å and 19.8 % to 26.4 Å and 28 % when the temperature increased from 25 C to 55 C with this approximation . The same increasing trend of 14.9 Åe32 Å for the average domain radius and 23 % e33 % of the sphere packing density was observed . The decrease in the inter - mediate scattering of the hydrated SPTES - 60 copolymer membrane compared to the hydrated SPTES - 50 copolymer membrane is attributed to the disruption of the large scale morphology . The low q power law decay of the hydrated SPTES - 60 copolymer membrane was close to the decay of the hydrated SPTES - 50 copolymer membrane . The increase in the degree of sulfonation of SPTES - 60 , -70 , and -80 copolymers from 54.9 , to 63.3 and 71.6 % resulted in a shift in the position of the high q scattering maxima of the hydrated membranes toward the large angle scattering regime . This peak formation is more prominent for SPTES - 70 and SPTES - 80 copoly - mers with higher sulfonation degree . The decrease in the inter - mediate scattering intensity in the order of SPTES - 50 , -60 , -70 and
