A series of well-defined brush-type amphiphilic polystyrene-g-poly(2-(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate)) (PS-g-PDMAEMA) copolymers were successfully synthesized via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), using chloromethylated polystyrene (CMPS) as the macroinitiator. The self-assembly behavior of the resulting brush-type copolymers in deionized water and deionized water/acetone (v/v=2/3) mixture was studied by high performance particle sizer (HPPS). The results showed that the Z-average size of the micelles in deionized water increased with the increase of molecular weight of PDMAEMA, and the corresponding size was larger than that in mixed solvent of deionized water and acetone (v/v=2/3). The morphologies of the micelles self-assembled from PS-g-PDMAEMA in selective solvents were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). When the micelles were prepared in water/acetone (v/v=2/3) mixture and cast them on a glass slide at different temperatures (from 50 up to 200 Â°C), the transformation of the morphologies of aggregates, from needle-like solid to microcubic particles, was observed using SEM.
