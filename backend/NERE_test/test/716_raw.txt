The development of high-temperature resistant polymers and their composites is of particular interest because of their ever-growing applications. Herein, a family of branched phthalonitrile resins based on different bisphenols (Hydroquinone, 4,4′-Biphenol, m-Dihydroxybenzene, 1,6-Dihydroxynaphthalene, 2,6-Dihydroxynaphthalene) and phenyl-s-triazine, endcapping with 4-nitrophthalonitrile were prepared via a convenient condensation polymerization procedure. The relationship among bisphenol structures, thermal properties and mechanical properties were investigated in details. By incorporating the thermally stable phenyl-s-triazine segment into the branched phthalonitrile's backbone, the overall Tg (glass transition temperature) and Td (5% thermal degradation temperature) of the derived polymers were significantly improved. The resins were thermally cured to networks with 4,4′-diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS) as curing agent. The resulting networks exhibited high thermal resistance, indicated by Tg surpassing 500°C and Td as high as 575°C. Additionally, the composites exhibited high mechanical properties and dielectric properties stability at 500°C. The results suggested the merits of branched phthalonitrile polymers for applications in high-temperature resistant polymers and composites.
