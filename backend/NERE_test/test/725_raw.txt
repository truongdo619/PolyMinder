To extract improved charge carrier mobility from a benzo[1,2-b:4,3-b′]dithiophene (BdT) based polymer, PDodBdTBTz was synthesized by directly attaching 7,8-didodecyloxybenzo[1,2-b:4,3-b′]dithiophene (BdT-Dod) and 4,4′-dibutyl-2,2′-bithiazole (BTz) by Pd(II)-catalyzed Stille polymerization and characterized by 1H NMR and UV-vis spectroscopy, GPC, CV, TGA, DSC and AFM. The copolymer exhibited a p-type mobility of ∼10-5 cm2 V-1 s-1 that improved to 7.6 x 10-3 cm2 V-1 s-1 after annealing at its Tc of 230 °C. This is the highest value of hole mobility among any benzo[1,2-b:4,3-b′]dithiophene (BdT) containing polymer and more than 10 times higher than any previous report of hole mobility from any BdT based polymer.
