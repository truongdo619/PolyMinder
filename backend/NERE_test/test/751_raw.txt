The reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) copolymerization of vinylidene chloride (VDC) with methyl acrylate (MeA) was studied in the presence of poly(ethylene oxide)-based macromolecular RAFT (macroRAFT) agents of the trithiocarbonate type (PEO-TTC) in solution and in aqueous emulsion. Firstly the formation of PEO-b-P(VDC-co-MeA) diblock copolymers was performed in toluene solution at 30 °C and a good control over the polymerization with high chain-end functionality was shown. A first aqueous emulsion copolymerization of VDC with MeA was performed using one of the amphiphilic PEO-b-P(VDC-co-MeA) diblock copolymers as macromolecular stabilizer. Then, in a series of experiments the PEO-TTC macroRAFT agents were directly tested as both chain transfer agents and stabilizing agents in similar conditions (aqueous batch emulsion copolymerization of VDC with MeA at 70 °C). The influence of the nature and concentration of the initiating system and the presence or not of a buffer were studied. We demonstrated that in simple conditions, nanometric latex particles composed of amphiphilic PEO-b-P(VDC-co-MeA) diblock copolymers formed by polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA). It can thus be concluded that PEO-TTC macroRAFT agents are valuable non-ionic macromolecular stabilizers in the emulsion copolymerization of VDC and MeA and allow the formation of core-shell diblock copolymer particles in the absence of free surfactant. However, when rather high molar masses of the hydrophobic PVDC-based block were targeted, the determined molar masses deviated from the theoretical values.
