The spherulite morphology and crystallization behavior of poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT)/poly(ether imide) (PEI) blends were investigated with optical microscopy (OM), small-angle light scattering (SALS), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Thermal analysis showed that PTT and PEI were miscible in the melt over the entire composition range. The addition of PEI depressed the overall crystallization rate of PTT and affected the texture of spherulites but did not alter the mechanism of crystal growth. When a 50/50 blend was melt-crystallized at 180 Â°C, the highly birefringent spherulite appeared at the early stage of crystallization (t < 20 min). After longer times, the spherulite of a second form was developed, which exhibited lower birefringence. The SALS results suggested that the observed birefringence change along the radial direction of the spherulite was mainly due to an increase in the orientation fluctuation of the growing crystals as the radius of spherulite increased. The lamellar morphological parameters were evaluated by a one-dimensional correlation function analysis. The amorphous layer thickness showed little dependence on the PEI concentration, indicating that the noncrystallizable PEI component resided primarily in the interfibrillar regions of the growing spherulites.
