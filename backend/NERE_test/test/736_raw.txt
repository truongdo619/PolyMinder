A series of hyperbranched aliphatic polyethers with different degree of branching (DB) and molecular weights have been studied with respect to their rheological and thermal properties. The DB was shown to affect the ability of the polymers to crystallize and thereby also the rheological properties of the polymers. A low DB resulted in semi-crystalline polymers with melting points between 100 and 130Â°C. The polymers with a higher DB were essentially amorphous and behaved as non-entangled Newtonian liquids in the molten state.
