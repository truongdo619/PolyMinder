The preparation and characterization of new polymer inclusion membranes (PIMs) for proton transport is described. PIMs were prepared with different polymeric cellulose-based compounds and PVC as supports, tris(2-butoxyethyl)phosphate (TBEP) and 2-nitrophenyl octyl ether (NPOE) as plasticizers and dinonylnaphthalenesulfonic acid (DNSA) and dinonylnaphthalenedisulfonic acid (DNDSA) as carriers. The effects of the nature and content of the supports, plasticizers and carriers on membrane proton conductivity was studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). This technique was also used to evaluate the chemical stability of a CTA-NPOE-DNDSA membrane while its selectivity was monitored with respect to sodium and calcium ions through counter-transport experiments. DSC and TGA techniques were used to determine the thermal stability of these membranes. A PIM based on CTA-DNDSA-NPOE showed the highest proton conductivity (3.5 mS/cm) with no variation of its behavior during 2 months of evaluation. FTIR characterization did not show structural changes of the membrane in this period of time. Thermal analysis indicates that it is stable up to 180 Â°C. An empirical functional relationship between PIM resistance and composition indicates that increasing plasticizer and carrier concentrations enhances the conductivity of the membranes, while increasing CTA content tends to decrease this property. Transport experiments showed a good selectivity of the CTA-DNDSA-NPOE membrane for protons over calcium or sodium ions.
