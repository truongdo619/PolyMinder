Influence of oligomer end-group on morphology of poly(4-oxybenzoyl) (POB) was examined by polymerizations of 4-acyloxybenzoic acids having different acyl groups. Polymerizations of 4-propionyloxybenzoic acid, 4-hexanoyloxybenzoic acid, 4-octanoyloxybenzoic acid and 4-decanoyloxybenzoic acid in liquid paraffin at 320 Â°C yielded needle-like or pillar-like POB crystals via crystallization of oligomers. On the other hand, the polymerization of 4-perfluorooctanoyloxybenzoic acid (FOBA) afforded microspheres having needle-like crystals on the surfaces. At an initial stage in the polymerization, microspheres having smooth surface were formed via liquid-liquid phase separation of oligomers prepared from FOBA owing to the low miscibility of perfluorooctanoyl end-group. Thereby the phase-separation behaviour of oligomers changed from liquid-liquid phase separation to crystallization at a middle stage in the polymerization and then needle-like crystals were formed on the surface of the microspheres. Chemical structure of the oligomer end-group affected significantly the phase-separation behaviour of oligomers and ultimately the morphology of POB.
