The phase behaviour of blends of high-molecular weight poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) with short-chain poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) of Mw = 400, prepared by drying their solutions in a common solvent (ethyl alcohol), was studied using DSC. Upon heating of cool-quenched samples a single glass transition was observed, followed by an exotherm corresponding to cold crystallization of excess PEG, a melting endotherm, and an endotherm corresponding to vaporization of absorbed water. The temperatures of glass transition (Tg), PEG cold crystallization (Tc), and melting (Tm), along with the change in heat capacity (Î”Cp) between the polymer's glassy and rubbery states at Tg, vary with blend composition and hydration. As a result the Tg/Tm, Tc/Tm and Tc/Tg ratios for PVP-PEG blends are functions of composition. PVP-PEG compatibility is due to H-bonding of PEG terminal hydroxyls to the carbonyls in the PVP repeating units. Large negative deviations of Tg values from the calculated weight averages, found mainly for PVP-overloaded blends, signify strong PVP-PEG interaction and free volume formation.
