# 8.0.0
- Added safety check to `onProgress` hook in `PdfLoader` to prevent potential races and resets to loading state after a PDF has been loaded in. #1 Thank you @orausch ‚ù§.
- Removed `MouseSelectionRenderer` and moved any necessary logic into `MouseSelection`.
- Removed `TipRenderer` and moved any necessary logic into `TipContainer`.
- Removed `PdfLoaderContext` in favour of callback style child components, much like the original branch.
- Removed `SelectionContext` and `TipContext`, moving all functionality into a new `PdfHighlighterContext`. This streamlines the library massively and makes tasks like getting the current tip, setting a tip, getting the current selection, making a ghost highlight, etc. much simpler and accessible across an entire application.
- Added strict mode to example app for better testing.
- Fixed PDF document stacking by debouncing PDF Loading #2 .
- Removed `Comment` and added generic types to `ViewportHighlight`. This allows the user to create their own Highlight types and typehint them inside their `HighlightContext`.
- Added `highlightTip` to `MonitoredHighlightContainer` directly, so users can simply specify the component they want to display above a hovered highlight.
- Added `onCreateGhostHighlight` and `onRemoveGhostHighlight` events
- Renamed `MonitoredHighlightContainer` events
- Added tip position clipping on the left of the screen.
- Rolled back to PDF.js v2.16.05 for a better selection experience. This may change in future. #3 .
- Added TypeDocs.
- Updated example app.
- Updated usage examples
- Updated dependencies.

*NOTE: This was labelled 7.1.0 originally, but since backward compatibility is broken, the version number is being updated to be semantically corect.*

- Replaced callbacks for afterSelection with selectionTip prop and onSelectionFinished events.
