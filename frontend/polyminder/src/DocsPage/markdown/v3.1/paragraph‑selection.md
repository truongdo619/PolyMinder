# Selecting Paragraphs to Annotate

Sometimes you only need to work on a subset of a long document—intro, methods, or results, for example.  
The **Paragraph Selection** tool lets you choose exactly which text blocks will appear in the annotation workflow, hiding everything else until you are ready.

## 1. Open the Selection Dialog  

1. Click **adjust your selection** button in the top of sidebar.

2. A dialog lists every paragraph detected in the PDF, ordered by page and line number.

## 2. Pick Your Targets  

1. Tick the checkboxes for the paragraphs you intend to annotate.  
2. Use **Select All / Clear All** for quick bulk actions.  
3. Click **Save & Reload** button to confirm.

> **Tip:** You can sort the list by page number or search for keywords to locate relevant sections faster.

## 3. Apply & Load  

Press **Apply Selection**.  
PolyMinder reloads the result page with:

* **Only the selected paragraphs** visible in the PDF viewer.  
* The sidebar filtered to entities and relations inside those paragraphs.  
* Non‑selected paragraphs stored safely in the background (no data lost).

You can return to the dialog at any time to add or remove paragraphs.

## 4. Changing Your Mind  

Need to annotate another section later?  
Open **adjust your selection** again, adjust the checkboxes, and click **Apply Selection**.  
The viewer updates instantly—no need to re‑process the document.

## 5. Why Use Paragraph Selection?  

* **Focus** — reduce visual clutter and cognitive load.  
* **Efficiency** — skip irrelevant sections to save review time.  
* **Collaboration** — divide a large document among multiple annotators (e.g., Alice handles Intro, Bob handles Results).  

Paragraph selection is non‑destructive; unselected text remains intact and can be brought back whenever required.
